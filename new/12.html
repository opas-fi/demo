    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"A. L. R. These are the symbols (or Verses) of the perspicuous Book.","commentary":"This verse begins with three specific letters from the Arabic alphabet. These letters introduce the verses of the Qur’an, which is described here as a \"perspicuous Book,\" meaning it is clear and makes the truth plain. It signals the beginning of a significant message being revealed.","arabic":"الر ۚ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ"},{"verse":"2","text":"We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an, in order that ye may learn wisdom.","commentary":"Following the introduction in the first verse, this verse explains that Allah has sent this Book, the Qur’an, down in the Arabic language. This is so that people, particularly the audience it was first revealed to, could understand it deeply and gain wisdom from its teachings. It connects to the previous verse by specifying the language and purpose of the \"perspicuous Book.\"","arabic":"إِنَّا أَنْزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to thee this (portion of the) Qur'an: before this, thou too was among those who knew it not.","commentary":"Allah continues to describe the Qur’an's contents. This verse highlights that within this revelation, Allah is narrating to Prophet Muhammad the most beautiful or best of stories. It emphasizes that prior to this divine revelation, Prophet Muhammad was not aware of this particular narrative, signifying its origin is from Allah. This connects to the previous verses by introducing the specific nature of the content within the Qur’an, which is designed for understanding and learning wisdom.","arabic":"نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ الْقَصَصِ بِمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الْغَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"Behold! Joseph said to his father: \"O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!\"","commentary":"This verse marks the beginning of the story. It recounts a dream Prophet Joseph had as a young boy, which he shared with his father, Prophet Jacob. He saw eleven stars, the sun, and the moon bowing down to him. This vision is presented as a significant event that will foreshadow future developments, directly setting the stage for the narrative that follows.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لِأَبِيهِ يَا أَبَتِ إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Said (the father): \"My (dear) little son! relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is to man an avowed enemy!","commentary":"In response to Prophet Joseph's dream, his father, Prophet Jacob, immediately understood its potential significance. He advised his young son not to tell his other brothers about the dream. He feared that the dream's implication of Prophet Joseph's future high status might cause his brothers to become jealous and plot against him. Prophet Jacob warns that Satan is always looking for ways to incite enmity among people. This verse directly follows the previous one, showing Prophet Jacob's wise and cautious reaction to the dream.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَىٰ إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُوا لَكَ كَيْدًا ۖ إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"6","text":"\"Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories (and events) and perfect His favour to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - even as He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.\"","commentary":"Prophet Jacob explains further to Prophet Joseph that this dream is an indication of Allah's plan for him. He says that Allah will choose him, teach him the interpretation of dreams and events, and complete His blessings upon him and the family of Jacob, just as He had blessed his forefathers, Prophet Abraham and Prophet Isaac. This shows Prophet Jacob's understanding of the dream as a sign of Prophet Joseph's potential future role, connecting it to the lineage of prophets and divine favor. He affirms that Allah knows all things and is wise in His plans. This verse follows Prophet Jacob's caution in Verse 5, explaining the potential greatness that necessitates such caution.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِنْ تَأْوِيلِ الْأَحَادِيثِ وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ يَعْقُوبَ كَمَا أَتَمَّهَا عَلَىٰ أَبَوَيْكَ مِنْ قَبْلُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (or symbols) for seekers (after Truth).","commentary":"This verse serves as an interjection, drawing attention to the importance of the story that is about to unfold. It states that the experiences of Prophet Joseph and his brothers contain many lessons and signs for anyone who is searching for truth or seeking understanding. It signals to the listener or reader that the details of the story, starting with the events described in the previous verses, are significant and full of meaning.","arabic":"لَقَدْ كَانَ فِي يُوسُفَ وَإِخْوَتِهِ آيَاتٌ لِلسَّائِلِينَ"},{"verse":"8","text":"They said: \"Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! really our father is obviously wandering (in his mind)!","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to Prophet Joseph's brothers, revealing their perspective and feelings. They speak among themselves, expressing their belief that their father, Prophet Jacob, loves Joseph and his full brother more than he loves them, despite their being a larger and seemingly more capable group. They question their father's judgment, interpreting his affection as a significant error. This sentiment reveals the jealousy that Prophet Jacob feared in Verse 5, providing the motivation for their subsequent actions.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالُوا لَيُوسُفُ وَأَخُوهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىٰ أَبِينَا مِنَّا وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّ أَبَانَا لَفِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"9","text":"\"Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some (unknown) land, that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that!\"","commentary":"Driven by the jealousy expressed in the previous verse, the brothers begin to plot against Prophet Joseph. They discuss extreme measures: either killing him or sending him far away to a distant land where he would be lost. Their motive is to remove Prophet Joseph from their father's life so that their father's love and attention might turn solely to them. Disturbingly, they rationalize this terrible plan by suggesting that they can commit this act and then later repent and become righteous people.","arabic":"اقْتُلُوا يُوسُفَ أَوِ اطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضًا يَخْلُ لَكُمْ وَجْهُ أَبِيكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ قَوْمًا صَالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Said one of them: \"Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers.\"","commentary":"Among the plotting brothers, one voice presents a slightly less severe alternative to the options discussed in the previous verse. This brother suggests they should not kill Prophet Joseph directly. Instead, he proposes throwing him into a well. The hope is that he would be found by a passing caravan of travelers, who would take him away to a distant place, thus achieving their goal of removing him from their father's life without the ultimate crime of murder. This suggestion shows a minor variation in their plan while still driven by the desire to separate Joseph from their father.","arabic":"قَالَ قَائِلٌ مِنْهُمْ لَا تَقْتُلُوا يُوسُفَ وَأَلْقُوهُ فِي غَيَابَتِ الْجُبِّ يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ السَّيَّارَةِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"They said: \"O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?","commentary":"After plotting against their young brother Prophet Joseph, his older brothers approached their father, Prophet Jacob. They addressed him respectfully as \"O our father!\" and questioned why he didn't seem to trust them with Prophet Joseph, claiming they were sincerely looking out for his welfare. This was a tactic to soften their father's heart and get him to allow Prophet Joseph to go with them.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا مَا لَكَ لَا تَأْمَنَّا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَاصِحُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"\"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him.\"","commentary":"Continuing their plea, the brothers asked Prophet Jacob to let Prophet Joseph accompany them the next day so he could enjoy himself and play. They promised emphatically that they would take good care of him. They painted a picture of a fun outing to persuade their father, all while hiding their true intentions.","arabic":"أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَدًا يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"(Jacob) said: \"Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him.\"","commentary":"Prophet Jacob responded to his sons. He expressed that it saddened him to think of them taking Prophet Joseph away, indicating his deep affection for his young son. He also voiced a specific fear: that a wolf might attack and devour Prophet Joseph while they were distracted and not watching him carefully. This fear, though seemingly specific, was a way for Prophet Jacob to express his general anxiety and reluctance to let his beloved son go out with them. This statement by Prophet Jacob ironically provided the brothers with an idea for their later fabricated story.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنِّي لَيَحْزُنُنِي أَنْ تَذْهَبُوا بِهِ وَأَخَافُ أَنْ يَأْكُلَهُ الذِّئْبُ وَأَنْتُمْ عَنْهُ غَافِلُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"They said: \"If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!\"","commentary":"The brothers seized on Prophet Jacob's fear of the wolf as an opportunity to reassure him and counter his reluctance. They argued that if a wolf were to overpower and eat Prophet Joseph while they, a large and strong group, were present, it would mean they themselves were utterly useless or had failed completely. They used this strong statement to convince their father that his fear was unfounded and that they were more than capable of protecting Prophet Joseph. This seemed to overcome Prophet Jacob's hesitation, allowing the events planned by Allah to unfold.","arabic":"قَالُوا لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ الذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّا إِذًا لَخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not'","commentary":"Having convinced Prophet Jacob, the brothers took Prophet Joseph with them. Once they were away, they carried out their plan, agreeing to throw him into a deep well. At this desperate moment, while Prophet Joseph was facing this ordeal alone, Allah sent a message of reassurance into his heart. This divine inspiration told him that he would survive this trial and that there would come a day when he would confront his brothers about this deed, and they would not recognize him. This moment marks a turning point, assuring Prophet Joseph of Allah's protection and a future outcome beyond his immediate suffering.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا ذَهَبُوا بِهِ وَأَجْمَعُوا أَنْ يَجْعَلُوهُ فِي غَيَابَتِ الْجُبِّ ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِ لَتُنَبِّئَنَّهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِمْ هَٰذَا وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.","commentary":"After carrying out their cruel act, the brothers returned to their father, Prophet Jacob, later that evening. They approached him weeping, putting on a show of grief to deceive him and make their story believable. Their contrived sorrow was part of their attempt to convince their father that something terrible had happened to Prophet Joseph. This verse sets the scene for the false narrative they are about to present to cover up their crime.","arabic":"وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"They said: \"O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him.... But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth.\"","commentary":"Presenting their fabricated story to Prophet Jacob, the brothers claimed they had been racing each other and carelessly left Prophet Joseph behind with their belongings. They then stated that a wolf had devoured him. Perhaps sensing that their story was weak and knowing their father's deep love for Prophet Joseph, they added, \"But you will never believe us even though we tell the truth.\" This pre-emptive statement was an attempt to discredit their father's potential doubts and make him feel guilty for not trusting them, framing themselves as victims of his suspicion.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا إِنَّا ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ وَتَرَكْنَا يُوسُفَ عِنْدَ مَتَاعِنَا فَأَكَلَهُ الذِّئْبُ ۖ وَمَا أَنْتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: \"Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought\"..","commentary":"To support their lie, the brothers produced Prophet Joseph's shirt, stained with blood that was not his – described here as \"false blood,\" likely blood from an animal. However, Prophet Jacob was wise and discerning. He immediately saw through their deception, realizing that their story was concocted. He told them that their own desires and minds had tempted them to commit this evil act and invent this tale. Despite his profound grief and suspicion, he declared that his response would be one of beautiful patience. He turned to Allah alone, stating that only Allah's help could be sought against the false narrative they were presenting and the immense misfortune he was facing. This shows Prophet Jacob's deep faith and reliance on Allah in times of distress.","arabic":"وَجَاءُوا عَلَىٰ قَمِيصِهِ بِدَمٍ كَذِبٍ ۚ قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنْفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا ۖ فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ ۖ وَاللَّهُ الْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)... He said: \"Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!\" So they concealed him as a treasure! But Allah knoweth well all that they do!","commentary":"Meanwhile, as Prophet Jacob was dealing with his sons' deception, a caravan of travellers arrived near the well where Prophet Joseph had been thrown. They sent their water-carrier to draw water. When he lowered his bucket, Prophet Joseph was able to grasp onto it. When the water-carrier pulled up the bucket and saw Prophet Joseph, he cried out in surprise and delight, saying, \"Good news! Here is a young man!\" The travellers then decided to conceal Prophet Joseph, intending to sell him later like valuable merchandise. The verse concludes by stating that Allah was fully aware of everything they were doing, highlighting Allah's all-encompassing knowledge and watchfulness over these events.","arabic":"وَجَاءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌ فَأَرْسَلُوا وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُ ۖ قَالَ يَا بُشْرَىٰ هَٰذَا غُلَامٌ ۚ وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!","commentary":"The individuals who found Prophet Joseph in the well eventually sold him for a very low price – just a few silver coins. The description mentions the coins were \"counted out,\" which implies a small sum, as larger amounts would typically be weighed. This detail emphasizes how little they valued him, perhaps because they had simply found him and wanted to quickly profit without attracting attention or dealing with the complexities of having a free child. This sale marked the next stage in Prophet Joseph's journey, leading him towards Egypt, in accordance with Allah's plan.","arabic":"وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ وَكَانُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الزَّاهِدِينَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: \"Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son.\" Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.","commentary":"This verse picks up Prophet Joseph's story after he was sold as a slave in Egypt. The man who bought him saw something special in the young Prophet Joseph. He told his wife to treat him kindly and with respect, recognizing his potential value, perhaps even considering adopting him. This shows how Prophet Joseph, despite being sold into slavery, was being guided by Allah to a position of respect and influence. Allah states that He established Prophet Joseph in the land and granted him a special understanding of events and their meanings. This highlights that even difficult circumstances like being sold into slavery are part of Allah's plan, and He is in full control of all matters, even if people do not always realize it. This verse contrasts the challenging start (being thrown in a well) with the beginning of a better life under Allah's arrangement.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِي اشْتَرَاهُ مِنْ مِصْرَ لِامْرَأَتِهِ أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ عَسَىٰ أَنْ يَنْفَعَنَا أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَدًا ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلِنُعَلِّمَهُ مِنْ تَأْوِيلِ الْأَحَادِيثِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَالِبٌ عَلَىٰ أَمْرِهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.","commentary":"As Prophet Joseph grew into a young man, Allah bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge. This was a special grace from Allah, often interpreted as sound judgment and the ability to understand deeper meanings, possibly including the interpretation of dreams, as mentioned earlier. This verse explains that such gifts and high standing are a reward from Allah for those who live a life of integrity and goodness. It follows on from the previous verse by showing how Allah's establishment of Prophet Joseph in the land progressed as he matured, preparing him for the next phase of his life and the trials to come.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْمًا وَعِلْمًا ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: \"Now come, thou (dear one)!\" He said: \"Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly no good come those who do wrong!\"","commentary":"This verse introduces a significant trial for Prophet Joseph. The woman of the house, who had cared for him, developed an inappropriate attraction to him and tried to tempt him. She took steps to ensure privacy before making her bold proposition. Prophet Joseph's immediate response was to seek refuge in Allah and refuse her advances. He reminded her of the kindness her husband had shown him and stated a clear principle that those who engage in wrongdoing, violating moral and divine laws, will not achieve good results. This shows Prophet Joseph's strong character, his awareness of Allah's presence, and his loyalty and gratitude towards the man who had given him a home.","arabic":"وَرَاوَدَتْهُ الَّتِي هُوَ فِي بَيْتِهَا عَنْ نَفْسِهِ وَغَلَّقَتِ الْأَبْوَابَ وَقَالَتْ هَيْتَ لَكَ ۚ قَالَ مَعَاذَ اللَّهِ ۖ إِنَّهُ رَبِّي أَحْسَنَ مَثْوَايَ ۖ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.","commentary":"This verse describes the intensity of the situation. It states that the woman deeply desired Prophet Joseph. It also acknowledges that Prophet Joseph, being human, felt a pull towards her, but he was ultimately protected from succumbing because he saw a clear sign or evidence from his Lord, Allah. This divine intervention strengthened him and turned him away from evil and shameful actions. The verse emphasizes that this was part of Allah's plan to keep Prophet Joseph pure and sincere, highlighting his status as a chosen servant of Allah. It shows how divine grace supported him in resisting a powerful temptation.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ هَمَّتْ بِهِ ۖ وَهَمَّ بِهَا لَوْلَا أَنْ رَأَىٰ بُرْهَانَ رَبِّهِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوءَ وَالْفَحْشَاءَ ۚ إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا الْمُخْلَصِينَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: \"What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement?\"","commentary":"After Prophet Joseph's refusal and his turning away, they both rushed towards the door. In her attempt to stop him or pull him back, she tore his shirt from behind. Unexpectedly, they encountered her husband right at the door. Thinking quickly, the woman immediately accused Prophet Joseph, asking what punishment, such as imprisonment or severe chastisement, was appropriate for someone who allegedly intended harm against his wife. This verse vividly depicts the chaotic moment of confrontation and the woman's swift turn to deception to protect herself.","arabic":"وَاسْتَبَقَا الْبَابَ وَقَدَّتْ قَمِيصَهُ مِنْ دُبُرٍ وَأَلْفَيَا سَيِّدَهَا لَدَى الْبَابِ ۚ قَالَتْ مَا جَزَاءُ مَنْ أَرَادَ بِأَهْلِكَ سُوءًا إِلَّا أَنْ يُسْجَنَ أَوْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"26","text":"He said: \"It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self.\" And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus):- \"If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!","commentary":"Prophet Joseph, in response to the false accusation, defended himself truthfully, stating that she was the one who had attempted to seduce him. At this point, someone from the woman's household stepped forward to offer a crucial piece of evidence. They suggested examining Prophet Joseph's shirt: if it was torn from the front, it would support the woman's claim that he attacked her and she was resisting. This verse presents the direct contradiction between Prophet Joseph's truth and the woman's lie, and introduces the means by which the truth would be revealed.","arabic":"قَالَ هِيَ رَاوَدَتْنِي عَنْ نَفْسِي ۚ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا إِنْ كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِنْ قُبُلٍ فَصَدَقَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ الْكَاذِبِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"\"But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth!\"","commentary":"Continuing the testimony from the previous verse, the witness explained the other possibility: if Prophet Joseph's shirt was torn from the back, it would prove that he was trying to get away from the woman, and she was pulling him back, thus indicating she was lying and he was telling the truth. This logical test based on physical evidence was a simple yet effective way to determine who was speaking the truth in the situation.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِنْ دُبُرٍ فَكَذَبَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: \"Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare!","commentary":"The husband examined Prophet Joseph's shirt and confirmed that it was indeed torn from the back. Based on the witness's reasoning, this proved Prophet Joseph's innocence and his wife's guilt. The husband then remarked that this situation was an example of the cunning or strategy women can employ, acknowledging its impact. This verse shows the moment the truth was confirmed and the husband's reaction to his wife's deceit.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا رَأَىٰ قَمِيصَهُ قُدَّ مِنْ دُبُرٍ قَالَ إِنَّهُ مِنْ كَيْدِكُنَّ ۖ إِنَّ كَيْدَكُنَّ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"29","text":"\"O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!\"","commentary":"Having seen the evidence and determined the truth, the husband addressed Prophet Joseph, telling him to disregard the incident and not speak of it further, perhaps to keep the scandal quiet. He then turned to his wife, instructing her to seek forgiveness for her sin and acknowledging that she was clearly in the wrong. This verse concludes the immediate confrontation, with the husband attempting to manage the fallout by covering up the affair and assigning blame, though without administering severe punishment at this point.","arabic":"يُوسُفُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَٰذَا ۚ وَاسْتَغْفِرِي لِذَنْبِكِ ۖ إِنَّكِ كُنْتِ مِنَ الْخَاطِئِينَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"Ladies said in the City: \"The wife of the (great) 'Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray.\"","commentary":"Despite the husband's attempt to keep the incident quiet, news of it spread throughout the city. Women in the city began to gossip about the wife of the 'Aziz (a title often translated as Chief Minister or high official), saying that she was trying to seduce her young slave because she was deeply infatuated with him. They commented that she was clearly acting improperly and deviating from expected behavior for a woman of her status. This verse shows that the matter did not remain private and became a public scandal, setting the stage for the next developments in the story.","arabic":"وَقَالَ نِسْوَةٌ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ امْرَأَتُ الْعَزِيزِ تُرَاوِدُ فَتَاهَا عَنْ نَفْسِهِ ۖ قَدْ شَغَفَهَا حُبًّا ۖ إِنَّا لَنَرَاهَا فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"31","text":"When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), \"Come out before them.\" When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, \"Allah preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!\"","commentary":"This verse follows the previous one, which mentioned that women in the city were gossiping about the Chief Minister's wife and her love for Prophet Joseph. Hearing this talk, she decided to respond by inviting these women to a gathering. She prepared a meal and gave each guest a knife. While they were occupied, she asked Prophet Joseph to come out before them. When the women saw him, they were so struck by his appearance that, in their astonishment, they accidentally cut their hands. They exclaimed in awe that he was not a mere human but appeared like a noble angel, seeking Allah's protection out of sheer wonder at his appearance. This event was orchestrated by her to demonstrate to the women the reason for her strong feelings.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا سَمِعَتْ بِمَكْرِهِنَّ أَرْسَلَتْ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَعْتَدَتْ لَهُنَّ مُتَّكَأً وَآتَتْ كُلَّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْهُنَّ سِكِّينًا وَقَالَتِ اخْرُجْ عَلَيْهِنَّ ۖ فَلَمَّا رَأَيْنَهُ أَكْبَرْنَهُ وَقَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ وَقُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا هَٰذَا بَشَرًا إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا مَلَكٌ كَرِيمٌ"},{"verse":"32","text":"She said: \"There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless!.... and now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest!\"","commentary":"Immediately after the women's stunned reaction in the previous verse, the Chief Minister's wife spoke to them. She pointed to Prophet Joseph and told them he was the very person they had been blaming her for. She openly admitted that she had tried to persuade him, but he had steadfastly refused to give in to her advances and had maintained his purity. She then declared her intention to him, stating that if he did not comply with her desires from that point on, she would have him imprisoned and placed among those considered morally corrupt or lowly. This statement reveals her persistence and power within her social circle, using both her admission and a threat in front of the other women.","arabic":"قَالَتْ فَذَٰلِكُنَّ الَّذِي لُمْتُنَّنِي فِيهِ ۖ وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدْتُهُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ فَاسْتَعْصَمَ ۖ وَلَئِنْ لَمْ يَفْعَلْ مَا آمُرُهُ لَيُسْجَنَنَّ وَلَيَكُونًا مِنَ الصَّاغِرِينَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"He said: \"O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should (in my youthful folly) feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant.\"","commentary":"In response to the open pressure and threat from the Chief Minister's wife and the implied influence of the other women present, Prophet Joseph turned to Allah in prayer. He declared that facing imprisonment was preferable to him than giving in to the temptation and the immoral act they were inviting him to commit. Recognizing his own human nature and potential weakness, he humbly asked Allah to protect him and divert their schemes away from him. He acknowledged that without Allah's intervention, he might be swayed by their persistent efforts and fall into sin, acting like those who are heedless or ignorant of Allah's commands. This verse highlights Prophet Joseph's strong faith, moral uprightness, and reliance on divine support in the face of intense temptation and threats, following directly from the situation in the previous verse.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ السِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا يَدْعُونَنِي إِلَيْهِ ۖ وَإِلَّا تَصْرِفْ عَنِّي كَيْدَهُنَّ أَصْبُ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَكُنْ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).","commentary":"Following Prophet Joseph's sincere prayer in the previous verse, Allah responded to his plea. Allah protected him and diverted the trap or scheme that the women, led by the Chief Minister's wife, had set for him. This could have been through various means, such as strengthening his resolve further or creating circumstances that changed the situation. The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah is indeed the One who hears all prayers and knows all intentions and circumstances, whether they are the schemes of people or the heartfelt pleas of His servants. This confirms that Prophet Joseph's reliance on Allah was the source of his deliverance from this difficult test.","arabic":"فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ فَصَرَفَ عَنْهُ كَيْدَهُنَّ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"35","text":"Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.","commentary":"This verse describes a decision made after people had witnessed evidence pointing to Prophet Joseph's innocence. Despite the clear signs, some men in positions of authority concluded that the best course of action was still to imprison him for a period. This highlights a situation where truth and justice were set aside, perhaps to protect reputations or maintain appearances, reflecting a form of injustice within that society.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُا الْآيَاتِ لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"36","text":"Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: \"I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine.\" said the other: \"I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof.\" \"Tell us\" (they said) \"The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all).\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Joseph's imprisonment as mentioned in the previous verse, this verse introduces two other young men who were also in prison with him. They approach Prophet Joseph because they have seen his good character and wisdom. Each recounts a dream they had and asks him to interpret its true meaning for them, recognizing his ability to do good and perhaps sensing a special quality in him. This interaction sets the stage for Prophet Joseph to share his knowledge and his faith.","arabic":"وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ السِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ ۖ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَا إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَقَالَ الْآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ ۖ نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ ۖ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"He said: \"Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that (even) deny the Hereafter.","commentary":"In response to the young men's request in the previous verse, Prophet Joseph assures them he can interpret their dreams accurately and promptly. He explains that this knowledge is a gift from his Lord, Allah. Before giving the interpretations, he seizes the opportunity to explain his faith, stating that he has rejected the beliefs of people who do not believe in Allah and deny the accountability of the Hereafter. This introduces his core message and links his ability to interpret dreams to his connection with Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ لَا يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلَّا نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمَا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّي ۚ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُمْ بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"38","text":"\"And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah: that (comes) of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse where he spoke about his faith, Prophet Joseph further clarifies that he follows the way of his esteemed ancestors: Prophet Abraham, Prophet Isaac, and Prophet Jacob. He emphasizes a central tenet of their faith: the absolute Oneness of Allah, and that they would never associate any partners with Him. He describes this belief in Divine Oneness as a tremendous grace from Allah upon them and all humanity, but observes that most people fail to be grateful for this guidance. This reinforces the foundation of his message as rooted in the tradition of earlier prophets.","arabic":"وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ مَا كَانَ لَنَا أَنْ نُشْرِكَ بِاللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"\"O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or the One Allah, Supreme and Irresistible?","commentary":"Having introduced his belief in the Oneness of Allah and its connection to his prophetic heritage in the previous verses, Prophet Joseph now directly addresses his prison companions with a thought-provoking question. He asks them to consider whether it makes more sense to believe in multiple masters or deities who might differ amongst themselves, or to believe in Allah, the One and only Supreme and Irresistible power who holds complete authority over everything. This question is designed to appeal to their reason and highlight the inherent superiority of the concept of Divine Oneness over polytheism.","arabic":"يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَأَرْبَابٌ مُتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ"},{"verse":"40","text":"\"If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but Allah: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not...","commentary":"Building on the question posed in the previous verse, Prophet Joseph explains that anything worshipped or submitted to besides Allah are merely concepts or figures given names by people, without any true authority granted by Allah. He asserts clearly that all command and authority belong solely to Allah. Therefore, Allah has ordained that humanity should worship and submit to none but Him. Prophet Joseph declares this principle as the true and correct way of life, lamenting that most people fail to grasp this fundamental truth. This provides the logical conclusion to his argument for Tawhid (Divine Oneness).","arabic":"مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِهِ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنْتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُمْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۚ أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"41","text":"\"O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. (so) hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire\"...","commentary":"After presenting his message of faith in the preceding verses, Prophet Joseph returns to the request that prompted the conversation: the interpretation of the two young men's dreams. He gives a precise and stark interpretation: one will return to serving the king (referred to here as \"his lord,\" meaning master or ruler), while the other will be executed. He concludes by stating that the outcome he has predicted is a matter already decided and known to him through the knowledge granted by Allah, fulfilling his promise from Verse 37.","arabic":"يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَمَّا أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِي رَبَّهُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَأَمَّا الْآخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْ رَأْسِهِ ۚ قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ الَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: \"Mention me to thy lord.\" But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.","commentary":"Following his interpretation, Prophet Joseph spoke to the young man he knew would be released. He asked him to mention his unjust situation to his master, the king, in the hope of being freed. However, despite this request, the verse states that Satan caused the man to forget to mention Prophet Joseph to the king. As a consequence, Prophet Joseph remained in prison for several more years. This event, while a setback, is understood as part of Allah's plan, perhaps to further test Prophet Joseph and teach him to rely solely on Allah rather than human connections.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لِلَّذِي ظَنَّ أَنَّهُ نَاجٍ مِنْهُمَا اذْكُرْنِي عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ فَأَنْسَاهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ فَلَبِثَ فِي السِّجْنِ بِضْعَ سِنِينَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"The king (of Egypt) said: \"I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions.\"","commentary":"Years after Prophet Joseph's encounter with the two prisoners (as mentioned in the previous verse which notes his continued imprisonment), a new development occurs outside the prison walls. The King of Egypt has a disturbing and complex dream involving seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn beside seven withered ones. Troubled by this vision, he gathers his principal advisors and asks them to interpret the dream, seeking their expertise in visions. This event creates the need for a skilled dream interpreter, setting the stage for Prophet Joseph's eventual release.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ إِنِّي أَرَىٰ سَبْعَ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعَ سُنْبُلَاتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ ۖ يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ أَفْتُونِي فِي رُؤْيَايَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ لِلرُّؤْيَا تَعْبُرُونَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"They said: \"A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams.\"","commentary":"In response to the King's request in the previous verse for an interpretation of his dream, his advisors and chiefs were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation. They dismissed the King's vision as merely a confused mix of dreams, suggesting it lacked real meaning or coherence. They also admitted their lack of deep knowledge or skill in interpreting such complex dreams, highlighting their inadequacy and inability to help the King. This inability contrasts sharply with Prophet Joseph's known skill in interpreting dreams, paving the way for him to be sought out.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلَامٍ ۖ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَأْوِيلِ الْأَحْلَامِ بِعَالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: \"I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore).\"","commentary":"The Quran tells us that after a long time had passed, the prisoner who had been released remembered Prophet Joseph. He remembered how Prophet Joseph had accurately interpreted his dream years ago in prison. When the King was troubled by his dream (mentioned in the previous verses, 43-44) and no one at court could interpret it, the released prisoner suddenly recalled Prophet Joseph's ability. He then stepped forward and told the King's court that he knew someone who could provide the true interpretation, and he requested permission to go and find him. This moment bridges the previous events in the prison with the current situation at the King's court.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِي نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ أَنَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِتَأْوِيلِهِ فَأَرْسِلُونِ"},{"verse":"46","text":"\"O Joseph!\" (he said) \"O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they may understand.\"","commentary":"The scene shifts to the prison, where the released prisoner (the King's cupbearer) came to Prophet Joseph. He addressed Prophet Joseph as \"O man of truth,\" testifying to Prophet Joseph's integrity based on their previous time together. He then accurately relayed the King's dream about the seven fat cows devoured by seven lean cows, and the seven green ears of corn beside seven withered ones. He explained his purpose: to get a clear interpretation from Prophet Joseph so he could take it back to the King and his court, allowing them to understand the meaning of the dream.","arabic":"يُوسُفُ أَيُّهَا الصِّدِّيقُ أَفْتِنَا فِي سَبْعِ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعِ سُنْبُلَاتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ لَعَلِّي أَرْجِعُ إِلَى النَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"(Joseph) said: \"For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear,- except a little, of which ye shall eat.","commentary":"Prophet Joseph immediately began to interpret the King's dream. He explained that the dream predicted a period of great abundance, symbolized by the seven fat cows and seven green ears. He advised them to cultivate the land diligently for seven consecutive years, just as they usually would. However, he gave them crucial practical advice: after harvesting, they should leave the grain in its ears (the husks), as this would preserve it from decay and insects. They should only take out a small amount to eat during these abundant years. This advice connected his divine knowledge of the future with practical wisdom for survival.","arabic":"قَالَ تَزْرَعُونَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ دَأَبًا فَمَا حَصَدْتُمْ فَذَرُوهُ فِي سُنْبُلِهِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"\"Then will come after that (period) seven dreadful (years), which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them,- (all) except a little which ye shall have (specially) guarded.","commentary":"Continuing his interpretation and advice, Prophet Joseph explained what the seven lean cows and seven withered ears symbolized. These represented seven dreadful years of severe famine and hardship that would follow the initial seven years of abundance. He warned that during these lean years, the scarcity would consume almost all of the provisions they had stored from the good years, except for a small amount that they would have carefully preserved. This part of the interpretation highlighted the severity of the coming crisis and the necessity of following his earlier advice on storage.","arabic":"ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ سَبْعٌ شِدَادٌ يَأْكُلْنَ مَا قَدَّمْتُمْ لَهُنَّ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِمَّا تُحْصِنُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"\"Then will come after that (period) a year in which the people will have abundant water, and in which they will press (wine and oil).\"","commentary":"Prophet Joseph concluded his interpretation by revealing something not explicitly in the King's dream: that the seven years of famine would be followed by a year of relief and prosperity. This year would bring abundant rain, allowing the land to recover and yield plentiful harvests. People would once again be able to produce goods like wine and oil, activities associated with times of surplus. This additional detail, revealed through the knowledge Allah granted him, offered a glimmer of hope after the grim prediction of famine, providing a complete picture of the coming years.","arabic":"ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ عَامٌ فِيهِ يُغَاثُ النَّاسُ وَفِيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"So the king said: \"Bring ye him unto me.\" But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: \"Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare.\"","commentary":"After hearing the interpretation of his dream and the wise counsel from the man in prison, the King was deeply impressed. He ordered that Prophet Joseph be brought to him immediately. However, when the King's messenger arrived at the prison, Prophet Joseph did not rush out. Instead, he sent the messenger back to the King with a specific request. Prophet Joseph wanted the King to investigate the incident involving the women who had cut their hands at the Chief Minister's wife's gathering (mentioned in earlier verses). He knew he was innocent and desired his name to be cleared publicly and formally before leaving prison, trusting that Allah was fully aware of the truth. This action showed his dignity and reliance on Allah for justice, rather than simply accepting release based on his ability to interpret dreams.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ ائْتُونِي بِهِ ۖ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُ الرَّسُولُ قَالَ ارْجِعْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ مَا بَالُ النِّسْوَةِ اللَّاتِي قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"51","text":"(The king) said (to the ladies): \"What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph from his (true) self?\" The ladies said: \"Allah preserve us! no evil know we against him!\" Said the 'Aziz's wife: \"Now is the truth manifest (to all): it was I who sought to seduce him from his (true) self: He is indeed of those who are (ever) true (and virtuous).","commentary":"Acting on Prophet Joseph's request, the King summoned the women involved in the incident. He questioned them directly about their attempts to tempt Prophet Joseph. Faced with the King's inquiry, the women admitted they knew no evil about him, essentially confirming his innocence. At this point, the Chief Minister's wife, who was at the center of the affair, stepped forward and made a full confession. She declared that the truth had now been made clear: it was she who had tried to seduce him, and she affirmed that Prophet Joseph was indeed a man of truth and high moral character. This confession publicly vindicated Prophet Joseph.","arabic":"قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ إِذْ رَاوَدْتُنَّ يُوسُفَ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ ۚ قُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا عَلِمْنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنْ سُوءٍ ۚ قَالَتِ امْرَأَتُ الْعَزِيزِ الْآنَ حَصْحَصَ الْحَقُّ أَنَا رَاوَدْتُهُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"\"This (say I), in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones.","commentary":"Continuing her confession, the Chief Minister's wife explained her motive for speaking the truth now. One perspective is that she hoped Prophet Joseph would know that she had finally been truthful about the situation, even in his absence from the court. She may have added that Allah does not allow the plans of those who are dishonest or treacherous to succeed in the long run, acknowledging a divine principle related to justice and trustworthiness.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّي لَمْ أَخُنْهُ بِالْغَيْبِ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي كَيْدَ الْخَائِنِينَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"\"Nor do I absolve my own self (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\"","commentary":"The Chief Minister's wife further reflected on her actions, stating that she wasn't claiming to be free of blame. She acknowledged a universal human truth: that the self or soul is inclined towards wrongdoing and evil desires unless Allah bestows His mercy upon a person. She concluded by affirming Allah's attributes as Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, perhaps expressing her hope for divine forgiveness after her confession and recognition of her fault. This part adds a layer of human introspection and religious understanding to the dramatic events.","arabic":"وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي ۚ إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"54","text":"So the king said: \"Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person.\" Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: \"Be assured this day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, and fidelity fully proved!","commentary":"With Prophet Joseph's innocence clearly established by the women's testimony, and his wisdom already proven through his dream interpretation, the King was completely convinced of his worth. The King ordered Prophet Joseph to be brought to him, stating his intention to keep him close and employ him personally. When Prophet Joseph came before the King, the King spoke with him and recognized his exceptional qualities. The King then declared to Prophet Joseph that from that day forward, he held a high and secure position in the King's presence, having demonstrated his trustworthiness and proven his reliability. This verse marks a major turning point in Prophet Joseph's story, as he transitions from prisoner to a trusted figure in authority.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ ائْتُونِي بِهِ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِي ۖ فَلَمَّا كَلَّمَهُ قَالَ إِنَّكَ الْيَوْمَ لَدَيْنَا مَكِينٌ أَمِينٌ"},{"verse":"55","text":"(Joseph) said: \"Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeed guard them, as one that knows (their importance).\"","commentary":"This verse recounts Prophet Joseph's response after the King recognized his innocence and wisdom and offered him a position of trust. Prophet Joseph, understanding the impending famine predicted by the King's dream which he had interpreted, did not seek personal gain or rest from his trials. Instead, he requested a specific and crucial role: to be put in charge of the country's store-houses and food supply. He justified this request by stating his capability and knowledge, implying he was uniquely suited to manage the resources effectively through the predicted seven years of abundance and the subsequent seven years of hardship. This shows Prophet Joseph's foresight, his dedication to serving the people and saving the country from ruin, and his willingness to take on immense responsibility during a crisis. His request was not for power for its own sake, but to implement a plan based on the divine knowledge given to him to avert disaster.","arabic":"قَالَ اجْعَلْنِي عَلَىٰ خَزَائِنِ الْأَرْضِ ۖ إِنِّي حَفِيظٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good.","commentary":"Following Prophet Joseph's demonstration of integrity, wisdom, and his willingness to serve the people, Allah states that He granted Prophet Joseph established power and authority in the land of Egypt. This verse explains that Allah enabled Prophet Joseph to settle and operate with freedom and authority, a stark contrast to his previous confinements in the well and the prison. This elevated position was a direct result of Allah's mercy bestowed upon Prophet Joseph, highlighting how Allah grants His favor to whom He wills. The verse also emphasizes a principle: Allah ensures that the reward for those who consistently do good deeds is never lost, indicating that Prophet Joseph's suffering, patience, and righteousness were not in vain and led to this worldly honor and authority. This verse shows Allah's power in changing circumstances and rewarding steadfastness and good conduct. It directly follows the previous verse by showing Allah's response to Prophet Joseph's character and his readiness to shoulder responsibility.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَاءُ ۚ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness.","commentary":"While the previous verse highlights the worldly reward given to Prophet Joseph for his patience and good deeds – established power and high status – this verse adds a crucial perspective. It reminds us that while worldly rewards exist and are granted by Allah's mercy, the ultimate and best reward is found in the Hereafter. This great reward is reserved for those who possess strong faith in Allah and consistently maintain righteousness in their actions and character. This serves as a reminder that worldly success, though a blessing from Allah, is secondary to the eternal reward awaiting believers who remain steadfast in their faith and good deeds, regardless of their circumstances in this life. It connects back to the previous verse by placing the worldly success mentioned there into the larger context of divine reward, emphasizing that the spiritual reward in the afterlife is infinitely superior.","arabic":"وَلَأَجْرُ الْآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَكَانُوا يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not.","commentary":"After many years passed, marked by a period of abundance followed by hardship and famine as Prophet Joseph had predicted based on the King's dream, people from surrounding areas began traveling to Egypt, which had stored food supplies. Among those who came were Prophet Joseph's brothers from the land of Canaan. They came seeking provisions and entered the presence of the chief minister, who was Prophet Joseph. Prophet Joseph immediately recognized them, even though he was now a man in a high position, vastly different from the young boy they had known. However, his brothers did not recognize him at all, unable to imagine that the powerful minister could be the brother they had harmed years ago. Prophet Joseph chose not to reveal his identity to them at this point, as there were lessons he intended for them to learn.","arabic":"وَجَاءَ إِخْوَةُ يُوسُفَ فَدَخَلُوا عَلَيْهِ فَعَرَفَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ مُنْكِرُونَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: \"Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality?","commentary":"After Prophet Joseph had provided his brothers with the food supplies they needed, he spoke to them. Having perhaps learned about their family situation during their visit, he asked them to bring their younger brother (their full brother, Benjamin) with them on their next visit. He reassured them by pointing out that he was fair in his dealings, giving people their full entitlement of provisions, and that he was a good host, treating visitors with kindness. He implied there was no reason to fear bringing their brother with them, as he would also receive fair and hospitable treatment. This verse sets the stage for Prophet Joseph's plan to reunite with his brother and teach his half-brothers a lesson.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُمْ بِجَهَازِهِمْ قَالَ ائْتُونِي بِأَخٍ لَكُمْ مِنْ أَبِيكُمْ ۚ أَلَا تَرَوْنَ أَنِّي أُوفِي الْكَيْلَ وَأَنَا خَيْرُ الْمُنْزِلِينَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"\"Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me.\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse where Prophet Joseph kindly requested his brothers bring their younger brother, he added a stern condition. He stated clearly that if they did not bring their brother with them on their next trip, they would not receive any more provisions from him and would not even be allowed to approach him again. This demonstrated the seriousness of his request and put pressure on them to convince their father to let Benjamin travel. This condition was part of Prophet Joseph's calculated plan.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَأْتُونِي بِهِ فَلَا كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي وَلَا تَقْرَبُونِ"},{"verse":"61","text":"They said: \"We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it.\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Joseph's demand in the previous verse, his brothers acknowledged the difficulty of the request, knowing how much their father, Prophet Jacob, cherished his younger son, especially after the loss of Prophet Joseph. However, faced with the necessity of obtaining more provisions, they agreed to try their best to persuade their father to let Benjamin accompany them. They promised to make sure that they succeeded in bringing him back on their next journey.","arabic":"قَالُوا سَنُرَاوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ وَإِنَّا لَفَاعِلُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.","commentary":"As the brothers prepared to leave, Prophet Joseph secretly instructed his servants to return the goods or money his brothers had used to pay for the provisions by placing them back in their travel bags. This action was part of Prophet Joseph's strategy. He intended for them to discover their returned merchandise only when they arrived home. This would serve two purposes: it would demonstrate his generosity, making their father more inclined to trust him and send Benjamin, and it would give them a strong incentive (finding their payment returned meant the provisions were essentially free, and they would need to return with payment for the next trip) to come back to Egypt, bringing their brother with them as requested in verses 59-60.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لِفِتْيَانِهِ اجْعَلُوا بِضَاعَتَهُمْ فِي رِحَالِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْرِفُونَهَا إِذَا انْقَلَبُوا إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"Now when they returned to their father, they said: \"O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him.\"","commentary":"The narrative shifts immediately to the return of Prophet Joseph's brothers to their father, Prophet Jacob, in Canaan. They reported the most crucial information from their trip: the chief minister in Egypt had conditioned their future access to provisions on bringing their younger brother with them. Facing the reality of the ongoing famine and the need for food, they urged their father to send Benjamin with them for the next trip so they could secure the necessary supplies. To alleviate his concerns, they promised solemnly to take very good care of him.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا إِلَىٰ أَبِيهِمْ قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا الْكَيْلُ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا أَخَانَا نَكْتَلْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"He said: \"Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime? But Allah is the best to take care (of him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!\"","commentary":"Prophet Jacob's reply in this verse reveals the deep pain and mistrust caused by the past incident involving Prophet Joseph. When his sons promised to take care of Benjamin, he was reminded of the similar promise they had made about Joseph, which they did not keep. He expressed his hesitation and lack of confidence in their ability to protect Benjamin, given their past failure. He then turned his reliance towards Allah, declaring that Allah is the ultimate Guardian and the Most Merciful. This shows Prophet Jacob's profound faith and his understanding that true protection comes only from Allah. This highlights the difficult position the brothers are in, needing to convince their father despite his past experience.","arabic":"قَالَ هَلْ آمَنُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ إِلَّا كَمَا أَمِنْتُكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَخِيهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ فَاللَّهُ خَيْرٌ حَافِظًا ۖ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: \"O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity.","commentary":"After their conversation with their father (verse 63-64), the brothers opened their bags and were surprised to find that their payment had been returned to them, as Prophet Joseph had secretly arranged (verse 62). This discovery gave them a new argument to convince Prophet Jacob. They pointed out that their payment being returned was a sign of good treatment and that they had essentially received the provisions for free, reinforcing the importance of returning. They reiterated the need to secure food for their family and repeated their promise to protect Benjamin. They also mentioned that taking Benjamin would entitle them to an additional camel-load of provisions (as it seemed each person travelling was allotted a certain amount), which was significant during the famine. Finding their money returned made the prospect of the next trip even more appealing and necessary.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا فَتَحُوا مَتَاعَهُمْ وَجَدُوا بِضَاعَتَهُمْ رُدَّتْ إِلَيْهِمْ ۖ قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا مَا نَبْغِي ۖ هَٰذِهِ بِضَاعَتُنَا رُدَّتْ إِلَيْنَا ۖ وَنَمِيرُ أَهْلَنَا وَنَحْفَظُ أَخَانَا وَنَزْدَادُ كَيْلَ بَعِيرٍ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ كَيْلٌ يَسِيرٌ"},{"verse":"66","text":"(Jacob) said: \"Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in Allah's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless). And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: \"Over all that we say, be Allah the witness and guardian!\"","commentary":"Despite finding their payment returned and hearing their arguments, Prophet Jacob was still hesitant to part with Benjamin due to the past trauma. However, recognizing the family's need for provisions and the brothers' insistence, he finally agreed, but only on a very strict condition. He demanded that they make a solemn oath, invoking the name of Allah, promising to bring Benjamin back to him. The only exception to this promise would be if they were completely overwhelmed by circumstances beyond their control and physically unable to fulfill their pledge. After they swore this binding oath, Prophet Jacob emphasized that Allah was a witness to their agreement and would hold them accountable. This oath was a crucial step in convincing their father and set a high standard for their responsibility.","arabic":"قَالَ لَنْ أُرْسِلَهُ مَعَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تُؤْتُونِ مَوْثِقًا مِنَ اللَّهِ لَتَأْتُنَّنِي بِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يُحَاطَ بِكُمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا آتَوْهُ مَوْثِقَهُمْ قَالَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ"},{"verse":"67","text":"Further he said: \"O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him.\"","commentary":"In addition to the solemn oath, Prophet Jacob gave his sons a piece of practical advice before they departed for Egypt. He told them not to enter the city all together through a single gate but to use different entrances. While various reasons for this advice have been suggested (like avoiding attracting undue attention or envy), the verse itself doesn't specify the exact reason. Prophet Jacob immediately followed this advice with a reminder that his counsel could not protect them from anything that Allah had willed. He emphasized that all power and command belong solely to Allah, and true trust should be placed in Him alone. This shows that while taking practical precautions, Prophet Jacob's ultimate reliance was on Allah's protection and plan, acknowledging that human efforts are ultimately subject to divine will.","arabic":"وَقَالَ يَا بَنِيَّ لَا تَدْخُلُوا مِنْ بَابٍ وَاحِدٍ وَادْخُلُوا مِنْ أَبْوَابٍ مُتَفَرِّقَةٍ ۖ وَمَا أُغْنِي عَنْكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۖ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۖ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ ۖ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.","commentary":"After their return journey and discussions with their father, Prophet Jacob, the sons traveled back to Egypt, bringing their younger brother. As Prophet Jacob had instructed, they entered the city through different gates. This verse explains that while Prophet Jacob acted on a concern or intuition he felt, this instruction could not change anything that Allah had planned. Prophet Jacob had knowledge given to him by Allah, which included an understanding of Allah's ultimate power and decree, yet most people do not grasp this truth. His instruction was an expression of his concern, but he also understood that Allah's will would ultimately prevail, as mentioned in the previous verse (not included here) where he said, \"Judgment rests with none but Allah. In Him have I placed my trust.\"","arabic":"وَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ أَبُوهُمْ مَا كَانَ يُغْنِي عَنْهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا حَاجَةً فِي نَفْسِ يَعْقُوبَ قَضَاهَا ۚ وَإِنَّهُ لَذُو عِلْمٍ لِمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): \"Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings.\"","commentary":"Upon arriving in Egypt, Prophet Joseph's brothers, including his full younger brother, came before him, unaware of his true identity. This verse immediately reveals that Prophet Joseph recognized his full brother and, at some point after their arrival when they were alone, took him aside. Prophet Joseph revealed his identity to his brother, comforting him and reassuring him not to dwell on the difficult experiences they had both endured due to their other brothers' past actions. This private reunion and reassurance set the stage for the events that followed.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىٰ إِلَيْهِ أَخَاهُ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَنَا أَخُوكَ فَلَا تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: \"O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!\"","commentary":"After Prophet Joseph had provided his brothers with the food supplies they had come for, he discreetly placed a valuable item – the King's drinking cup – into the travel bag of his full brother. As the caravan was preparing to leave, a public announcement was made, loudly accusing the group of being thieves. This action by Prophet Joseph initiated a plan that would allow him to keep his younger brother with him, under the guidance of Allah, as explained later in the passage. This dramatic accusation follows immediately after the logistical preparations for their departure.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُمْ بِجَهَازِهِمْ جَعَلَ السِّقَايَةَ فِي رَحْلِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ أَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ أَيَّتُهَا الْعِيرُ إِنَّكُمْ لَسَارِقُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"They said, turning towards them: \"What is it that ye miss?\"","commentary":"Hearing the sudden and serious accusation of theft made by the crier, Prophet Joseph's brothers turned back, surprised and alarmed. They immediately responded by asking what item was missing, indicating their readiness to address the accusation and understand the situation. This verse shows their initial reaction of shock and inquiry following the public announcement in Verse 70.","arabic":"قَالُوا وَأَقْبَلُوا عَلَيْهِمْ مَاذَا تَفْقِدُونَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"They said: \"We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it.\"","commentary":"In response to the brothers' question, the officials stated that the King's valuable goblet was missing. To encourage its return, they announced a significant reward: a camel-load of grain, which was highly valuable during the widespread famine. This confirmed the seriousness of the accusation and set the stage for finding the missing item. The mention of the reward follows directly from the question of what was lost in Verse 71.","arabic":"قَالُوا نَفْقِدُ صُوَاعَ الْمَلِكِ وَلِمَنْ جَاءَ بِهِ حِمْلُ بَعِيرٍ وَأَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ"},{"verse":"73","text":"(The brothers) said: \"By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!\"","commentary":"Hearing that a valuable royal item was missing, Prophet Joseph's brothers vehemently denied the accusation. They swore by Allah, asserting their innocence and stating clearly that they had not come to cause trouble or steal in the land. They appealed to the knowledge of the officials regarding their character or perhaps their status as travelers seeking provisions, affirming that theft was not something they would commit. This strong denial is their immediate defense against the accusation made in verses 70-72.","arabic":"قَالُوا تَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَا جِئْنَا لِنُفْسِدَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَمَا كُنَّا سَارِقِينَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"(The Egyptians) said: \"What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?\"","commentary":"Following the brothers' strong denial and oath of innocence, the officials posed a challenge. They asked what consequence should apply to them if their denial proved false and they were found to have been lying about the theft. This question was crucial as it opened the door for the implementation of a penalty system, leading directly to the next verse where the brothers propose the consequence according to their own customs.","arabic":"قَالُوا فَمَا جَزَاؤُهُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ كَاذِبِينَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"They said: \"The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!\"","commentary":"Responding to the question about the penalty if they were lying, Prophet Joseph's brothers stated the law from their own tradition (the law of Prophet Jacob's faith). They declared that in their custom, the punishment for a thief was that the person in whose possession the stolen item was found would be taken as a bondman or captive. They added that this was how they dealt with wrongdoers among them. By proposing their own law, they inadvertently provided Prophet Joseph with the means to keep his full brother with him, as explained in the following verse, because this punishment differed from the law of the land in Egypt.","arabic":"قَالُوا جَزَاؤُهُ مَنْ وُجِدَ فِي رَحْلِهِ فَهُوَ جَزَاؤُهُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing.","commentary":"Following the agreement on the penalty based on the brothers' own law, the search began. Prophet Joseph cleverly started searching the bags of his other brothers first before finally searching the bag of his full brother, where the cup was found. The Qur'an comments here that this was a subtle plan arranged by Allah for Prophet Joseph. It explains that under the King's law in Egypt, Prophet Joseph would not have been permitted to detain his brother. However, by prompting the brothers to declare their *own* law (where the thief becomes a bondman), Allah made it possible for Prophet Joseph to keep his brother according to the rule they themselves had agreed upon. This verse highlights Allah's wisdom in arranging circumstances and elevating those He wills in knowledge, reminding us that Allah is the ultimate source of all knowledge. The search and the finding of the cup naturally follow the agreement on the penalty in Verse 75.","arabic":"فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَاءِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ اسْتَخْرَجَهَا مِنْ وِعَاءِ أَخِيهِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كِدْنَا لِيُوسُفَ ۖ مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِي دِينِ الْمَلِكِ إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَاءَ اللَّهُ ۚ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۗ وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"77","text":"They said: \"If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).\" But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): \"Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!\"","commentary":"Upon the discovery of the cup in the younger brother's bag, the other brothers' reaction, fueled perhaps by old resentments, was to attribute the act to a family tendency, saying that if this brother stole, another brother of his (referring to Prophet Joseph himself in the past) had also stolen before. Prophet Joseph, hearing this, did not reveal his identity or confront them directly about their accusation. He kept his inner thoughts to himself, knowing the truth. He internally thought that their position (making such a false accusation or carrying such resentment) was actually far worse, and that Allah knew the full truth of what they were saying. This verse shows the brothers' immediate attempt to distance themselves or justify the situation based on past events, and Prophet Joseph's restrained, knowing reaction, setting the stage for their plea in the following verses (not included here).","arabic":"قَالُوا إِنْ يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۚ فَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِي نَفْسِهِ وَلَمْ يُبْدِهَا لَهُمْ ۚ قَالَ أَنْتُمْ شَرٌّ مَكَانًا ۖ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"They said: \"O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good.\"","commentary":"Following the discovery of the King's goblet in their youngest brother's bag and the agreement that the one with whom it was found should be held as a consequence according to their own law, the brothers found themselves in a very difficult situation. They were deeply concerned about how they would explain this to their elderly father, Prophet Jacob, who loved this youngest son intensely, especially after the loss of Prophet Joseph years before. In this verse, they appeal to Prophet Joseph, acknowledging his high position (\"O exalted one\"). They explain that their youngest brother has a father who is very old and venerable, suggesting that his absence would cause him immense grief. As a result, they offer a substitute, asking Prophet Joseph to take one of them instead. They appeal to his character, saying that they see him as a kind and generous person, hoping this plea will move him.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا أَيُّهَا الْعَزِيزُ إِنَّ لَهُ أَبًا شَيْخًا كَبِيرًا فَخُذْ أَحَدَنَا مَكَانَهُ ۖ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"He said: \"Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully.","commentary":"In response to the brothers' plea to take a substitute, Prophet Joseph firmly rejects their offer. He states clearly that he cannot take anyone other than the person with whom the lost property was found. He expresses this by saying, \"Allah forbid,\" indicating that taking an innocent person in place of the one where the item was found would be contrary to what is right and just. He emphasizes that doing so would be acting wrongfully. This response upheld the agreed-upon consequence based on their own law and demonstrated a commitment to fairness, ensuring that only the person found with the item would be held, without making an exception based on the brothers' emotional appeal or their offer of substitution. His refusal set the stage for the unfolding of future events in the story.","arabic":"قَالَ مَعَاذَ اللَّهِ أَنْ نَأْخُذَ إِلَّا مَنْ وَجَدْنَا مَتَاعَنَا عِنْدَهُ إِنَّا إِذًا لَظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"And he raised his parents high on the throne (of dignity), and they fell down in prostration, (all) before him. He said: \"O my father! this is the fulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert, (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord understandeth best the mysteries of all that He planneth to do, for verily He is full of knowledge and wisdom.","commentary":"This verse brings the story of Prophet Joseph to a powerful conclusion, connecting back to the beginning of the narrative. After years of separation and hardship, Prophet Joseph is reunited with his family in Egypt. The verse describes Prophet Joseph honoring his parents by seating them in a place of dignity alongside him. His parents and brothers then prostrate before him. This act is understood not as worship, but as a form of deep respect and salutation customary at the time, symbolizing the fulfillment of the dream Prophet Joseph had as a child, where the sun, moon, and eleven stars prostrated before him.\n\nProphet Joseph acknowledges this moment as the realization of that dream, attributing its fulfillment to Allah. He reflects on Allah's grace towards him, mentioning being released from prison and his family being brought from the desert, highlighting that even after challenges and the discord instigated by Satan among his brothers, Allah's plan prevailed. He concludes by affirming that Allah understands all hidden matters and plans, possessing perfect knowledge and wisdom. This verse transitions from the emotional reunion to a moment of reflection and gratitude for Allah's guidance and blessings throughout his challenging journey.","arabic":"وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّوا لَهُ سُجَّدًا ۖ وَقَالَ يَا أَبَتِ هَٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَايَ مِنْ قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّي حَقًّا ۖ وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِي إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِي مِنَ السِّجْنِ وَجَاءَ بِكُمْ مِنَ الْبَدْوِ مِنْ بَعْدِ أَنْ نَزَغَ الشَّيْطَانُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِي ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَطِيفٌ لِمَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"101","text":"\"O my Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events,- O Thou Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Take Thou my soul (at death) as one submitting to Thy will (as a Muslim), and unite me with the righteous.\"","commentary":"Following the joyous reunion and reflection on Allah's blessings in the previous verse, Prophet Joseph turns directly to Allah in prayer. He expresses gratitude for the position of authority he has been given and for the knowledge of interpreting dreams and understanding the deeper meaning of events, which Allah has taught him. He addresses Allah as the Creator of everything in the heavens and the earth, recognizing Allah as his ultimate Protector and Guardian in both this life and the life to come.\n\nProphet Joseph's prayer culminates in his most important request: that he may die in a state of complete submission to Allah's will (which is the meaning of being a Muslim), and that he be gathered with the righteous people in the Hereafter. This prayer shows that despite achieving worldly success, power, and the happiness of family reunion, Prophet Joseph's ultimate focus and desire is spiritual—to remain devoted to Allah until his last breath and to attain Allah's pleasure and be among the righteous. This serves as a powerful reminder that true success lies in one's relationship with Allah, transcending temporary worldly achievements or family joys.","arabic":"رَبِّ قَدْ آتَيْتَنِي مِنَ الْمُلْكِ وَعَلَّمْتَنِي مِنْ تَأْوِيلِ الْأَحَادِيثِ ۚ فَاطِرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَنْتَ وَلِيِّي فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۖ تَوَفَّنِي مُسْلِمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: \"Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.","commentary":"This verse describes what happened after Prophet Joseph, who was serving as a high official in Egypt, detained his youngest brother. His other brothers had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the official to release him. When they realized there was no hope of getting their brother back, they withdrew to hold a private meeting. The eldest brother reminded them of the solemn promise they had made to their father to bring his youngest son back safely, and also recalled their earlier failure concerning Prophet Joseph years ago. Because of this past failure and their promise, he declared he would not leave Egypt unless his father gave him permission or unless Allah decided otherwise, acknowledging that Allah is the best one to make such decisions. This sets the stage for the others to return home to face their father with the difficult news.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا اسْتَيْأَسُوا مِنْهُ خَلَصُوا نَجِيًّا ۖ قَالَ كَبِيرُهُمْ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ أَبَاكُمْ قَدْ أَخَذَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَوْثِقًا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَمِنْ قَبْلُ مَا فَرَّطْتُمْ فِي يُوسُفَ ۖ فَلَنْ أَبْرَحَ الْأَرْضَ حَتَّىٰ يَأْذَنَ لِي أَبِي أَوْ يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ لِي ۖ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَاكِمِينَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"\"Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen!","commentary":"Following the eldest brother's decision to stay behind in Egypt (as mentioned in the previous verse), he instructed the others on what to tell their father. He told them to return and explain that his youngest son had committed theft (based on the official's claim) and was detained. They were to emphasize that they were only reporting what they saw happen and that they could not have known or prevented something that was unforeseen by them.","arabic":"ارْجِعُوا إِلَىٰ أَبِيكُمْ فَقُولُوا يَا أَبَانَا إِنَّ ابْنَكَ سَرَقَ وَمَا شَهِدْنَا إِلَّا بِمَا عَلِمْنَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِلْغَيْبِ حَافِظِينَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"\"'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.'\"","commentary":"Continuing the instructions from the previous verse, the eldest brother told his brothers to suggest that if their father doubted their story, he could verify it by asking the people of the town in Egypt where they had stayed, as well as the members of the caravan they traveled with. This was meant to lend credibility to their account by pointing to external witnesses.","arabic":"وَاسْأَلِ الْقَرْيَةَ الَّتِي كُنَّا فِيهَا وَالْعِيرَ الَّتِي أَقْبَلْنَا فِيهَا ۖ وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"Jacob said: \"Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom.\"","commentary":"Upon hearing the news about his youngest son, Prophet Jacob's immediate reaction is revealed in this verse. He did not believe his sons' story, sensing that they had fabricated it to explain the situation. Despite the renewed grief this news brought, he expressed the need for steadfast patience. He also voiced a deep hope that Allah, who is All-Knowing and Wise, might ultimately return all his sons (Prophet Joseph, his youngest brother, and the eldest who stayed behind) to him. This shows his profound trust in Allah's power and wisdom, even in the face of overwhelming sorrow, and contrasts with his sons' perceived lack of truthfulness.","arabic":"قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنْفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا ۖ فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ ۖ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَأْتِيَنِي بِهِمْ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And he turned away from them, and said: \"How great is my grief for Joseph!\" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy.","commentary":"Following his expression of patience and hope in the previous verse, Prophet Jacob turned away from his sons. The news about his youngest son intensely reminded him of his long-lost son, Prophet Joseph. He expressed the overwhelming depth of his grief for Joseph, a sorrow that had never left him. This immense sadness caused his eyes to lose their sight due to the intensity of his sorrow, and he succumbed to silent grief. This paints a powerful picture of a father's enduring pain and shows how the new calamity reawakened his deep wound.","arabic":"وَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا أَسَفَىٰ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَابْيَضَّتْ عَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْحُزْنِ فَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"85","text":"They said: \"By Allah! (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!\"","commentary":"Observing their father's profound and enduring grief for Prophet Joseph, his sons reacted rather harshly. Swearing by Allah, they told him that he would continue remembering Joseph until he was on the verge of death from sorrow or had actually died. This statement reflects their impatience with his persistent grief and implies that his hope of seeing Joseph again was futile, highlighting their lack of empathy for their father's deep emotional state.","arabic":"قَالُوا تَاللَّهِ تَفْتَأُ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ حَتَّىٰ تَكُونَ حَرَضًا أَوْ تَكُونَ مِنَ الْهَالِكِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"He said: \"I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not...","commentary":"In response to his sons' insensitive remarks (from the previous verse) about his never-ending grief, Prophet Jacob clarified his state of mind. He explained that he wasn't complaining to them or to anyone else about his distress and anguish; rather, he was expressing it solely to Allah. He then made a profound statement indicating that he possessed a knowledge and understanding of Allah's ways, mercy, and power that his sons did not. This highlights his strong faith and deep connection with the Divine, which allowed him to endure hardship with a different perspective.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَشْكُو بَثِّي وَحُزْنِي إِلَى اللَّهِ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"\"O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah's Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith.\"","commentary":"Despite his grief and loss of sight, and having been told by his sons that his hope was futile, Prophet Jacob did not despair. Building on his trust in Allah mentioned in the previous verse, he instructed his sons to go back to Egypt and diligently search for news about Prophet Joseph and his brother. He emphatically urged them never to lose hope in Allah's comforting mercy, stating a fundamental principle: only those who lack faith truly despair of Allah's mercy. This command reflects his enduring hope and faith in Allah's ability to bring about unexpected outcomes, setting them on the path for their final journey back to Egypt.","arabic":"يَا بَنِيَّ اذْهَبُوا فَتَحَسَّسُوا مِنْ يُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ وَلَا تَيْأَسُوا مِنْ رَوْحِ اللَّهِ ۖ إِنَّهُ لَا يَيْأَسُ مِنْ رَوْحِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْكَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"Then, when they came (back) into (Joseph's) presence they said: \"O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty capital: so pay us full measure, (we pray thee), and treat it as charity to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable.\"","commentary":"Following their father's instruction (in the previous verse), the brothers returned to Egypt for the third time. This time, however, they were in a state of severe hardship due to the ongoing famine. When they came before the powerful official (Prophet Joseph, though they still didn't recognize him), they spoke in a pleading tone. They explained that distress had afflicted them and their family and that they had very little to offer in exchange for grain. They asked him to give them the full amount they needed and requested him to consider it an act of charity, reminding him that Allah rewards those who are charitable. This desperate appeal sets the stage for the official's response and the dramatic revelation that is about to occur.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا عَلَيْهِ قَالُوا يَا أَيُّهَا الْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا الضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَاعَةٍ مُزْجَاةٍ فَأَوْفِ لَنَا الْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَجْزِي الْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"He said: \"Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother, not knowing (what ye were doing)?\"","commentary":"Upon hearing their plea for help and charity, the powerful official (Prophet Joseph) responded with a question that subtly alluded to the past, directly connecting to their request and the history between them. He asked them if they recalled how they had treated Prophet Joseph and his brother long ago, implying that they had acted without fully understanding the consequences or the gravity of their actions. This question, coming at this critical moment, is the first hint that sets their minds racing and leads them to the shocking realization of his true identity, following their state of desperation presented in the previous verse.","arabic":"قَالَ هَلْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ بِيُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ إِذْ أَنْتُمْ جَاهِلُونَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"They said: \"Art thou indeed Joseph?\" He said, \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us (all): behold, he that is righteous and patient,- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost, of those who do right.\"","commentary":"After much hardship and seeking aid, Prophet Joseph's brothers found themselves in a difficult situation, appealing to the Chief Minister of Egypt for help. As they spoke, something about the man's voice and appearance sparked a sudden thought: could this powerful figure actually be their long-lost brother, Joseph? Overwhelmed by the realization, they asked him directly if he was indeed Joseph. Prophet Joseph confirmed their suspicion, revealing his identity and introducing his brother. He acknowledged that this outcome was a result of Allah's grace upon them both. He then shared a profound lesson: anyone who lives with reverence for Allah and remains patient through difficulty will find that Allah never neglects to reward those who do good. This verse marks a pivotal moment, moving from the brothers' desperation to the stunning revelation of Joseph's identity.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَإِنَّكَ لَأَنْتَ يُوسُفُ ۖ قَالَ أَنَا يُوسُفُ وَهَٰذَا أَخِي ۖ قَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا ۖ إِنَّهُ مَنْ يَتَّقِ وَيَصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"They said: \"By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin!\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Joseph's revelation in the previous verse, his brothers were struck by the immense difference between their past actions towards him and his current position and kindness. They were deeply ashamed as they stood before him, acknowledging his high status and recognizing Allah's preference for him. With humility, they confessed their past mistakes and admitted they had been wrongdoers. This statement highlights their dawning awareness of the consequences of their actions and the divine wisdom behind Joseph's journey.","arabic":"قَالُوا تَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ آثَرَكَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنْ كُنَّا لَخَاطِئِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"He said: \"This day let no reproach be (cast) on you: Allah will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!","commentary":"In response to his brothers' confession and remorse in the previous verse, Prophet Joseph displayed remarkable charity and forgiveness. He immediately told them that they would not be blamed or reproached for their past actions on this day. He then prayed to Allah to forgive them, recognizing Allah as the Most Merciful. This act of forgiveness demonstrated Prophet Joseph's noble character, showing that the trials he endured had not left him with bitterness.","arabic":"قَالَ لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ ۖ يَغْفِرُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"\"Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see (clearly). Then come ye (here) to me together with all your family.\"","commentary":"Having granted forgiveness to his brothers in the previous verse, Prophet Joseph's thoughts turned to his father, Prophet Jacob, who had suffered deeply from his and his brother's absence. Knowing his father's intense grief had led to the loss of his eyesight, Prophet Joseph instructed his brothers to take his shirt back to their father and place it over his face, assuring them that his father would regain his sight. He then told them to return to Egypt, bringing their entire family with them. This instruction sets the stage for the long-awaited reunion and the fulfillment of Joseph's childhood dream.","arabic":"اذْهَبُوا بِقَمِيصِي هَٰذَا فَأَلْقُوهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِ أَبِي يَأْتِ بَصِيرًا وَأْتُونِي بِأَهْلِكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"When the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: \"I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph: Nay, think me not a dotard.\"","commentary":"As the caravan carrying Prophet Joseph's shirt departed from Egypt and began its journey back, a remarkable event occurred far away in Canaan. Prophet Jacob, Prophet Joseph's father, sensed the presence or scent of Joseph. He announced this to those around him, anticipating their disbelief. He felt compelled to add that they should not dismiss his perception as the ramblings of an old man losing his mind, implying a deeper connection or knowledge that they lacked. This verse shows the profound spiritual state of Prophet Jacob and his enduring hope and connection to his son, despite the long separation and lack of concrete evidence. It builds anticipation for the outcome of Prophet Joseph's instruction in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا فَصَلَتِ الْعِيرُ قَالَ أَبُوهُمْ إِنِّي لَأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ ۖ لَوْلَا أَنْ تُفَنِّدُونِ"},{"verse":"95","text":"They said: \"By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind.\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Jacob's statement in the previous verse that he could sense Prophet Joseph's presence, those with him were skeptical. They found his claim difficult to believe, especially after so many years and without any news of Joseph being alive. Their reaction, expressed by swearing by Allah, was to dismiss his feeling as mere illusion, suggesting he was still caught up in his old preoccupations and was not thinking clearly due to old age and grief. This highlights the contrast between ordinary perception and the spiritual insight granted to prophets.","arabic":"قَالُوا تَاللَّهِ إِنَّكَ لَفِي ضَلَالِكَ الْقَدِيمِ"},{"verse":"96","text":"Then when the bearer of the good news came, He cast (the shirt) over his face, and he forthwith regained clear sight. He said: \"Did I not say to you, 'I know from Allah that which ye know not?'\"","commentary":"The narrative moves quickly to the moment the messenger carrying Prophet Joseph's shirt arrived. The messenger placed the shirt over Prophet Jacob's face, fulfilling Prophet Joseph's instruction. Immediately, Prophet Jacob's eyesight was restored. Witnessing this miraculous event, Prophet Jacob reminded those who had doubted him (as seen in the previous verse) of what he had told them earlier – that he knew things from Allah that they did not. This confirmed the truth of his spiritual insight and the power of Allah's will, validating his unwavering hope and knowledge about his son.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا أَنْ جَاءَ الْبَشِيرُ أَلْقَاهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ فَارْتَدَّ بَصِيرًا ۖ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"They said: \"O our father! ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we were truly at fault.\"","commentary":"After witnessing the restoration of Prophet Jacob's sight and hearing his powerful statement about his knowledge from Allah (in the previous verse), his sons were deeply affected. Confronted by the miraculous confirmation of Joseph's existence and the reality of their past actions, they turned to their father. They humbly acknowledged their sins and admitted that they had been truly wrong, begging him to pray to Allah for their forgiveness. This marks a turning point in their journey, showing their remorse and seeking reconciliation.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا اسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا إِنَّا كُنَّا خَاطِئِينَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"He said: \"Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you: for he is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"","commentary":"Responding to his sons' plea for forgiveness in the previous verse, Prophet Jacob, perhaps still processing the events and their past actions, promised to pray to Allah for their forgiveness. He affirmed that Allah is indeed Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful. While he didn't grant immediate forgiveness himself, his promise to intercede for them with Allah indicated a path towards reconciliation and acknowledged the possibility of divine mercy for their sins.","arabic":"قَالَ سَوْفَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكُمْ رَبِّي ۖ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"99","text":"Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself, and said: \"Enter ye Egypt (all) in safety if it please Allah.\"","commentary":"The story leaps forward to the grand reunion in Egypt. After traveling back with Prophet Joseph's brothers, the entire family, including Prophet Jacob and Prophet Joseph's mother (or aunt, according to some interpretations), entered Prophet Joseph's presence. Prophet Joseph welcomed his parents warmly, bringing them close to him and arranging for them to reside with him. Addressing his entire family, he invited them to enter Egypt in peace and safety, acknowledging that this was all happening by the will of Allah. This verse beautifully captures the culmination of their long separation and the beginning of a new chapter for the reunited family under Joseph's care, setting the scene for the ultimate fulfillment of his childhood dream.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىٰ إِلَيْهِ أَبَوَيْهِ وَقَالَ ادْخُلُوا مِصْرَ إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ آمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal by inspiration unto thee; nor wast thou (present) with them then when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots.","commentary":"This verse marks a transition, concluding the detailed narrative of Prophet Joseph. It tells Prophet Muhammad that this account is a story of past events, unseen by him, which Allah has revealed to him through divine inspiration. It emphasizes that Prophet Muhammad was not present when Prophet Joseph's brothers made their plans or when others schemed against him. This highlights that the source of this detailed and intricate story is divine revelation, underscoring the truthfulness and miraculous nature of the Qur’an.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَاءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ ۖ وَمَا كُنْتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ أَجْمَعُوا أَمْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَمْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently thou dost desire it.","commentary":"Following the presentation of such a clear, divinely revealed story, this verse addresses Prophet Muhammad, acknowledging his deep desire for people to believe. However, it states a reality: despite the clarity of the message and the Prophet's sincere efforts, the majority of people will not embrace faith. This sets a context for understanding human resistance to the truth, which is further explored in the subsequent verses. It links directly to the previous verse by showing that even powerful divine signs like the Qur'an's stories are not enough to sway most people.","arabic":"وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"And no reward dost thou ask of them for this: it is no less than a message for all creatures.","commentary":"This verse adds another point about the message's accessibility and the Prophet's sincerity. It states that Prophet Muhammad does not ask for any payment or reward from people for conveying this message. The message itself is a guidance and reminder from Allah for all of humanity, freely available to everyone. This contrasts with seeking personal gain, further highlighting the message's pure and divine nature and making the rejection of it in the previous verse even more striking.","arabic":"وَمَا تَسْأَلُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ ۚ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ لِلْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"105","text":"And how many Signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn (their faces) away from them!","commentary":"Expanding on why people fail to believe (as mentioned in verse 103), this verse points to the countless signs of Allah's existence and power scattered throughout the universe. These include the wonders of the heavens, the earth, nature, and life itself – phenomena that clearly indicate a Creator. The verse expresses surprise that people pass by these signs daily, yet actively choose to ignore them and turn away, failing to reflect on their meaning. This turning away from the observable signs of creation complements their turning away from the revealed signs in the Qur'an.","arabic":"وَكَأَيِّنْ مِنْ آيَةٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ يَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهَا وَهُمْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"106","text":"And most of them believe not in Allah without associating (other as partners) with Him!","commentary":"This verse delves deeper into the nature of people's disbelief or incomplete faith. It explains that even among those who might profess some form of belief in Allah, most do not believe in Him purely. They associate other things, beings, or values with Allah, giving them a status or importance that belongs only to Allah. This association, in various forms, dilutes the concept of Allah's absolute oneness and ultimate authority, preventing a complete and sincere submission to Him alone. This explains *how* their belief is deficient, providing a reason for the lack of pure faith mentioned earlier.","arabic":"وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُمْ مُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"107","text":"Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of Allah,- or of the coming against them of the (final) Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not?","commentary":"This verse serves as a warning and a call to reflection. Given their tendency to disbelieve, turn away from signs, and associate partners with Allah, it asks why they feel safe or secure. It highlights the potential for Allah's punishment to come upon them unexpectedly in this life, or for the ultimate judgment, the Final Hour, to arrive suddenly when they are unaware. This urges people to abandon their heedlessness and consider the serious consequences of their actions and beliefs before it is too late. It connects the previous descriptions of people's deficient faith to the potential outcomes.","arabic":"أَفَأَمِنُوا أَنْ تَأْتِيَهُمْ غَاشِيَةٌ مِنْ عَذَابِ اللَّهِ أَوْ تَأْتِيَهُمُ السَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Say thou: \"This is my way: I do invite unto Allah,- on evidence clear as the seeing with one's eyes,- I and whoever follows me. Glory to Allah! and never will I join gods with Allah!\"","commentary":"In contrast to the description of those who disbelieve or associate partners with Allah, this verse instructs Prophet Muhammad to declare his clear path. He is to state that his way, and the way of those who follow him, is to invite people to Allah based on clear, certain knowledge, as evident as seeing with one's own eyes. It emphasizes the declaration of Allah's glory and a firm rejection of associating any partners with Him in any form. This verse draws a clear distinction between the path of pure faith and any path that involves associating others with Allah, providing a definitive statement of identity for the believers.","arabic":"قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Nor did We send before thee (as messengers) any but men, whom we did inspire,- (men) living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? But the home of the hereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand?","commentary":"This verse provides context for Prophet Muhammad's messengership, stating that all previous messengers sent by Allah were also human men who lived among people in towns and received divine revelation. It challenges the audience by asking if they have traveled the land and observed the fate of past communities who rejected their messengers. The ruins and histories serve as tangible signs of the consequences of disbelief. The verse contrasts the temporary nature of this life with the eternal goodness of the hereafter for those who are mindful of Allah and do right, urging people to use their reason to understand these lessons and choose the better, lasting outcome. This connects back to the story of Prophet Joseph and other messengers whose histories hold lessons.","arabic":"وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَىٰ ۗ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۗ وَلَدَارُ الْآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا ۗ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"110","text":"(Respite will be granted) until, when the messengers give up hope (of their people) and (come to) think that they were treated as liars, there reaches them Our help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin.","commentary":"This verse describes a critical and often difficult phase faced by Allah's messengers and their followers. It speaks of a point where, after enduring immense hardship, rejection, and feeling abandoned, the messengers might reach a state of despair, feeling their message has been completely rejected and they have been considered liars by their people. It is precisely at this point of extreme trial, when human efforts seem exhausted, that Allah's help arrives, bringing deliverance for those destined to be saved. In contrast, the punishment of Allah is inevitable for those who persist in wrongdoing and disbelief and cannot be averted by anything. This verse reveals a pattern of divine intervention that follows periods of severe testing, linking back to the trials described in Prophet Joseph's story and the histories of other messengers mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"حَتَّىٰ إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُوا جَاءَهُمْ نَصْرُنَا فَنُجِّيَ مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُنَا عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"111","text":"There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe.","commentary":"Concluding the discussion initiated after the story of Prophet Joseph, this verse summarizes the purpose and nature of the Qur'an's narratives, like the one just told. It states that these stories contain valuable lessons for those who possess understanding and reflect deeply. It affirms that the Qur'an is not a fabricated tale but is a divine revelation that confirms the truth of earlier scriptures. It describes the Qur'an as a detailed explanation of matters necessary for guidance, a guide in itself, and a source of mercy, specifically for those who sincerely believe.
