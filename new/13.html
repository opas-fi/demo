    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority); He has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law)! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.","commentary":"This verse begins with specific letters from the Arabic alphabet (Alif, Lam, Mim, Ra), which appear at the start of several chapters in the Qur'an and are known only to Allah. It then states that these are \"signs of the Book,\" meaning they point to the truth and miraculous nature of the Qur'an itself. The verse emphasizes that what has been revealed to Prophet Muhammad from his Lord, Allah, is the absolute Truth, without any falsehood. However, it notes with regret that despite this clear truth, most people do not believe in it.","arabic":"اللَّهُ الَّذِي رَفَعَ السَّمَاوَاتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا ۖ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ ۖ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ ۖ كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لِأَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى ۚ يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ يُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَاءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"2","text":"And it is He who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o'er the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider!","commentary":"Following the declaration of the Qur'an's truth in Verse 1, this verse begins to present grand signs of Allah's power in the universe. It describes Allah as the One who raised the vast heavens without any visible support, demonstrating His immense capability. It mentions His being established on the Throne of Authority, indicating His absolute control over all creation. Allah has also made the sun and moon subservient to His laws, each following a precise course for a set time. This points to His perfect planning and regulation of all universal matters. Allah presents these clear signs in detail so that people may become certain about the reality of returning to Him for accountability after this life.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي مَدَّ الْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِيَ وَأَنْهَارًا ۖ وَمِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ جَعَلَ فِيهَا زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ ۖ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand!","commentary":"Continuing from the description of the heavens and celestial bodies in Verse 2, this verse moves to signs on Earth, creating a panoramic view of creation. It states that Allah is the One who spread out the earth, making it vast and habitable. He placed firm mountains on it for stability and created flowing rivers. The verse also highlights the creation of all types of fruits in pairs (male and female), a scientific fact now known but miraculous at the time of revelation. Finally, it mentions the regular cycle of night covering the day. These diverse natural phenomena are presented as clear signs for people who pause and reflect deeply on creation.","arabic":"وَفِي الْأَرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُتَجَاوِرَاتٌ وَجَنَّاتٌ مِنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَانٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ يُسْقَىٰ بِمَاءٍ وَاحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي الْأُكُلِ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: \"When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?\" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)!","commentary":"This verse provides further detail about the signs on Earth, building on the previous verse's general description. It points out that even in adjoining areas of land, there are diverse types of soil and terrain. It highlights the variety of vegetation, like vineyards, grain fields, and date palms (which can grow from single or multiple stems). All are irrigated by the same water source and grow from the same earth, yet they produce fruits or crops that differ in taste and quality. This striking diversity from common elements is presented as a sign for those who use their intellect and reason to understand the power and wisdom of the Creator.","arabic":"وَإِنْ تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَإِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ الْأَغْلَالُ فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict in punishment.","commentary":"Following the verses presenting overwhelming signs of creation in the universe and on Earth (Verses 2-4), this verse expresses amazement at the disbelief of some people, particularly their denial of resurrection. It highlights how strange it is that after witnessing Allah's power in originating creation, they question whether they can be brought back to life after turning to dust. Such denial of resurrection is fundamentally a denial of their Lord, Allah. The verse grimly describes their state in the hereafter as being bound with \"yokes\" and destined to be inhabitants of the Fire, emphasizing the severe consequence of denying Allah and the truth.","arabic":"وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَاتُ ۗ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ ظُلْمِهِمْ ۖ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"6","text":"And the Unbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.","commentary":"Building on the disbelief mentioned in Verse 5, this verse points to their audacity in asking for Allah's punishment to be hastened upon them, rather than seeking guidance and good. It reminds them that severe punishments have already occurred to past communities who behaved similarly, serving as warnings. Despite their wrongdoing and challenging attitude, the verse beautifully highlights Allah's immense forgiveness for people. However, it immediately balances this by stating that Allah is also indeed strict in punishment for those who persist in their denial and wrongdoing and do not seek forgiveness. This contrast between His mercy and justice serves as both encouragement and warning.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۗ إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ مُنْذِرٌ ۖ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion.","commentary":"In continuation of the theme of disbelief and the demanding attitude of some people (seen in Verses 5 and 6), this verse addresses their demand for a specific miraculous \"sign\" to be sent down to Prophet Muhammad from Allah. The verse clarifies Prophet Muhammad's role: he is primarily a warner, someone who advises and cautions people about the consequences of their actions, and a guide, someone sent to show the right path. It explains that the sending of specific miracles is entirely within Allah's discretion, not the Prophet's, and that every community throughout history was sent a guide to convey Allah's message, just as Prophet Muhammad was sent to his people.","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنْثَىٰ وَمَا تَغِيضُ الْأَرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ ۖ وَكُلُّ شَيْءٍ عِنْدَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ"},{"verse":"8","text":"He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High.","commentary":"Transitioning from the external signs in the universe and the discussions about disbelief, this verse introduces the depth of Allah's knowledge, starting with something as intricate and hidden as what is in every womb. It states that Allah has complete knowledge of what every female is carrying, including any variations in gestation time or the number of offspring. This intimate knowledge demonstrates that absolutely everything, no matter how hidden or complex, is known to Allah and is precisely measured and proportioned in His sight. This illustrates His absolute control and detailed awareness, contrasting with the limited perception of humans who demand signs.","arabic":"عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ"},{"verse":"9","text":"It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day.","commentary":"Following the specific example of His detailed knowledge in Verse 8 (what is in wombs), this verse expands on Allah's boundless knowledge. It declares that Allah knows all that is unseen by humans and all that is open and visible. Nothing is hidden from Him. It concludes by emphasizing His ultimate attributes: He is \"the Great,\" beyond human comprehension in His power and majesty, and \"the Most High,\" meaning He is above all creation and has absolute supremacy. These attributes reinforce the idea of His complete knowledge and control, making the demand for specific signs (Verse 7) seem trivial given the overwhelming signs already present and His infinite nature.","arabic":"سَوَاءٌ مِنْكُمْ مَنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِاللَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ"},{"verse":"10","text":"For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people's lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah willeth a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of Allah's all-encompassing knowledge from Verses 8 and 9, this verse specifically addresses human actions and intentions. It clarifies that it makes no difference to Allah whether someone speaks privately and secretly or speaks openly and publicly. Similarly, it makes no difference to Him whether a person tries to hide or act concealed under the cover of night or walks about freely and openly during the day. Allah's knowledge is complete and absolute; He is fully aware of every thought, word, and action, regardless of when or where it occurs. This serves as a reminder that humans are constantly within the scope of Allah's knowledge, whether they acknowledge it or not.\n\n---","arabic":"لَهُ مُعَقِّبَاتٌ مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ ۗ وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِهِ مِنْ وَالٍ"},{"verse":"11","text":"It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain!","commentary":"This verse tells us about the unseen protection that surrounds each person. By Allah's command, there are angels who are continuously with a person, watching over them. Following this, the verse explains a fundamental principle: Allah does not change the condition of a people – whether it is a state of grace and prosperity or hardship and difficulty – until they change their inner state, their actions, and their hearts. This emphasizes human responsibility for their circumstances. However, it concludes with a solemn warning: if Allah decides to send punishment upon a people, based on their actions and rejection of guidance, there is no one who can turn it back or offer protection besides Him. This connects to the previous verses by highlighting Allah's absolute knowledge and control, both in the unseen realm of angels and in the consequences of human choices.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي يُرِيكُمُ الْبَرْقَ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا وَيُنْشِئُ السَّحَابَ الثِّقَالَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will.. yet these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with the strength of His power (supreme)!","commentary":"Transitioning from the theme of Allah's knowledge and control over individuals and communities, these verses now highlight His power and wisdom displayed in the natural world. This verse points to the phenomenon of lightning, which Allah causes us to see. Lightning can inspire both fear, perhaps of thunderbolts or destructive storms, and hope, as it often heralds rain that brings life to the earth. It is also Allah who brings forth the heavy clouds, laden with water that fertilizes the land when it falls as rain. This shows Allah's power in controlling nature and providing the means for life, setting the stage for further signs of His power and authority.","arabic":"وَيُسَبِّحُ الرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ الصَّوَاعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَهُمْ يُجَادِلُونَ فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ الْمِحَالِ"},{"verse":"13","text":"For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile) wandering (in the mind).","commentary":"Continuing the description of natural phenomena from the previous verse, this verse adds thunder to the scene. It tells us that even thunder, with its mighty sound, glorifies and praises Allah, as do the angels, out of awe for Him. This highlights the submission of all creation to Allah's will. The verse also mentions thunderbolts, which Allah directs to strike whom He wills. In the midst of these powerful manifestations of Allah's might and the universal glorification of Him, the verse points out the audacity of people who still argue and dispute about Allah, despite witnessing such overwhelming signs of His supreme power. This contrast emphasizes the misguided nature of their denial.","arabic":"لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُمْ بِشَيْءٍ إِلَّا كَبَاسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ إِلَى الْمَاءِ لِيَبْلُغَ فَاهُ وَمَا هُوَ بِبَالِغِهِ ۚ وَمَا دُعَاءُ الْكَافِرِينَ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to Allah (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings.","commentary":"Following the display of Allah's power in nature and the denouncement of those who dispute Him, this verse clarifies the proper object of prayer and supplication. It declares that sincere and true prayer belongs only to Allah, as He alone has the power to hear and respond. Those whom people call upon or worship besides Allah cannot respond to them at all. The verse illustrates this futility with a vivid image: someone desperately thirsty stretching their hands towards water, hoping it will reach their mouth, but it never does. This highlights the complete uselessness of praying to anything other than Allah, stating that the prayer of those who reject faith is like a futile, aimless wandering, achieving nothing.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَظِلَالُهُمْ بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ ۩"},{"verse":"15","text":"Say: \"Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"(It is) Allah.\" Say: \"Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?\" Say: \"Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?\" Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: \"Allah is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible.\"","commentary":"This verse reinforces the message of Allah's sole authority, contrasting with the misguided prayers mentioned in the previous verse. It states that everything in the heavens and on earth, every being, willingly or unwillingly, submits to Allah's will. This submission is symbolized by \"prostration,\" which is the ultimate act of humility and acknowledgment of Allah's greatness. Even their shadows prostrate to Allah, morning and evening, changing direction as the sun moves, demonstrating their inherent submission to the laws of the universe established by Allah. This emphasizes that the entire creation, in its natural state, testifies to Allah's power and sovereignty, making the denial or worship of others by humans particularly stark.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ رَبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ قُلِ اللَّهُ ۚ قُلْ أَفَاتَّخَذْتُمْ مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ لِأَنْفُسِهِمْ نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا ۚ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الْأَعْمَىٰ وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِي الظُّلُمَاتُ وَالنُّورُ ۗ أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ"},{"verse":"16","text":"He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth Allah (by parables) show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth Allah set forth parables.","commentary":"Building upon the theme of universal submission to Allah, this verse poses rhetorical questions to those who associate partners with Him. It instructs the Prophet to ask: \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" The undeniable answer is Allah. Then it questions why they would choose protectors or objects of worship other than Him, when these beings have no power to benefit or harm even themselves, let alone others. It uses powerful comparisons: are the blind equal to those who see? Is darkness equal to light? These highlight the clear difference between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance. It further challenges them: have their alleged partners created anything comparable to Allah's creation, leading to confusion? The verse concludes by affirming Allah's absolute uniqueness and power: He is the Creator of all things, the One, the Supreme, and the Irresistible.","arabic":"أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا فَاحْتَمَلَ السَّيْلُ زَبَدًا رَابِيًا ۚ وَمِمَّا يُوقِدُونَ عَلَيْهِ فِي النَّارِ ابْتِغَاءَ حِلْيَةٍ أَوْ مَتَاعٍ زَبَدٌ مِثْلُهُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْحَقَّ وَالْبَاطِلَ ۚ فَأَمَّا الزَّبَدُ فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَاءً ۖ وَأَمَّا مَا يَنْفَعُ النَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery!","commentary":"This verse provides a powerful parable, illustrating the nature of truth and falsehood, connecting back to the contrast presented in the previous verses (light vs. darkness, seeing vs. blind, true prayer vs. futile prayer). It describes how Allah sends down rain, causing rivers and streams to flow according to their appointed measure. As the water flows strongly, it carries foam and debris that float on the surface. Similarly, when metals like gold or iron are heated to be refined or shaped, impurities or scum rise to the top. The verse explains that this is how Allah illustrates truth and falsehood: the foam or scum (falsehood) is temporary, fleeting, and useless, eventually disappearing. But the water or the pure metal (truth) remains, providing benefit to humanity. This demonstrates that while falsehood may appear prominent or noisy, it lacks substance, while truth endures and is beneficial.","arabic":"لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُوا لِرَبِّهِمُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ لَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَهُ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لَافْتَدَوْا بِهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ سُوءُ الْحِسَابِ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition;-","commentary":"Concluding the discussion that began with the signs of Allah's power and the contrast between truth and falsehood, this verse describes the ultimate outcome for two groups of people. It states that those who respond positively to their Lord – by believing, submitting, and obeying – will receive the ultimate good reward, which includes Paradise. In contrast, those who do not respond to Him, who reject His guidance and authority, will face a terrible reckoning. Their situation will be so dire that even if they possessed all the wealth and resources of the heavens and the earth, and twice as much, they would offer it all as a ransom to escape punishment, but it would be utterly useless. Their final abode will be Hell, described as a miserable resting place. This verse starkly contrasts the eternal destinies based on one's response to Allah, echoing the parable of truth and falsehood from the previous verse, where truth (responding to Allah) is what endures and benefits, while falsehood (not responding) leads to ultimate loss and suffering.","arabic":"أَفَمَنْ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَىٰ ۚ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Those who fulfil the covenant of Allah and fail not in their plighted word;","commentary":"This verse highlights a fundamental difference between those who understand and accept the divine message revealed to the Prophet, and those who do not. It compares knowing the truth of the revelation to having sight, and rejecting it to being blind. It's not speaking about physical sight, but a spiritual or intellectual inability to perceive truth. Only those who are truly insightful and use their understanding can grasp the depth and importance of this message and take heed from it. This verse sets up a contrast that continues into the following verses, distinguishing between those who are receptive to guidance and those who are not.\n\n---","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يَنْقُضُونَ الْمِيثَاقَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"Those who join together those things which Allah hath commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning;","commentary":"Following the previous verse which distinguishes those with understanding from the blind, this verse begins to describe the qualities of those who have understanding and accept the truth. They are characterized by fulfilling their commitments to Allah. This refers to the foundational commitment of believing in Allah and submitting to His will, which is inherent in human nature and renewed through divine messages. Keeping this primary covenant leads to honoring all other promises and agreements made with fellow human beings, as these are also obligations stemming from the relationship with Allah. This verse establishes the importance of trustworthiness and keeping promises as a core characteristic of a person with true understanding.\n\n---","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوءَ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"21","text":"Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,-","commentary":"Continuing the description of those with understanding, this verse lists more of their qualities. They unite what Allah has instructed to be united, which encompasses obedience to all His commands and maintaining connections that should exist, such as family ties and community bonds. They also live with a profound respect and reverence for Allah, being conscious of His presence and authority. This consciousness leads them to anticipate the Day of Judgment with a healthy fear of being held accountable for their actions. This awareness encourages them to live righteously and uphold their commitments, connecting their actions in this life with their outcome in the Hereafter, which is further detailed in the next verses.\n\n---","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَأَنْفَقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً وَيَدْرَءُونَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ السَّيِّئَةَ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ"},{"verse":"22","text":"Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation):","commentary":"This verse adds further characteristics of those who possess understanding. They show patience and steadfastness, enduring hardships or difficulties while their sole motivation is to please and seek the acceptance of Allah. Their connection with Allah is outwardly manifested through establishing regular prayers, which is a direct form of worship and communication with Him. They also share the provisions Allah has given them with others, doing so both privately (to maintain sincerity and dignity) and publicly (to encourage others). Furthermore, they confront negative actions or attitudes directed towards them by responding with kindness and good deeds, hoping to neutralize the negativity and promote good. Because of these noble qualities, the verse promises them a magnificent outcome: the ultimate and eternal dwelling place, setting the stage for the description of this home in the following verses.\n\n---","arabic":"جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ ۖ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ كُلِّ بَابٍ"},{"verse":"23","text":"\"Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home!\"","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the \"eternal home\" mentioned in the previous verse. It is described as Gardens filled with unending happiness and comfort. A beautiful aspect of this reward is the reunion with their loved ones – righteous parents, spouses, and children – who also earned this place. This emphasizes the importance of family bonds and the continuity of relationships in the life to come, provided each individual is righteous. The scene is further enriched by the presence of angels who welcome them through every entrance, signifying great honor and hospitality. This verse paints a vivid picture of the joyous reception awaiting those who lived righteously.\n\n---","arabic":"سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ ۚ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ"},{"verse":"24","text":"But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home!","commentary":"This verse continues the scene from the previous one, detailing the greeting received by the inhabitants of Paradise. The angels salute them, proclaiming \"Peace be upon you,\" a universal wish for well-being and security. This greeting specifically recognizes and honors their steadfastness and patience throughout their lives, which was mentioned as a key quality in Verse 22 (\"Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord\"). The angels' words highlight that their perseverance in faith, in fulfilling duties, and in facing challenges was the reason for attaining this wonderful destination. They are then told how truly excellent and blessed their final home is, affirming the immense reward for their righteous efforts.\n\n---","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يَنْقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ"},{"verse":"25","text":"Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter.","commentary":"In stark contrast to the description of the righteous and their reward in the preceding verses (19-24), this verse describes the fate of those who lack understanding and reject the truth. They are characterized by the opposite qualities: breaking their commitment to Allah after having made it, severing connections that Allah has commanded to be maintained (the opposite of joining things together as mentioned in Verse 21), and spreading corruption and disorder on Earth (the opposite of living righteously and promoting good as described in Verse 22). Because of these actions, they face Allah's disapproval and rejection (the curse) and are destined for a terrible home, which is the opposite of the perpetual bliss promised to the righteous. This verse effectively uses contrast to underscore the consequences of choosing a path away from divine guidance.\n\n---","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَقْدِرُ ۚ وَفَرِحُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَاعٌ"},{"verse":"26","text":"The Unbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say: \"Truly Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,-","commentary":"This verse touches on the material aspects of life, contrasting the perspective of those focused solely on this world with the perspective of those who believe. It states that Allah has complete control over the provision of sustenance, giving abundantly to whomever He wills and limiting it for whomever He wills, according to His wisdom. Those who are primarily focused on worldly life find joy in the material comforts and pleasures it offers. However, the verse points out that this worldly life, with all its transient pleasures, is insignificant when compared to the eternal life of the Hereafter. This serves as a reminder that focusing solely on material gain and temporary comfort distracts from the ultimate reality and the true, lasting reward promised in the next life, reinforcing the value of the \"eternal home\" described earlier for the righteous.\n\n---","arabic":"وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَهْدِي إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"\"Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.","commentary":"Transitioning from the theme of worldly focus, this verse addresses a demand often made by those who reject the message: asking for miraculous physical signs as a condition for belief. They ask why the Prophet has not been sent such a sign from Allah. The response explains that miraculous signs are not the primary way people are guided. It is Allah Who allows people to go astray, but this happens to those who *choose* to turn away from Him. Conversely, Allah guides to Himself those who actively *turn to Him* with a sincere desire for guidance. This highlights that guidance is fundamentally linked to a person's inner inclination and willingness to seek the truth and return to Allah. It is a matter of the heart's disposition, which leads into the theme of finding solace in the remembrance of Allah in the next verse.\n\n---","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ"},{"verse":"28","text":"\"For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of (final) return.\"","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's point that guidance comes to those who turn to Allah, this verse describes the state of true believers. They are characterized by their belief and the profound peace and contentment their hearts find in remembering Allah. This remembrance is not merely reciting words, but a constant awareness of Allah's presence, His love, His power, and His wisdom. This deep connection brings reassurance, security, and a sense of purpose that nothing else can provide. The verse strongly affirms that it is, indeed, in remembering Allah that hearts achieve true satisfaction and tranquility, contrasting with the unease and seeking of external validation (like demanding signs) experienced by those who are far from Him. This spiritual comfort is a direct result of turning to Allah, as mentioned in the preceding verse.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ طُوبَىٰ لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ"},{"verse":"29","text":"Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious! Say: \"He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!\"","commentary":"Following the description of hearts finding peace and reassurance in remembering Allah (Verse 28), this verse speaks about the outcome for those who truly believe and act rightly. It promises them immense happiness and a wonderful final destination. This happiness is great and unending, a reward for their faith and good deeds in this life, marking a beautiful place of return to Allah.","arabic":"كَذَٰلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِي أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِنْ قَبْلِهَا أُمَمٌ لِتَتْلُوَ عَلَيْهِمُ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِالرَّحْمَٰنِ ۚ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ"},{"verse":"30","text":"If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise.","commentary":"This verse addresses Prophet Muhammad, explaining that he was sent as a messenger to his community, just as messengers were sent to communities who lived and passed away before them. His purpose is to convey the revelation sent down to him by Allah. Despite some rejecting \"the Most Gracious\" (a name of Allah emphasizing His immense mercy), the Prophet is instructed to firmly declare that Allah is his Lord, the only deity worthy of worship, that he trusts entirely in Allah, and that he turns only to Him. This reinforces the message of Allah's oneness and the Prophet's reliance on Him, following from the promise of return to Allah in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الْأَرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَىٰ ۗ بَلْ لِلَّهِ الْأَمْرُ جَمِيعًا ۗ أَفَلَمْ يَيْأَسِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْ لَوْ يَشَاءُ اللَّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا ۗ وَلَا يَزَالُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا تُصِيبُهُمْ بِمَا صَنَعُوا قَارِعَةٌ أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِنْ دَارِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ وَعْدُ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital!","commentary":"This verse speaks about the profound power and impact of the Qur'an, suggesting that its effect is so mighty that it's as if it could move mountains, split the earth, or make the dead speak. However, it immediately clarifies that ultimate command and power belong solely to Allah. It then addresses the idea of guidance, stating that if Allah had willed, He could have compelled all of humanity to believe, but He has given humans the capacity for choice. It follows that those who deny the truth will continue to face difficulties and calamities due to their actions, potentially affecting them directly or those around them, until Allah's promised judgment arrives, which Allah assures will certainly come to pass. This follows the mention of the Prophet reciting the revelation in the previous verse, highlighting the significance and power of that revelation.","arabic":"وَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَأَمْلَيْتُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ ۖ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ"},{"verse":"32","text":"Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: \"But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?\" Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide.","commentary":"This verse offers perspective to Prophet Muhammad and the believers, reminding them that the mockery and rejection they face are not unprecedented. Many messengers before him were also ridiculed and denied. Allah states that He gave those deniers time and respite, but eventually, His punishment came upon them, and He asks rhetorically how terrible that consequence was. This serves as both reassurance to the Prophet and a warning about the eventual fate of those who deny Allah's messengers and message, continuing the theme of consequences for unbelief mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ ۗ وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ قُلْ سَمُّوهُمْ ۚ أَمْ تُنَبِّئُونَهُ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ بِظَاهِرٍ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ ۗ بَلْ زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مَكْرُهُمْ وَصُدُّوا عَنِ السَّبِيلِ ۗ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ"},{"verse":"33","text":"For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter: and defender have they none against Allah.","commentary":"Building on the consequences of denial, this verse challenges the idea of associating partners with Allah. It asks whether anything that is watched over and known completely by Allah could possibly be considered His equal or partner. It sarcastically challenges those who associate partners to name them, questioning if they know something on Earth unknown to Allah or if their claims are just empty words. The verse explains that those who don't believe are deceived by their own misguided thoughts, which appear appealing to them, preventing them from finding the right path. It states that if Allah allows someone to go astray based on their own rejection and choices, no one can guide them.","arabic":"لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَلَعَذَابُ الْآخِرَةِ أَشَقُّ ۖ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَاقٍ"},{"verse":"34","text":"The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.","commentary":"This verse explicitly states the consequences for those who deny the truth and associate partners with Allah, building on the challenge posed in the previous verse. It declares that they will face punishment in this life, but the punishment in the afterlife will be much more severe. It emphasizes that against Allah's judgment, they will find no one to protect or defend them. This sets a strong contrast with the blessed state of the righteous described in the following verse.","arabic":"مَثَلُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي وُعِدَ الْمُتَّقُونَ ۖ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ أُكُلُهَا دَائِمٌ وَظِلُّهَا ۚ تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا ۖ وَعُقْبَى الْكَافِرِينَ النَّارُ"},{"verse":"35","text":"Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: \"I am commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return.\"","commentary":"Following the description of the severe consequences for deniers in the previous verse, this verse presents a contrasting vision of paradise, promised to the righteous (those who are mindful of Allah). It is described as a beautiful garden with rivers flowing beneath, offering unending enjoyment and perpetual shade. This illustrates the ultimate destiny of those who follow Allah's guidance, highlighting the vast difference between their end and the fate of those who deny the truth, whose end is stated here as the Fire.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ وَمِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ مَنْ يُنْكِرُ بَعْضَهُ ۚ قُلْ إِنَّمَا أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ وَلَا أُشْرِكَ بِهِ ۚ إِلَيْهِ أَدْعُو وَإِلَيْهِ مَآبِ"},{"verse":"36","text":"Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against Allah.","commentary":"This verse addresses the reactions of those who had received earlier divine revelations (the People of the Book) to the Qur'an revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Some among them, recognizing the truth, welcome and rejoice in what has been revealed. However, others, from different groups or factions, reject parts of the revelation. In response, Prophet Muhammad is instructed to clearly state his fundamental mission: he is commanded to worship Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him. He calls people to Allah, and ultimately, everyone will return to Allah. This reinforces the core message of Allah's oneness and the Prophet's dedication to it, linking back to the concept of Allah as the ultimate destination mentioned in earlier verses (e.g., 30).","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ حُكْمًا عَرَبِيًّا ۚ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ بَعْدَمَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا وَاقٍ"},{"verse":"37","text":"We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed).","commentary":"This verse clarifies the status and importance of the Qur'an, stating that Allah has revealed it as a decisive authority and standard of judgment, conveyed in the Arabic language. It delivers a strong warning, initially addressed to the Prophet (and implicitly to all believers), that if one were to follow the varying desires or opinions of those who reject the revelation, after having received such clear truth and knowledge, they would find no one to protect or defend them from Allah's judgment. This emphasizes the completeness and finality of the Qur'anic guidance and the importance of adhering strictly to it, building upon the statement in the previous verse about declaring the core message of worshipping Allah alone.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ أَزْوَاجًا وَذُرِّيَّةً ۚ وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِآيَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۗ لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ"},{"verse":"38","text":"Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book.","commentary":"This verse addresses potential questions or objections regarding Prophet Muhammad's human nature and the absence of certain miracles. It confirms that messengers sent before him were also human beings who had families (wives and children). It also clarifies that messengers do not produce miraculous signs on their own initiative but only when and how Allah permits according to His wisdom. It adds that Allah sent a book or revelation suitable for each period, implying that the Qur'an is the revelation for the Prophet Muhammad's time. This provides context for understanding the role and limitations of a messenger, connecting to earlier discussions about miracles (Verse 31) and the nature of the message.","arabic":"يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ ۖ وَعِنْدَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ"},{"verse":"39","text":"Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part of what we promised them or take to ourselves thy soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to make (the Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account.","commentary":"This verse speaks about Allah's absolute power and authority over all things, including divine revelations and the destinies of individuals and nations. It explains that Allah can alter or uphold decrees and messages according to His will and wisdom. The phrase \"Mother of the Book\" refers to the ultimate source of all divine knowledge and decrees with Allah. This follows from the previous verse (38) which mentioned that every age had its own revelation, clarifying that these were all part of Allah's plan and His ultimate control over divine guidance throughout history.","arabic":"وَإِنْ مَا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ الَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَاغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ"},{"verse":"40","text":"See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? (Where) Allah commands, there is none to put back His Command: and He is swift in calling to account.","commentary":"This verse reassures Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and clarifies his role as a messenger. It explains that whether he witnesses the fulfillment of Allah's promises (such as the consequences for those who deny the message) during his lifetime or passes away before they occur, his primary duty is simply to convey the message entrusted to him. The outcome and holding people accountable for their choices are matters that rest solely with Allah. This highlights the Prophet's human role as a conveyor and Allah's divine role as the ultimate judge and controller of events, reinforcing the concept of Allah's power mentioned in the preceding verse (39). This also sets the stage for observing Allah's power unfolding in the world, as described in the following verse (41).","arabic":"أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا نَأْتِي الْأَرْضَ نَنْقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ لَا مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"41","text":"Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the master-planning is Allah's He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the Unbelievers know who gets home in the end.","commentary":"This verse points to a visible sign in the world around the people who deny the message. It asks them if they observe how Allah causes the power and territories of nations to gradually diminish. This serves as a practical demonstration of Allah's might and control over worldly affairs and the consequences faced by communities who turn away from divine guidance. It emphasizes that when Allah's judgment or decree is issued, nothing can prevent or reverse it, and He is swift in settling accounts. This verse connects to the previous one (40) by showing how Allah, as the ultimate Reckoner, demonstrates His power and control over the world, including the fate of communities. It also leads into the next verse (42) by contrasting human plotting with Allah's supreme planning.","arabic":"وَقَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَلِلَّهِ الْمَكْرُ جَمِيعًا ۖ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ۗ وَسَيَعْلَمُ الْكُفَّارُ لِمَنْ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"The Unbelievers say: \"No messenger art thou.\" Say: \"Enough for a witness between me and you is Allah, and such as have knowledge of the Book.\"","commentary":"Following the depiction of Allah's power over lands and nations (41), this verse reminds the deniers that people before them also made plans and schemes. However, it asserts that Allah's planning is superior and encompasses everything. Allah has full knowledge of what every individual does. The verse concludes with a warning that those who deny the truth will eventually learn who achieves the favorable outcome in the end, implying that the ultimate success belongs to those who follow Allah's guidance. This highlights Allah's knowledge and control over human actions and their final consequences, linking it to the ultimate witness mentioned in the following verse (43).","arabic":"وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَسْتَ مُرْسَلًا ۚ قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ الْكِتَابِ"},{"verse":"43","text":"","commentary":"This verse addresses the core denial by those who refuse to accept Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a messenger from Allah. It instructs the Prophet to respond by stating that Allah Himself is sufficient as a witness to the truth of his message. Additionally, it mentions that those who possess true knowledge of previous divine scriptures also recognize the truth of the Qur'an and the Prophet's message, serving as a further confirmation. This verse serves as a powerful concluding statement in this section, relying on the ultimate authority of Allah's knowledge and witness, which was alluded to in the preceding verse (42) about Allah's knowledge of all doings. It firmly establishes the divine origin and truthfulness of the message despite human denial.","arabic":""}];
