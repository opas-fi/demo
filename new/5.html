    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"O ye who believe! fulfil (all) obligations. Lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals, with the exceptions named: But animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb: for Allah doth command according to His will and plan.","commentary":"This verse opens with a fundamental call to believers: to fulfill all their commitments and obligations. In the Islamic understanding, these commitments include those made to Allah, such as following His commands, as well as those made between people, like contracts and agreements. The verse then immediately addresses a specific practical matter: what types of four-footed animals are permissible for food. It states a general permission for all such animals, but notes that there will be specific exceptions mentioned later. It also adds a temporary restriction: hunting is forbidden when one is in a state of consecration for pilgrimage or within the sacred area around the Ka'bah in Mecca. This specific rule is presented as an example of Allah's absolute authority and wisdom in issuing commands as He wills. This instruction about fulfilling obligations sets the stage for the detailed laws and principles that follow in the Sura.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَوْفُوا بِالْعُقُودِ ۚ أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الْأَنْعَامِ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ غَيْرَ مُحِلِّي الصَّيْدِ وَأَنْتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ"},{"verse":"2","text":"O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the sacred house, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's theme of fulfilling obligations and respecting sacred boundaries, this verse elaborates on things that are considered sacred and must not be violated by believers. These include the symbols established by Allah (generally referring to the rites and signs associated with pilgrimage and the Sacred House), the sanctity of the sacred months (periods when fighting is forbidden), the animals designated for sacrifice (which should not be harmed or used for other purposes), the signs marking these animals (like garlands), and the safety of people coming to the Sacred House seeking blessings and Allah's pleasure. The verse reiterates that hunting is permissible *after* leaving the sacred state and area, linking back to the restriction in Verse 1. A crucial instruction is then given: even if others have treated you unjustly or hostilely (like preventing access to the Sacred Mosque), you must not let this hatred lead you to commit injustice or aggression. Believers are commanded to cooperate in furthering goodness and righteous conduct, but never in promoting sin or hostility. This emphasizes a high standard of justice and self-control, motivated by the reminder to fear Allah, who is severe in punishment for those who transgress.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُحِلُّوا شَعَائِرَ اللَّهِ وَلَا الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ وَلَا الْهَدْيَ وَلَا الْقَلَائِدَ وَلَا آمِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَانًا ۚ وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَادُوا ۚ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَنْ صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَنْ تَعْتَدُوا ۘ وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse provides a detailed list of specific types of meat that are forbidden for believers, expanding on the exceptions mentioned in Verse 1. It explicitly prohibits carrion (dead meat), blood, and the flesh of swine. It also forbids meat from animals over which a name other than Allah's was invoked at the time of slaughter. The list continues with animals that died from specific causes other than proper slaughter (strangulation, beating, falling, goring, or being killed by a wild animal), unless they are caught while still alive and properly slaughtered. Animals sacrificed on idolatrous altars are also forbidden. Finally, it prohibits the division of meat using a pre-Islamic practice involving raffling with arrows, calling it sinful.\n\nIn the middle of these dietary laws, a profound statement is revealed: \"This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\" Muslim belief holds this was one of the last verses revealed, signifying the completion of the Islamic message and law. It declares that those who oppose Islam have lost hope of defeating or altering it. Believers are told not to fear them but to fear Allah alone. The perfection of the religion, the completion of Allah's favor, and the choice of Islam as the way of life for believers are momentous declarations, implying that the faith and its laws are now complete and comprehensive for all time. The verse concludes with an exception for dire necessity: if someone is forced by extreme hunger to eat forbidden meat, with no intention of disobeying Allah, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. This highlights the compassion and flexibility within the law under unavoidable circumstances.","arabic":"حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ وَالدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَا أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُوا بِالْأَزْلَامِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ الْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِ ۚ الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ فِي مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"4","text":"They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by Allah: eat what they catch for you, but pronounce the name of Allah over it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account.","commentary":"This verse directly answers a question about what is permissible for believers to eat, following the detailed prohibitions in the previous verse. The general principle given is that \"all things good and pure\" are lawful. This establishes a broad permission for wholesome food. It then addresses a specific case related to hunting, which was restricted earlier (Verse 1). It clarifies that what is caught by trained hunting animals (like dogs or falcons) is permissible, provided the training aligns with what Allah has taught (referencing the ability to train animals as a blessing from Allah). Believers are instructed to eat from what their trained animals catch for them, but to remember to pronounce Allah's name over it (typically done when setting the animal to hunt). The verse concludes by reminding believers to fear Allah, as He is swift in reckoning. This links the practical matter of permissible food to the essential attitude of God-consciousness and accountability before Allah.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ ۖ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ ۙ وَمَا عَلَّمْتُمْ مِنَ الْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ فَكُلُوا مِمَّا أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"5","text":"This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time,- when ye give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues if any one rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).","commentary":"This verse continues the theme of what is made lawful for believers, expanding on the idea of \"good and pure\" things introduced in the previous verse. It specifically addresses interactions with the \"People of the Book\" (a term referring to followers of earlier revealed scriptures, particularly Jews and Christians). It states that their food is lawful for Muslims to eat, and Muslim food is lawful for them. This allows for social interaction and mutual hospitality. The verse then discusses marriage, stating that virtuous women from among the believers are lawful, as are virtuous women from among the People of the Book who received scriptures before the Qur'an. Conditions for such marriages are mentioned: giving the woman her due dower, entering into an honest wedlock, and avoiding unlawful sexual relationships or secret affairs. The verse concludes with a strong warning: anyone who rejects faith will find all their actions to be in vain, and in the Hereafter, they will be among the losers. This emphasizes that these regulations about food and marriage are integral parts of the faith, and rejecting them is a rejection of the faith itself. This warning serves as a significant concluding comment for this block of legal rulings related to daily life.","arabic":"الْيَوْمَ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ ۖ وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حِلٌّ لَكُمْ وَطَعَامُكُمْ حِلٌّ لَهُمْ ۖ وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ إِذَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ وَلَا مُتَّخِذِي أَخْدَانٍ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِالْإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful.","commentary":"Transitioning from discussions of food and marriage, this verse addresses an essential aspect of worship: purification before prayer. Believers are given clear instructions for performing ablution (Wudu') when preparing to pray: washing the face, arms up to the elbows, wiping the head with wet hands, and washing the feet up to the ankles. It also specifies that a full ritual bath is required if one is in a state of major ceremonial impurity. Recognizing that circumstances may prevent the use of water, the verse provides a concession: if one is ill, traveling, has relieved themselves, or had intimate contact, and cannot find water or using water would be harmful, then dry ablution (Tayammum) is permissible. This involves using clean earth or sand to lightly wipe the face and hands. The verse explains the wisdom behind these rules: Allah does not intend to burden believers or cause difficulty, but rather to purify them and complete His favor upon them, so that they may be grateful. This highlights the practicality, mercy, and spiritual purpose behind Islamic regulations, reinforcing that they are for the believers' benefit and part of Allah's blessing.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ ۚ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ جُنُبًا فَاطَّهَّرُوا ۚ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ مَرْضَىٰ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاءَ أَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنَ الْغَائِطِ أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُوا مَاءً فَتَيَمَّمُوا صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَامْسَحُوا بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ مِنْهُ ۚ مَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ حَرَجٍ وَلَٰكِنْ يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهِّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"And call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you, and His covenant, which He ratified with you, when ye said: \"We hear and we obey\": And fear Allah, for Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.","commentary":"Following the practical instructions on purification and prayer in the previous verse, this verse calls believers to reflect on the deeper spiritual context of their faith. It reminds them to remember Allah's favor bestowed upon them (by choosing Islam as their religion, as mentioned in Verse 3) and the covenant they made with Him. This covenant is described as the commitment believers made when they affirmed, \"We hear and we obey.\" This phrase signifies their acceptance of Allah's commands and their pledge to follow them. The verse urges believers to fear Allah (to be God-conscious), reinforcing that Allah has full knowledge of their innermost thoughts and intentions. This reminder connects the outward practice of religious duties with the inward state of the heart, emphasizing sincerity and awareness of Allah's omnipresence.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَاقَهُ الَّذِي وَاثَقَكُمْ بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ"},{"verse":"8","text":"O ye who believe! stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.","commentary":"This verse builds upon the call to remember Allah's covenant and to fear Him (Verse 7), emphasizing a crucial ethical obligation. Believers are commanded to be steadfast in their commitment to Allah and to stand firmly as witnesses for justice and fair dealing. This is a demanding standard, requiring impartiality even when dealing with those one dislikes. The verse specifically instructs believers not to let their hatred for others lead them to commit injustice. It firmly states, \"Be just,\" and highlights this as a quality very close to piety (Taqwa), which was mentioned in Verse 7. The reminder to fear Allah is repeated, along with the assurance that Allah is fully aware of everything they do. This underscores that the commitment to justice is a religious duty performed for the sake of Allah, who sees and knows all actions and intentions, even in the most challenging circumstances involving adversaries. This command echoes and strengthens the principle mentioned in Verse 2 about not letting hatred lead to aggression.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا ۚ اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness hath Allah promised forgiveness and a great reward.","commentary":"This verse follows the command for believers to uphold justice and piety (Verse 8) by stating the outcome for those who live by their faith. It promises forgiveness for sins and a significant reward from Allah to those who believe in Him and perform righteous deeds. This serves as encouragement and motivation for believers to strive in fulfilling their obligations, upholding justice, and fearing Allah, assuring them that their efforts and sincerity will be recognized and generously compensated by Allah. It provides the positive consequence for adhering to the principles and laws outlined in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ ۙ لَهُمْ مَغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire.","commentary":"In direct contrast to the promise for believers in Verse 9, this verse describes the fate of those who reject faith and deny Allah's signs (which include the verses of the Qur'an and the evidence of creation). It states that they will be the companions of Hell-fire. This serves as a stern warning and highlights the ultimate consequence of rejecting the divine guidance and failing to fulfill the covenant with Allah. By presenting these two contrasting outcomes, the verses emphasize the critical importance of choosing faith and righteous action, reinforcing the call to fulfill obligations and fear Allah mentioned earlier in the passage.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ"},{"verse":"11","text":"O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you when certain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you, but (Allah) held back their hands from you: so fear Allah. And on Allah let believers put (all) their trust.","commentary":"This verse calls upon those who believe to remember a specific instance of Allah's favor. It reminds them of a time when enemies intended to harm them, reaching out to attack, but Allah prevented this aggression and protected the believers. This act of divine protection is presented as a significant blessing to be recalled and appreciated.\n\nComing after verses that discussed the consequences of belief and disbelief (Verse 9-10), this verse reinforces the importance of faith by highlighting Allah's active care for those who believe.\n\nThe verse then concludes with two commands: to fear Allah and to place complete trust in Allah. Remembering Allah's protection in the past should strengthen the believers' reverence for Him and deepen their reliance on Him, rather than fearing their enemies. This trust in Allah is a core aspect of faith, providing reassurance and motivation to uphold the principles and commands mentioned earlier in the surah, including dealing justly even with those who have been hostile.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَنْ يَبْسُطُوا إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنْكُمْ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we appointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: \"I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers, practise regular charity, believe in my messengers, honour and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude.\"","commentary":"This verse speaks about a solemn commitment, or covenant, that Allah made with the Israelite community long ago. It mentions that Allah appointed twelve leaders from among them to represent their twelve tribes. Allah gave them a promise: \"I am with you.\" This meant they would have Allah's support and guidance, a truly great blessing. However, this promise was conditional. The covenant required them to fulfill certain duties: performing their devotional prayers regularly, giving a portion of their wealth as charity (similar to *zakat* in Islam, which supports the community and those in need), believing in all of Allah's messengers without exception, supporting these messengers in their mission, and spending generously to support Allah's cause, which is described as a \"beautiful loan\" to Allah Himself. In return for fulfilling these conditions, Allah promised to forgive their shortcomings and admit them to Paradise. The verse concludes with a clear warning: anyone who fails to uphold this faith and commitment after entering into this covenant will have clearly strayed from the right path.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ وَبَعَثْنَا مِنْهُمُ اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ نَقِيبًا ۖ وَقَالَ اللَّهُ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ ۖ لَئِنْ أَقَمْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَيْتُمُ الزَّكَاةَ وَآمَنْتُمْ بِرُسُلِي وَعَزَّرْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَقْرَضْتُمُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا لَأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَلَأُدْخِلَنَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ فَمَنْ كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"13","text":"But because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them, nor wilt thou cease to find them- barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind.","commentary":"Following on from the covenant mentioned in the previous verse, this verse describes the consequences for the Israelites when they broke that covenant. Allah states that, as a result of their failure to uphold their commitment, they experienced divine rejection and their hearts became unreceptive to further guidance. The commentary explains that this led to their altering the meaning of the scriptures revealed to them and neglecting significant parts of the divine message they were meant to preserve and follow. While the verse notes that most of them exhibited persistent negative behavior and deceit, it also mentions that there were exceptions, \"barring a few.\" Despite this, Allah instructed the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) at that time to forgive them and overlook their misdeeds, emphasizing that Allah loves those who show kindness.","arabic":"فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِمْ مِيثَاقَهُمْ لَعَنَّاهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا قُلُوبَهُمْ قَاسِيَةً ۖ يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَنْ مَوَاضِعِهِ ۙ وَنَسُوا حَظًّا مِمَّا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ ۚ وَلَا تَزَالُ تَطَّلِعُ عَلَىٰ خَائِنَةٍ مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ ۖ فَاعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَاصْفَحْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.","commentary":"Similar to the Israelites, this verse states that Allah also made a covenant with those who identified as Christians. However, the verse says that they, too, neglected or differed on important aspects of the divine message they received. This failure to fully uphold their covenant, particularly regarding the core principle of Allah's absolute oneness, led to internal divisions among them. As a consequence, Allah allowed enmity and hatred to develop among different Christian groups and denominations, which the verse says will continue until the Day of Judgment. This internal discord is presented as a consequence of their departure from the original message. The verse concludes by stating that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will make clear to them the full extent of their actions. This verse connects to the previous one by showing a similar pattern of a community receiving a divine covenant, neglecting parts of it, and facing consequences, although the specific consequences differ (internal division versus hardened hearts and external treachery).","arabic":"وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّا نَصَارَىٰ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَهُمْ فَنَسُوا حَظًّا مِمَّا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ فَأَغْرَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ وَسَوْفَ يُنَبِّئُهُمُ اللَّهُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَصْنَعُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"O people of the Book! There hath come to you our Messenger, revealing to you much that ye used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There hath come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book, -","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the \"People of the Book\" (a term used in the Qur'an for Jews and Christians), announcing the arrival of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as Allah's final Messenger to them and all of humanity. The commentary explains that this Messenger has come to clarify much of what they had kept hidden from their scriptures and to set aside aspects that were specific to previous eras or communities and are no longer necessary in the final message. The arrival of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is described as bringing a \"light\" and a \"clear Book\" (the Qur'an) from Allah. This highlights the purpose of the new revelation – to bring clarity, truth, and complete guidance, especially following the periods of deviation described in the previous verses regarding the covenants of earlier communities. It presents the Qur'an as a new source of divine guidance available to them.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِمَّا كُنْتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُو عَنْ كَثِيرٍ ۚ قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Wherewith Allah guideth all who seek His good pleasure to ways of peace and safety, and leadeth them out of darkness, by His will, unto the light,- guideth them to a path that is straight.","commentary":"This verse describes the profound impact and purpose of the \"light and clear Book\" introduced in the previous verse. It explains that through this divine guidance (the Qur'an and the message of Prophet Muhammad), Allah leads those who sincerely seek His approval and pleasure. This guidance directs them to paths of peace and security, both internally within the individual and externally within society. The verse beautifully contrasts \"darkness\" with \"light,\" explaining that Allah's guidance brings people out of confusion, ignorance, and moral uncertainty into clarity, truth, and understanding. Ultimately, this message leads them to a path that is straight and correct, aligned with human nature and the divine will. This verse details the positive outcomes of embracing the guidance offered in verse 15.","arabic":"يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ السَّلَامِ وَيُخْرِجُهُمْ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"17","text":"In blasphemy indeed are those that say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary.

For to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between. He createth what He pleaseth. For Allah hath power over all things.\"","commentary":"This verse clarifies a core belief in Islam regarding the nature of Allah, addressing claims that arose within Christianity. From an Islamic perspective, asserting that Allah is Prophet Jesus, the son of Mary, is considered a grave statement because it equates a created being, even a revered prophet, with the Creator. The commentary explains that Islam maintains a clear and absolute distinction between Allah and His creation. The verse challenges this idea by asking who could possibly prevent Allah if He willed to cause Prophet Jesus, his mother, Mary, or indeed everyone on Earth to perish. This question highlights Allah's absolute power and sovereignty over all creation. The verse concludes by emphasizing that the dominion of everything in the heavens and Earth belongs solely to Allah; He creates whatever He wills and has power over all things. This serves as a fundamental reminder of Allah's unique and unparalleled nature, essential for understanding Islamic monotheism.","arabic":"لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۚ قُلْ فَمَنْ يَمْلِكُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا إِنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ الْمَسِيحَ ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ۗ وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۚ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"18","text":"(Both) the Jews and the Christians say: \"We are sons of Allah, and his beloved.\" Say: \"Why then doth He punish you for your sins?

The verse refutes this by pointing out that if they were truly uniquely beloved in a way that exempted them, Allah would not punish them for their sins. It clarifies that they are simply human beings, part of Allah's creation, just like everyone else. Forgiveness and punishment are entirely within Allah's power and discretion, applied justly based on His will, not based on a claim of special status. The verse reiterates, as in verse 17, that the dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone, and everyone will ultimately return to Him. This reinforces the principle of universal accountability and Allah's absolute authority over all.","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ نَحْنُ أَبْنَاءُ اللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّاؤُهُ ۚ قُلْ فَلِمَ يُعَذِّبُكُمْ بِذُنُوبِكُمْ ۖ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ بَشَرٌ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ ۚ يَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ وَإِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"19","text":"O People of the Book!

And Allah hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse returns to the address to the \"People of the Book,\" reinforcing the message of verse 15 about the arrival of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It emphasizes that his coming occurs after a period where there was no new messenger, ensuring that they have no excuse to claim ignorance of Allah's guidance or accountability. The Messenger's role is explicitly stated as making things clear to them, bringing both \"glad tidings\" (good news for those who believe and obey) and a \"warner\" (warning against deviation and its consequences). This arrival removes any argument that they were left without guidance or warning. The verse concludes by stating that Allah has power over all things, a reminder of His ability to send messengers, hold people accountable, and enforce His will. This verse reinforces the importance and timing of the final message delivered by Prophet Muhammad.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَىٰ فَتْرَةٍ مِنَ الرُّسُلِ أَنْ تَقُولُوا مَا جَاءَنَا مِنْ بَشِيرٍ وَلَا نَذِيرٍ ۖ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"20","text":"Remember Moses said to his people: \"O my people! Call in remembrance the favour of Allah unto you, when He produced prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples.","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to a historical example from the story of the Israelites, recounted by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). Prophet Moses reminds his people to recall and appreciate the immense blessings Allah had bestowed upon them. He specifically highlights three major favors: Allah raising prophets from among their community, granting them kingship and authority, and giving them unique blessings that had not been given to other nations at that time. This serves as a preamble to the command that follows, emphasizing the magnitude of divine grace they had received, which should motivate them to obedience. The commentary notes that Prophet Moses seems to express some apprehension here, having dealt with their behavior before, leading him to preface his command with this powerful reminder of Allah's favors.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَعَلَ فِيكُمْ أَنْبِيَاءَ وَجَعَلَكُمْ مُلُوكًا وَآتَاكُمْ مَا لَمْ يُؤْتِ أَحَدًا مِنَ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"\"O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin.\"","commentary":"Following the reminder of Allah's favors in the previous verse, Prophet Moses delivers a direct command to the Israelites. He instructs them to enter a specific territory, referred to as the \"holy land,\" which Allah had designated for them. This was a land they were promised to inherit. Prophet Moses urges them not to turn away out of fear or cowardice, warning them that doing so would lead to their downfall and ruin. This command represents a critical test of their faith and obedience following the immense blessings they had received. The commentary highlights Prophet Moses's concern, knowing their past tendency towards disobedience, and points out the seriousness of the command and the dire consequences of failing to heed it. This verse sets the stage for the Israelites' response, which is described in the subsequent verses, illustrating their failure to live up to the divine command despite receiving countless favors.","arabic":"يَا قَوْمِ ادْخُلُوا الْأَرْضَ الْمُقَدَّسَةَ الَّتِي كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَرْتَدُّوا عَلَىٰ أَدْبَارِكُمْ فَتَنْقَلِبُوا خَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"They said: \"O Moses! In this land are a people of exceeding strength: Never shall we enter it until they leave it: if (once) they leave, then shall we enter.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the story of Prophet Moses and his people as they approached a land that Allah had designated for them. Prophet Moses had reminded them of Allah's favors and commanded them to enter this holy land (as mentioned in the preceding verses). However, in this verse, his people respond with fear and hesitation. They point out that the land is inhabited by a very strong people and declare that they will not enter it until these inhabitants leave. Their response shows a lack of trust in Allah's promise and a reluctance to face difficulty or fight for the land.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنَّ فِيهَا قَوْمًا جَبَّارِينَ وَإِنَّا لَنْ نَدْخُلَهَا حَتَّىٰ يَخْرُجُوا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ يَخْرُجُوا مِنْهَا فَإِنَّا دَاخِلُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"(But) among (their) Allah-fearing men were two on whom Allah had bestowed His grace: They said: \"Assault them at the (proper) Gate: when once ye are in, victory will be yours; But on Allah put your trust if ye have faith.\"","commentary":"Following the fearful response of the majority, this verse highlights a different attitude held by two men among Prophet Moses' people. These two men, described as fearing Allah and having received His grace, stepped forward with courage and faith. They advised the people to trust in Allah and to take decisive action by entering the city through its gate. They assured them that once they entered, victory would be theirs, emphasizing that placing trust in Allah is essential for true believers, especially when facing challenges. Their words stand in stark contrast to the fear and unwillingness shown in the previous verse, offering a pathway based on courage and reliance on divine support.","arabic":"قَالَ رَجُلَانِ مِنَ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمَا ادْخُلُوا عَلَيْهِمُ الْبَابَ فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمُوهُ فَإِنَّكُمْ غَالِبُونَ ۚ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"They said: \"O Moses! while they remain there, never shall we be able to enter, to the end of time. Go thou, and thy Lord, and fight ye two, while we sit here (and watch).\"","commentary":"Despite the encouragement and reminder of trusting in Allah from the two men, the majority of Prophet Moses' people persisted in their refusal, as described in this verse. They re-emphasized their unwavering decision not to enter the land as long as the strong inhabitants were there. Their reply becomes more defiant and disrespectful, telling Prophet Moses to go with his Lord and fight, while they would stay put. This extreme reluctance to participate in the task assigned to them by Allah, coupled with their dismissive attitude towards Prophet Moses, reveals a deep-seated unwillingness to fulfill the command and a lack of faith in divine assistance. This verse demonstrates the people's complete abandonment of responsibility.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنَّا لَنْ نَدْخُلَهَا أَبَدًا مَا دَامُوا فِيهَا ۖ فَاذْهَبْ أَنْتَ وَرَبُّكَ فَقَاتِلَا إِنَّا هَاهُنَا قَاعِدُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"He said: \"O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: so separate us from this rebellious people!\"","commentary":"In response to his people's blatant disobedience and refusal to enter the land, Prophet Moses turns to Allah in this verse. Overwhelmed by their rebellion after all that Allah had done for them through him, Prophet Moses expresses his profound disappointment and helplessness regarding their behavior. He states that he only has control over himself and his brother (Prophet Aaron) and asks Allah to separate him and his brother from this disobedient community. This prayer reflects Prophet Moses' frustration and his reliance on Allah to deal with the people who had broken their commitment and refused to follow His command.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لَا أَمْلِكُ إِلَّا نَفْسِي وَأَخِي ۖ فَافْرُقْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Allah said: \"Therefore will the land be out of their reach for forty years: In distraction will they wander through the land: But sorrow thou not over these rebellious people.","commentary":"This verse presents Allah's response to Prophet Moses' prayer and His judgment upon the disobedient people. As a consequence of their refusal to enter the land and their rebellion, Allah declared that the promised land would be forbidden to that generation for forty years. During this time, they would wander aimlessly in the desert. This punishment was a direct result of their lack of faith and obedience. Allah also instructed Prophet Moses not to grieve over the fate of these rebellious people, signifying that their consequence was a just recompense for their actions and a lesson for others.","arabic":"قَالَ فَإِنَّهَا مُحَرَّمَةٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ۛ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً ۛ يَتِيهُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ فَلَا تَأْسَ عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: \"Be sure I will slay thee.\" \"Surely,\" said the former, \"Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous.","commentary":"We are told here to recount the true story of the two sons of Prophet Adam, the first human. This story highlights fundamental aspects of human nature – the capacity for both good and evil. It begins by describing a situation where both sons offered sacrifices to Allah. Allah accepted the sacrifice of one but not the other. The verse doesn't explain why one was accepted and the other wasn't, except through the words of the righteous son: \"Allah accepts only from those who are righteous.\" This implies the acceptance was based on the inner state or intention of the person offering, not just the offering itself. The reaction of the son whose sacrifice was not accepted was one of intense anger and envy, leading him to threaten his brother. This immediately sets a stark contrast between goodness and the beginnings of crime, preparing the listener for the severe nature of the actions that follow.","arabic":"وَاتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ابْنَيْ آدَمَ بِالْحَقِّ إِذْ قَرَّبَا قُرْبَانًا فَتُقُبِّلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِمَا وَلَمْ يُتَقَبَّلْ مِنَ الْآخَرِ قَالَ لَأَقْتُلَنَّكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"\"If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah, the cherisher of the worlds.","commentary":"Continuing the story from the previous verse, the son whose sacrifice was accepted responds to his brother's death threat. He states very clearly that even if his brother attempts to kill him, he will not retaliate in kind. His reason is rooted in his fear of Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all creation. This emphasizes that his peaceful stance is not due to weakness, but to his faith and obedience to Allah's commands, which prohibit aggression and murder. This response further highlights the moral difference between the two brothers and underscores the value of life and the prohibition of unjust killing in the sight of Allah.","arabic":"لَئِنْ بَسَطْتَ إِلَيَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِي مَا أَنَا بِبَاسِطٍ يَدِيَ إِلَيْكَ لِأَقْتُلَكَ ۖ إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّهَ رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"\"For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.\"","commentary":"In this verse, the righteous son continues his plea to his aggressor brother. He explains that by not resisting the attack and allowing himself to be killed, the brother would bear the full weight of his own sin of murder. He warns his brother that committing this sin would lead him to the Fire, which is the consequence for those who do wrong. This is a powerful warning, not just about the earthly consequence, but about the severe accountability in the Hereafter. It shows the righteous son's deep understanding of accountability before Allah and serves as a final, serious admonition to his brother, highlighting the terrible fate that awaits the wrongdoer.","arabic":"إِنِّي أُرِيدُ أَنْ تَبُوءَ بِإِثْمِي وَإِثْمِكَ فَتَكُونَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones.","commentary":"Despite the righteous son's peaceful attitude, reasoned explanation, and warning, the other brother's inner self, driven by envy and malice, ultimately led him to commit the horrific act. He murdered his own brother, becoming the first person to commit murder in human history. The verse describes him as becoming \"one of the lost ones,\" indicating not just the loss of his brother, but the loss of his own peace, his connection to Allah, and a place among the righteous. This act demonstrates the destructive power of unchecked negative emotions and sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on the severe consequences of taking a life and disrupting peace.","arabic":"فَطَوَّعَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ قَتْلَ أَخِيهِ فَقَتَلَهُ فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"Then Allah sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. \"Woe is me!\" said he; \"Was I not even able to be as this raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?\" then he became full of regrets-","commentary":"Following the murder, the killer brother is left with the body of his brother and does not know how to dispose of it. Allah then sends a raven which scratches the ground, seemingly to bury something. This act serves as a lesson for the murderer on how to conceal the body. Witnessing this simple act by a bird leads the killer to profound remorse. He laments his inability to even match the actions of a raven in showing respect for his brother's remains. This remorse, however, is described not as repentance towards Allah, but rather a regret over the practical consequences and perhaps the realization of the enormity of his act. This incident highlights the murderer's isolation and ignorance after committing the crime, further emphasizing the devastating impact of taking a life. This story serves as a dramatic introduction to the severity of laws pertaining to murder and corruption that follow.","arabic":"فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ غُرَابًا يَبْحَثُ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُرِيَهُ كَيْفَ يُوَارِي سَوْءَةَ أَخِيهِ ۚ قَالَ يَا وَيْلَتَا أَعَجَزْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِثْلَ هَٰذَا الْغُرَابِ فَأُوَارِيَ سَوْءَةَ أَخِي ۖ فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ النَّادِمِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.","commentary":"Building on the story of the first murder, this verse introduces a principle of immense significance concerning the value of human life. It states that Allah had previously revealed to the Children of Israel a law: killing an innocent person (one who has not committed murder or spread serious corruption) is considered as grave as killing all of humanity. Conversely, saving a single life is considered as meritorious as saving all of humanity. This highlights the sanctity of life in Islam and emphasizes that every individual life holds immense value. The verse then notes that despite receiving clear guidance from Allah's messengers, many among the Children of Israel exceeded limits and committed wrongs on Earth. This serves as both a reminder of the high standard set by Allah's laws and a caution against disregarding divine guidance, linking the principle of the sanctity of life to accountability for actions.","arabic":"مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;","commentary":"This verse outlines severe punishments for those who engage in actions considered \"waging war against Allah and His Messenger\" and actively spreading corruption or disorder in society. In the context of Islamic teaching and the historical period this verse addresses, this typically refers to rebellion against a just Muslim authority that is implementing Allah's law, or engaging in acts like banditry, causing widespread fear, and attacking people's lives and property. These acts are seen as an assault on the security and well-being of the community, which is established under Allah's guidance, and thus are described as 'waging war against Allah and His Messenger'. The specified punishments – execution, crucifixion, cutting off limbs on opposite sides, or exile – are deterrent measures aimed at protecting the community and maintaining peace and order. The verse clarifies that these punishments are a disgrace in this life and do not eliminate the potential for severe punishment in the Hereafter, emphasizing the gravity of such crimes in both realms.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا جَزَاءُ الَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا أَنْ يُقَتَّلُوا أَوْ يُصَلَّبُوا أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ مِنْ خِلَافٍ أَوْ يُنْفَوْا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لَهُمْ خِزْيٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"34","text":"Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the stern warnings and punishments outlined in the previous verse for those who spread corruption and disrupt society, this verse provides a path to mercy. It states that these severe punishments can be waived for those who repent sincerely and change their ways *before* they are apprehended or brought under the authority of the state. This shows that Islam prioritizes repentance and reform, offering forgiveness even for very serious crimes if the person genuinely turns back to Allah and makes amends while they still have the choice to do so. It underscores the attributes of Allah as \"Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful,\" indicating that His mercy is vast and available to those who seek it with sincerity, highlighting a balance between justice and mercy.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَقْدِرُوا عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"35","text":"O ye who believe! Do your duty to Allah, seek the means of approach unto Him, and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may prosper.","commentary":"After discussing the story of the first murder and establishing laws against taking life and spreading corruption, the focus shifts to addressing the believers directly. This verse provides guidance on how to live a righteous life that leads to success in this world and the next. It calls upon believers to be mindful of their duty to Allah, to seek ways to draw closer to Him (through obedience, good deeds, and sincere devotion), and to strive diligently in His cause (which includes upholding justice, promoting good, and preventing evil in society). These actions are presented as the path to true prosperity, connecting personal piety with active engagement in building a just and peaceful community, which contrasts sharply with the actions of those described in the preceding verses who spread corruption.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَابْتَغُوا إِلَيْهِ الْوَسِيلَةَ وَجَاهِدُوا فِي سَبِيلِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"As to those who reject Faith,- if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted of them, theirs would be a grievous penalty.","commentary":"This verse serves as a powerful warning to those who actively reject faith. It states that on the Day of Judgment, if they were to possess all the wealth and possessions on Earth, multiplied even twofold, and offered it as a ransom to escape the punishment, it would be completely rejected. This vivid imagery emphasizes the immense value of faith and righteous deeds in the sight of Allah, and conversely, the utter worthlessness of worldly wealth when facing divine judgment for disbelief. It highlights the certainty and severity of the punishment for those who persist in rejecting the truth, providing a stark contrast to the potential prosperity promised to the believers in the previous verse. This reinforces the accountability inherent in Allah's justice.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لِيَفْتَدُوا بِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَا تُقُبِّلَ مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures.","commentary":"This verse continues the description from the previous verses about the fate of those who disbelieve. It paints a vivid picture of their situation in the Hereafter, specifically in the Fire (often referred to as Hell). It explains that in their suffering, they will desperately wish to escape this torment. However, the verse makes it clear that their escape will be impossible. Their punishment is described as \"one that endures,\" meaning it will be continuous and without end. This underscores the severity of the consequences for persistent disbelief and wrongdoing in the sight of Allah.","arabic":"يُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَخْرُجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ وَمَا هُمْ بِخَارِجِينَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُقِيمٌ"},{"verse":"38","text":"As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.","commentary":"Transitioning from the consequences in the afterlife, this verse introduces a specific law within the Islamic framework regarding theft in a society governed by Islamic principles. It states that for a thief, male or female, their hand is to be cut off. The verse emphasizes that this is a punishment ordained by Allah and serves as an \"example\" or deterrent for their crime. This is understood within the context of a just society where basic needs are met and opportunities are provided, and property rights are protected. The commentary highlights that in such a society, theft is seen as a serious transgression against both individuals and the community's security. It's important to note that this punishment is understood to be applied only under very specific conditions and with strict legal safeguards to prevent its misuse and ensure justice, including a minimum value for stolen goods and considerations of necessity or doubt, which can prevent its enforcement. The verse concludes by reminding us that Allah is \"Exalted in power\" and \"Wise,\" signifying that His laws are based on ultimate authority and profound knowledge.","arabic":"وَالسَّارِقُ وَالسَّارِقَةُ فَاقْطَعُوا أَيْدِيَهُمَا جَزَاءً بِمَا كَسَبَا نَكَالًا مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"39","text":"But if the thief repents after his crime, and amends his conduct, Allah turneth to him in forgiveness; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the severe punishment outlined for theft in the previous verse, this verse immediately opens the door to hope and mercy through repentance. It explains that if a person who has committed theft genuinely repents after their crime and takes steps to improve their behavior and make amends, Allah is willing to forgive them. This shows that while the law provides a deterrent and a consequence for the crime in this world (if the legal conditions for the punishment are met before repentance), Allah's forgiveness in the Hereafter is vast for those who sincerely turn back to Him. The verse explicitly reminds us of Allah's attributes, being \"Oft-forgiving\" and \"Most Merciful,\" highlighting the importance of turning to Allah for forgiveness and seeking to lead a righteous life after making a mistake. This connects the concept of justice and punishment with the divine attribute of mercy and the opportunity for spiritual reconciliation.","arabic":"فَمَنْ تَابَ مِنْ بَعْدِ ظُلْمِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"40","text":"Knowest thou not that to Allah (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He pleaseth, and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and Allah hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse concludes this section by emphasizing Allah's absolute sovereignty and control over everything that exists, in the heavens and on earth. It reinforces the idea that Allah alone has the ultimate authority to punish and to forgive whomever He chooses. This serves as a foundational principle underlying all the laws and decrees mentioned previously, including the punishments and the opportunity for repentance. It reminds us that worldly laws and consequences are part of a larger divine order, but Allah's power encompasses all things, including the final judgment and outcome for every individual. This provides a broader perspective, linking the specific legal rulings back to the fundamental Islamic belief in Allah's supreme dominion and power over all creation.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ يُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"41","text":"O Messenger! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say \"We believe\" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, \"If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!\" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment.","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing Prophet Muhammad, reassuring him and telling him not to be saddened by those who are actively choosing disbelief. This includes people who claim to believe outwardly but whose hearts do not hold true faith (sometimes referred to as hypocrites), and also some among the Jewish community at that time. These individuals were described as eagerly listening to falsehoods and even seeking advice from others who had not encountered the Prophet directly. They were also known to distort the meaning of their own religious texts and try to manipulate outcomes. It's mentioned that they would approach the Prophet for a ruling on an issue but would only accept his judgment if it aligned with what they wanted, warning each other to be cautious otherwise.\n\nThe verse explains that if someone is being tested by Allah, the Prophet cannot help them against Allah's will. It states that it is not Allah's plan to purify the hearts of such people who actively choose this path. Consequently, they will face disgrace in this life and severe punishment in the Hereafter. This verse sets the stage by describing the challenging environment the Prophet faced from those actively opposing him and their insincere approach to matters of faith and law.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ لَا يَحْزُنْكَ الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْكُفْرِ مِنَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا آمَنَّا بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَلَمْ تُؤْمِنْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۛ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُوا ۛ سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ سَمَّاعُونَ لِقَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ لَمْ يَأْتُوكَ ۖ يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوَاضِعِهِ ۖ يَقُولُونَ إِنْ أُوتِيتُمْ هَٰذَا فَخُذُوهُ وَإِنْ لَمْ تُؤْتَوْهُ فَاحْذَرُوا ۚ وَمَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَنْ تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ أَنْ يُطَهِّرَ قُلُوبَهُمْ ۚ لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"42","text":"(They are fond of) listening to falsehood, of devouring anything forbidden. If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere. If thou decline, they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge, judge in equity between them. For Allah loveth those who judge in equity.","commentary":"Continuing the description from the previous verse, this verse highlights two negative characteristics of the people mentioned: they enjoy listening to lies, and they consume things that are forbidden or unlawful, which could include ill-gotten gains like bribes or usury. It then gives Prophet Muhammad a choice regarding these individuals if they come to him seeking a judgment in their disputes: he may choose to judge between them or decline to get involved. If he chooses not to judge, they cannot harm him in any way. However, if he decides to judge, he is instructed to do so with absolute fairness and justice, because Allah loves those who are just. This verse connects to the previous one by further detailing the character of those who opposed the Prophet and outlining a specific way for him to deal with their attempts to involve him in their affairs.","arabic":"سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ أَكَّالُونَ لِلسُّحْتِ ۚ فَإِنْ جَاءُوكَ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ تُعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ فَلَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْئًا ۖ وَإِنْ حَكَمْتَ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) law before them?- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that, they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith.","commentary":"This verse poses a rhetorical question, expressing surprise and bewilderment at the behavior described in the previous verses. It questions why these individuals, particularly the Jews mentioned earlier who distort their scriptures, would come to Prophet Muhammad for judgment when they already possess the Torah, which contains Allah's clear commands and law. Despite having their own Divine scripture with plain guidance, they still seek judgment from the Prophet, and even then, they are ready to turn away from it if it doesn't suit them. The verse concludes with a definitive statement: because of this attitude of having Allah's law but turning away from it or from a judgment based on it, they are not true believers. This highlights the crucial point that true faith involves accepting and submitting to Allah's law, not picking and choosing based on convenience or desire. It links back to the earlier description of their insincerity and lays the groundwork for the following verses which discuss the role of Divine law in different religious traditions.","arabic":"وَكَيْفَ يُحَكِّمُونَكَ وَعِنْدَهُمُ التَّوْرَاةُ فِيهَا حُكْمُ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers.","commentary":"Following the question in the previous verse about why they turn away from the Torah, this verse emphasizes the significance of the Torah itself. It states that Allah revealed the Torah to Prophet Moses, containing guidance and light. This law from Allah was the standard by which the Jews were judged by the prophets (who were submissive to Allah's will) and by their religious scholars and jurists. These individuals were entrusted with preserving Allah's Book and were witnesses to its truth. The verse then directs those who carry this responsibility (implicitly, the religious leaders and judges, and by extension, Muslims) not to fear people but to fear Allah alone, and not to exchange Allah's revelations for worldly gain. It concludes with a strong declaration: those who do not judge according to what Allah has revealed are indeed disbelievers. This verse establishes that judging by Divine law was fundamental not just in Islam but also in the tradition of Prophet Moses, and it clearly defines the consequence of failing to uphold this principle, linking it directly to a lack of faith. It connects to the previous verse by elaborating on the content and authority of the Torah.","arabic":"إِنَّا أَنْزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ ۚ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُوا لِلَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالْأَحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُوا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ وَكَانُوا عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَاءَ ۚ فَلَا تَخْشَوُا النَّاسَ وَاخْشَوْنِ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۚ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَحْكُمْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"We ordained therein for them: \"Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.\" But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (No better than) wrong-doers.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse about the Torah containing Allah's law, this verse provides specific examples of the judgments ordained within it, illustrating the principle of 'retaliation' or equal requital for physical injuries: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, and so on for other body parts and wounds. These laws were also incorporated into the final Islamic law. However, the verse adds a provision, which is part of the Islamic application of this principle, that if someone chooses to forgive the retaliation as an act of charity, it will be a means of atonement (purification) for some of their own sins. This highlights mercy as a virtuous option within the framework of justice. The verse ends with another declaration about those who do not judge according to what Allah has revealed: they are wrongdoers. This serves as a further description, alongside \"unbelievers\" from the previous verse, of those who fail to implement Allah's law. It connects to the previous verse by giving concrete examples of the \"guidance and light\" found in the Torah's laws.","arabic":"وَكَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيهَا أَنَّ النَّفْسَ بِالنَّفْسِ وَالْعَيْنَ بِالْعَيْنِ وَالْأَنْفَ بِالْأَنْفِ وَالْأُذُنَ بِالْأُذُنِ وَالسِّنَّ بِالسِّنِّ وَالْجُرُوحَ قِصَاصٌ ۚ فَمَنْ تَصَدَّقَ بِهِ فَهُوَ كَفَّارَةٌ لَهُ ۚ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَحْكُمْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.","commentary":"Following the discussion of the Torah revealed to Prophet Moses, this verse moves on to the next major Divine revelation. It states that following the prophets of Israel, Allah sent Prophet Jesus, son of Mary. He was sent in the footsteps of the earlier prophets, confirming the law (Torah) that came before him. Allah gave him the Gospel, which also contained guidance and light. The Gospel served to confirm the Torah and was a source of guidance and admonition (a reminder and warning) specifically for those who were God-fearing or mindful of Allah. This verse shows the continuity of Divine revelation, where the Gospel built upon and confirmed the previous scripture, the Torah, for its people. It transitions to the next stage in the history of Divine messages.","arabic":"وَقَفَّيْنَا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمْ بِعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ ۖ وَآتَيْنَاهُ الْإِنْجِيلَ فِيهِ هُدًى وَنُورٌ وَمُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةً لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel.","commentary":"Just as the people of the Torah were instructed to judge by their scripture, this verse instructs the followers of the Gospel (Christians) to judge according to what Allah revealed in the Gospel. It reinforces the principle that Divine law is the basis for judgment for the community that receives it. It then states that those who fail to judge by what Allah has revealed are transgressors or rebels. This adds a third description, alongside \"unbelievers\" and \"wrongdoers\" from earlier verses, for those who do not judge according to Allah's law. It connects directly to the previous verse by specifying the responsibility that comes with receiving the Gospel and clarifies the consequence of neglecting that responsibility.","arabic":"وَلْيَحْكُمْ أَهْلُ الْإِنْجِيلِ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ ۚ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَحْكُمْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;","commentary":"This verse introduces the final Divine scripture, the Qur'an, revealed to Prophet Muhammad. It is described as containing the truth, confirming the previous scriptures, and also guarding or superseding them, meaning it is the final, complete, and authoritative revelation. Prophet Muhammad is instructed to judge among people (including those from other faiths who came to him, as mentioned earlier) based on what Allah has revealed in the Qur'an, and not to follow their personal desires, which deviate from the truth he has received. The verse then explains that Allah has given each community (including previous nations who received scriptures) a specific code of law and a clear path. It clarifies that Allah could have made all humanity one single community, but He chose to give different communities distinct laws and ways as a test to see how they would use what He gave them. Therefore, instead of seeking uniformity in law across communities (prior to the universal message of Islam), people are encouraged to compete with each other in performing good deeds. The verse reminds everyone that they will all return to Allah, who will clarify the truth of the matters they disputed about. This verse transitions to the Qur'an as the final, universal standard, while acknowledging the diversity of previous Divine laws, linking back to the earlier verses about the Torah and the Gospel. It gives context to why there were different laws before Islam.","arabic":"وَأَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ ۖ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ عَمَّا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ ۚ لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنْكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَٰكِنْ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَا آتَاكُمْ ۖ فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ ۚ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious.","commentary":"This verse reiterates and strengthens the command given in the previous one. Prophet Muhammad is again instructed to judge between people according to what Allah has revealed and not to follow their personal desires. This time, the warning is emphasized further: he is told to be extremely cautious so that they do not tempt him away from *any part* of the teachings that Allah has sent down to him. This highlights the importance of adhering strictly to the entirety of Allah's revelation without compromise. The verse then addresses the possibility of people turning away from this standard of judgment. It states that if they turn away, the Prophet should be assured that it is Allah's intention to afflict or punish them for some of their misdeeds, as indeed, many people are rebellious by nature. This reinforces that turning away from Allah's law is a serious offense that warrants consequence from Allah Himself. It connects to the previous verse by repeating and intensifying the command to judge by Allah's revelation.","arabic":"وَأَنِ احْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ وَاحْذَرْهُمْ أَنْ يَفْتِنُوكَ عَنْ بَعْضِ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ ۖ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ أَنْ يُصِيبَهُمْ بِبَعْضِ ذُنُوبِهِمْ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنَ النَّاسِ لَفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"Do they then seek after a judgment of (the days of) ignorance? But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than Allah?","commentary":"This verse concludes the passage with a powerful question and statement. It asks if those who turn away from judging by what Allah has revealed are perhaps seeking the judgment of the \"days of ignorance\" (Jahiliyyah). In Islamic understanding, \"Jahiliyyah\" refers not just to a historical period before Islam but to any state or time when human desires, opinions, or man-made laws are followed instead of the Divine system revealed by Allah. It signifies being ruled by human authority rather than Allah's authority. The verse then poses a final, rhetorical question to emphasize the superiority of Allah's law: for people who have firm faith, who could possibly provide a better judgment than Allah? This highlights the central message of the passage: that accepting and judging by Allah's revealed law is the only logical choice for a true believer, because Allah's law is the most just, wise, and beneficial for humanity. It directly contrasts the two possible paths: submission to Allah's perfect law or following flawed human-made systems, connecting back to the entire discussion about the necessity of judging by Divine revelation found in the Torah, Gospel, and finally the Qur'an.","arabic":"أَفَحُكْمَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ يَبْغُونَ ۚ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حُكْمًا لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust.","commentary":"This verse speaks directly to those who have committed to the Islamic way of life, instructing them not to take people of earlier revelations (Jews and Christians) as close allies or protectors. It explains that these groups form alliances among themselves. The message is clear: if you choose to ally yourself closely with them in a way that compromises your commitment to the community of believers, you essentially align yourself with them, removing yourself from the group of believers whose loyalty is solely with Allah. This is because sincere belief requires a specific orientation of loyalty and trust. Seeking such alliances with those whose primary loyalty lies elsewhere is seen as a form of injustice, which Allah does not guide. This guidance helps define the unique identity and framework of the community of believers.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۘ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them, saying: \"We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster.\" Ah! perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory, or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts.","commentary":"Following the warning about alliances in the previous verse, this verse highlights the behavior of those whose faith is weak or insincere. It describes how these individuals eagerly seek alliances with people of earlier revelations, justifying their actions by claiming they fear negative changes in their circumstances or future misfortunes. The verse then reassures the believers that Allah may grant them victory or bring about another event of His will, which will expose the true intentions of these wavering individuals. They will then regret the thoughts and hidden loyalties they harbored. This serves as both a prophecy and a caution against insincere motives, emphasizing that relying on Allah's plan is superior to seeking security in other alliances.","arabic":"فَتَرَى الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ يُسَارِعُونَ فِيهِمْ يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَىٰ أَنْ تُصِيبَنَا دَائِرَةٌ ۚ فَعَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِالْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِنْ عِنْدِهِ فَيُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ مَا أَسَرُّوا فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ نَادِمِينَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"And those who believe will say: \"Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah, that they were with you?\" All that they do will be in vain, and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this describes the reaction of the sincere believers once the truth about the weak-hearted or hypocritical individuals is revealed, likely following a victory or event from Allah as mentioned in Verse 52. The believers will express astonishment that these were the same people who had sworn strong oaths of loyalty to them. The verse states that the actions of these insincere individuals will be rendered useless, and they will ultimately face failure and loss. This underscores the consequence of divided loyalty and insincere commitment, reinforcing the importance of the exclusive alliance mentioned in the earlier verses.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَهَٰؤُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ أَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ ۙ إِنَّهُمْ لَمَعَكُمْ ۚ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَأَصْبَحُوا خَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith, soon will Allah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him,- lowly with the believers, mighty against the rejecters, fighting in the way of Allah, and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the grace of Allah, which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And Allah encompasseth all, and He knoweth all things.","commentary":"Building upon the warning implicit in the consequences described in Verse 53, this verse addresses the believers with a strong message about the permanence and resilience of Islam. It warns that if any among them abandon their faith, Allah will replace them with a new group of people. These people are characterized by a deep, mutual love for Allah, humility and kindness towards fellow believers, firmness and strength against those who reject the truth, dedicated effort (striving) in Allah's cause, and fearlessness in the face of criticism. This highlights the qualities valued by Allah in those who uphold His message and serves as an assurance that the mission of Islam will continue regardless of who chooses to abandon it. This replacement is described as a special favor from Allah, given to whomever He wills, emphasizing His boundless grace and complete knowledge.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَنْ يَرْتَدَّ مِنْكُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِي اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ يُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لَائِمٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"55","text":"Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship).","commentary":"This verse explicitly defines the true source of alliance and support for the believers, contrasting it with the forbidden alliances mentioned earlier in Verse 51. It states that their only real allies and protectors are Allah, His Messenger (Prophet Muhammad), and the community of believers. It further specifies key characteristics of these sincere believers: they consistently perform their prayers (connecting with Allah), give the purifying charity (zakat - supporting the community and purifying wealth), and humbly submit in worship. This provides a clear standard for identifying true fellow believers and emphasizes that genuine alliance is based on shared faith and practice, reinforcing the principle of exclusive loyalty to Allah and His community.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ رَاكِعُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- it is the fellowship of Allah that must certainly triumph.","commentary":"This verse serves as a powerful conclusion to the discussion about true alliances, drawing a direct consequence from the principle laid out in Verse 55. It promises certain triumph for those who make their primary alliance and source of support Allah, His Messenger, and the community of believers. This is presented as an inevitable outcome for \"Allah's party,\" emphasizing that ultimate victory belongs to those who align themselves fully with the Divine will and community. This promise is a source of strength and reassurance for believers committed to the path outlined in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَتَوَلَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَإِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْغَالِبُونَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).","commentary":"This verse returns to the theme of prohibited alliances, extending the prohibition from Verse 51 to include anyone, whether from the people of earlier revelations or those who reject faith entirely, who treats the religion of Islam with mockery or sport. The message underscores the incompatibility of genuine faith with forming close alliances with those who disrespect or ridicule what is sacred to believers. It links this prohibition directly to the requirement of fearing Allah, urging believers to live up to the demands of their faith by clearly distancing themselves from those who would denigrate it. This reinforces the concept of the distinct identity of the believing community.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا دِينَكُمْ هُزُوًا وَلَعِبًا مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ وَالْكُفَّارَ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it (but) as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding.","commentary":"This verse provides a specific example of the type of mockery mentioned in the previous verse (Verse 57). It highlights how the call to prayer (adhan), a central and sacred act in Islam, is treated with ridicule by those mentioned. The verse attributes this behavior to a lack of understanding or impaired reason. A sound mind, it implies, would recognize and respect the acknowledgment of the Divine. This specific example serves to illustrate the depth of the disrespect shown towards the faith and strengthens the justification for the prohibition of alliances with such people.","arabic":"وَإِذَا نَادَيْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ اتَّخَذُوهَا هُزُوًا وَلَعِبًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"Say: \"O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us), and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?\"","commentary":"The passage shifts focus here, instructing Prophet Muhammad (and by extension, the believers) to directly address the people of earlier revelations. It challenges them by asking if their disapproval of the Muslims stems from any reason other than the core of the Muslims' faith: belief in Allah, in the Qur'an revealed to Prophet Muhammad, and in the original truths of earlier revelations that the Qur'an affirms. The verse also suggests another underlying reason for their animosity might be that many among them are rebellious and disobedient to Allah's commands. This direct confrontation highlights the fundamental difference between the two groups and points to belief and obedience to Allah as the central point of contention. This follows logically from the previous verses which emphasized the distinction between believers and others.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ هَلْ تَنْقِمُونَ مِنَّا إِلَّا أَنْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَأَنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ فَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"Say: \"Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, (as judged) by the treatment it received from Allah? those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even path!\"","commentary":"This verse continues the address to the people of earlier revelations from Verse 59, reminding them of historical events concerning their forefathers who faced severe consequences from Allah for their disobedience and rejection of His messages. It points out that certain past actions of their ancestors led to Allah's curse, wrath, and transformations as a punishment. The verse also mentions that some of them \"worshipped evil,\" which in the Qur'anic context can mean obeying authorities or systems that go against Allah's law, rather than literally bowing down to idols. The message here is a stark reminder that while their current disapproval of Muslims is based on their own deviation, the historical pattern of rejecting Allah's guidance led to a far worse state and deviation from the right path, emphasizing the gravity of persistent disobedience.","arabic":"قُلْ هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِشَرٍّ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ مَثُوبَةً عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۚ مَنْ لَعَنَهُ اللَّهُ وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهُمُ الْقِرَدَةَ وَالْخَنَازِيرَ وَعَبَدَ الطَّاغُوتَ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ شَرٌّ مَكَانًا وَأَضَلُّ عَنْ سَوَاءِ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"61","text":"When they come to thee, they say: \"We believe\": but in fact they enter with a mind against Faith, and they go out with the same but Allah knoweth fully all that they hide.","commentary":"This verse describes people who approached Prophet Muhammad outwardly claiming to have accepted the faith of Islam. However, their inner reality was different. When they came to the Prophet, they would say they believed, but in their hearts, they rejected faith. And they left in the same state of disbelief they arrived with. This highlights a lack of sincerity; their words did not match their true feelings or intentions. The verse concludes by reminding us that Allah is fully aware of everything they conceal, emphasizing Allah's complete knowledge of people's hidden thoughts and motives, which contrasts with their attempts to deceive others. This sets the stage for the following verses, which describe the sinful actions that stem from this inner state of insincerity and disbelief.","arabic":"وَإِذَا جَاءُوكُمْ قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَقَدْ دَخَلُوا بِالْكُفْرِ وَهُمْ قَدْ خَرَجُوا بِهِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Many of them dost thou see, racing each other in sin and rancour, and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do.","commentary":"Following the description of inner insincerity in the previous verse, this verse illustrates the behavior resulting from it. It observes that many among these insincere people were eager to engage in sinful acts, harbor ill will, and consume things that are forbidden by divine law. The imagery of \"racing each other\" suggests a competitive zeal in doing wrong. These actions are strongly condemned as \"evil indeed,\" highlighting the negative consequences of their lack of genuine faith and their willingness to transgress divine boundaries.","arabic":"وَتَرَىٰ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَأَكْلِهِمُ السُّحْتَ ۚ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their (habit of) uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are their works.","commentary":"This verse raises a question directed at the religious leaders among these people, such as their rabbis and scholars of law. It asks why these leaders did not prevent their followers from speaking sinful words and consuming forbidden things, actions mentioned in the preceding verse. By highlighting the leaders' silence or inaction, the verse implicitly criticizes their failure to uphold and enforce the divine law and guide their community away from harmful practices. This inaction is also labeled as \"evil,\" suggesting that failing to forbid wrong when one has the authority or knowledge to do so is itself a significant failing. This continues the theme of corruption and deviation from divine guidance, extending the criticism to those in positions of religious authority.","arabic":"لَوْلَا يَنْهَاهُمُ الرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالْأَحْبَارُ عَنْ قَوْلِهِمُ الْإِثْمَ وَأَكْلِهِمُ السُّحْتَ ۚ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا يَصْنَعُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"The Jews say: \"Allah's hand is tied up.\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief.","commentary":"This verse addresses a blasphemous statement attributed to some Jews: claiming that \"Allah's hand is tied up.\" This phrase implies that Allah is unable to give generously or that His power is restricted, possibly in response to calls for charity or acknowledging His bounty. The verse strongly refutes this, wishing that their own hands be restricted and condemning them for their utterance. It asserts Allah's boundless generosity and power, stating that \"both His hands are widely outstretched; He giveth and spendeth as He pleaseth.\"\n\nThe verse then notes that despite the truth coming in the revelation to Prophet Muhammad, it only causes many among them to become more stubborn in their rejection and disbelief. It mentions that Allah has caused internal division and animosity among them that will persist until the Day of Judgment. Furthermore, it highlights their persistent attempts to initiate conflict and spread corruption on earth, but affirms that Allah always thwarts their efforts to wage war. The verse concludes by stating that Allah does not love those who spread mischief. This verse serves to further illustrate the depth of the rejection and hostility stemming from the insincerity mentioned in earlier verses and highlights divine responses to such attitudes and actions.","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللَّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ ۚ غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُوا بِمَا قَالُوا ۘ بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنْفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا ۚ وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ كُلَّمَا أَوْقَدُوا نَارًا لِلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا اللَّهُ ۚ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا ۚ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to offer a potential positive outcome for the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). It presents a conditional statement: if they had truly believed in Allah and been righteous, Allah would have forgiven their past wrongdoings and granted them entry into paradise in the hereafter. This verse contrasts with the negative descriptions in the preceding verses by showing the reward available to them if they chose faith and righteousness, emphasizing Allah's mercy and the path to salvation. It sets up the following verse which discusses worldly rewards.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلَأَدْخَلْنَاهُمْ جَنَّاتِ النَّعِيمِ"},{"verse":"66","text":"If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them a party on the right course: but many of them follow a course that is evil.","commentary":"Building on the theme of the previous verse, this verse elaborates on the benefits the People of the Book would have received, specifically in this worldly life, had they adhered truly to their scriptures – the Torah, the Gospel, and all other revelations sent by Allah. It states that following divine law would have brought them widespread prosperity and well-being (\"enjoyed happiness from every side\"). This emphasizes the Islamic principle that adhering to divine guidance brings benefits in both this life and the hereafter. The verse acknowledges that throughout history, a group among the People of the Book did follow a righteous path, but it concludes by stating that the majority of them were and are on a path of disobedience and wrongdoing. This distinction provides a nuanced view while reinforcing the main point about the consequences of rejecting or distorting divine guidance.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ أَقَامُوا التَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنْجِيلَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ لَأَكَلُوا مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِنْ تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِمْ ۚ مِنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُقْتَصِدَةٌ ۖ وَكَثِيرٌ مِنْهُمْ سَاءَ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"O Messenger! proclaim the (message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not, thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And Allah will defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.","commentary":"Allah addresses Prophet Muhammad, instructing him to fully convey everything that has been revealed to him. This is presented as an essential part of fulfilling his duty as a Messenger. If any part of the message were withheld, the mission would not be complete. Allah promises to protect the Prophet from those who might try to harm him. The verse concludes by stating that Allah does not guide those who choose to reject faith. This verse establishes the fundamental requirement for the Prophet to deliver the divine message entirely, setting the stage for the specific messages that follow.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۖ وَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"Say: \"O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.\" It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord, that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith.","commentary":"Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad to tell the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) that their beliefs and practices are not truly valid unless they adhere to the teachings of the Torah, the Gospel, and all other revelations sent down by Allah. From the Islamic perspective, this implies that their adherence would lead them to recognize and accept the final revelation, the Qur'an. This declaration of truth, however, is noted to often cause many among them to become more resistant and firm in their disbelief. The Prophet is advised not to feel sorrow for those who persist in rejecting faith. This verse delivers a direct message to the People of the Book, clarifying the Islamic view of their position and linking their scriptures to the call to accept the final message, following on from the general command in the previous verse to proclaim the message.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لَسْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ تُقِيمُوا التَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنْجِيلَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۗ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا ۖ فَلَا تَأْسَ عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse highlights a fundamental principle of faith. It states that regardless of whether people identify as Muslims, Jews, Sabians (often understood as a group who believed in one God but didn't strictly follow Judaism or Christianity at the time), or Christians, anyone who genuinely believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs righteous deeds, will be safe from fear and grief. This emphasizes the common ground of true faith and good actions as the basis for salvation, offering a message of hope and reassurance following the previous verse which addressed deviation.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئُونَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers, every time, there came to them a messenger with what they themselves desired not - some (of these) they called impostors, and some they (go so far as to) slay.","commentary":"Providing historical context, this verse recalls the covenant Allah made with the Children of Israel (the Jewish people). It mentions that Allah sent them many messengers over time. However, the verse notes that whenever a messenger brought them a message or instruction that was not to their liking or contradicted their desires, they often rejected the messenger, calling some liars and even killing others. This illustrates a pattern of resistance to divine guidance among them, setting the stage for the continued discussion of their history and beliefs in the following verses.","arabic":"لَقَدْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ رُسُلًا ۖ كُلَّمَا جَاءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُهُمْ فَرِيقًا كَذَّبُوا وَفَرِيقًا يَقْتُلُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf; yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do.","commentary":"Continuing the account of the Children of Israel from the previous verse, this verse explains their state. They acted as if they believed they would face no consequences or punishment for their actions, including rejecting and harming messengers. This presumption caused them to become spiritually blind and deaf, unable to perceive or respond to the truth. Despite this, Allah in His mercy offered them opportunities for repentance. However, the verse states that many returned to this state of spiritual blindness and deafness. It concludes with a reminder that Allah is fully aware of everything they do, implying that they will be held accountable.","arabic":"وَحَسِبُوا أَلَّا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ فَعَمُوا وَصَمُّوا ثُمَّ تَابَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ عَمُوا وَصَمُّوا كَثِيرٌ مِنْهُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"They do blaspheme who say: \"Allah is Christ the son of Mary.\" But said Christ: \"O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific belief held by some Christians. It states that those who say Allah is Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, have deviated from the truth. To clarify the matter, the verse directly quotes Prophet Jesus himself, who called on the Children of Israel to worship Allah, referring to Allah as \"my Lord and your Lord,\" thereby confirming his own servitude to Allah. The verse then issues a strong warning that anyone who associates partners with Allah will be forbidden from entering Paradise and will reside in the Fire, with no one to help them. This verse directly challenges the concept of Jesus' divinity, emphasizing the principle of Allah's absolute oneness and preparing the way for the next verse.","arabic":"لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۖ وَقَالَ الْمَسِيحُ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ ۖ إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ"},{"verse":"73","text":"They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them.","commentary":"Following the challenge to the divinity of Jesus, this verse addresses another belief, stating that those who say Allah is part of a Trinity are also in error. It firmly reiterates the core Islamic principle of absolute monotheism: \"there is no god except One Allah.\" The verse then warns that unless people abandon these assertions, a severe punishment will befall those who persist in such disbelief. This verse directly confronts the concept of the Trinity, reinforcing the unique and singular nature of Allah, building upon the monotheistic message of the previous verse.","arabic":"لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ ۘ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ لَمْ يَنْتَهُوا عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Why turn they not to Allah, and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"After highlighting the deviations in belief regarding Jesus and the Trinity, this verse offers a path to redemption. It poses a question, urging those who hold these beliefs to reflect: Why do they not turn back to Allah and seek His forgiveness? It emphasizes Allah's divine attributes, stating that Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful, indicating that the door to repentance is open for those who are willing to return to the truth. This verse provides a message of hope and mercy, immediately following the stern warnings about disbelief.","arabic":"أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!","commentary":"Returning to the nature of Prophet Jesus and his mother, Mary, this verse offers simple evidence of their humanity. It states clearly that Prophet Jesus was simply a messenger, just like many messengers who came before him. His mother, Mary, is described as a truthful woman. A key point highlighted is that both of them ate food, a basic biological need that is characteristic of human beings, not the Divine. The verse observes how clearly Allah presents such signs pointing towards the truth, yet wonders at how people still turn away from it despite this clarity, reinforcing the argument against their divinity presented in verses 72-73.","arabic":"مَا الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ وَأُمُّهُ صِدِّيقَةٌ ۖ كَانَا يَأْكُلَانِ الطَّعَامَ ۗ انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ الْآيَاتِ ثُمَّ انْظُرْ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"Say: \"Will ye worship, besides Allah, something which hath no power either to harm or benefit you? But Allah,- He it is that heareth and knoweth all things.\"","commentary":"Concluding the arguments against associating partners with Allah and deviating from monotheism, this verse presents a powerful, logical question: Why would anyone worship anything besides Allah that possesses no power to cause harm or bring benefit? It contrasts this lack of power in created beings with Allah's absolute power, emphasizing that only Allah is the one who hears all prayers and supplications and knows all things. This rhetorical question serves to highlight the irrationality of worshipping anything other than the true Creator and Sustainer, summarizing the arguments presented in the preceding verses (72-75).","arabic":"قُلْ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا ۚ وَاللَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"77","text":"Say: \"O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper), trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by,- who misled many, and strayed (themselves) from the even way.","commentary":"This verse is a direct address to the People of the Book (which in the Qur'an primarily refers to Jews and Christians). It calls upon them not to go to extremes in their religious beliefs and practices, meaning not to deviate from the truth given in their scriptures. It warns against following the desires and paths of those who had previously gone astray and led others away from the straight path. From a Muslim perspective, this relates to deviations from the core principle of Allah's absolute oneness and the proper understanding of Allah's prophets, including Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him). This verse sets the stage for the following verses, which detail some specific instances of deviation.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا تَغْلُوا فِي دِينِكُمْ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا أَهْوَاءَ قَوْمٍ قَدْ ضَلُّوا مِنْ قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّوا كَثِيرًا وَضَلُّوا عَنْ سَوَاءِ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"78","text":"Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses.","commentary":"Following the general warning in the previous verse, this verse specifically mentions some among the Children of Israel (Jews) who were subject to Allah's displeasure, expressed through the words of Prophet David and Prophet Jesus (peace be upon them). This was because they persistently disobeyed Allah's commands and went beyond the limits set by their religion. This highlights that the deviation discussed is not new but has historical roots, affecting previous communities of faith.","arabic":"لُعِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ لِسَانِ دَاوُودَ وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْا وَكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did.","commentary":"Continuing the description of the Children of Israel mentioned in the previous verse, this verse points to another reason for the displeasure they incurred: they failed to prevent one another from committing wrong actions. When people within a community see evil being done but do not speak out against it or try to stop it, this allows wrongdoing to become widespread. This highlights the importance within Islam of individuals encouraging what is right and discouraging what is wrong within their community. Their failure to do so is described as a grave deficiency.","arabic":"كَانُوا لَا يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَنْ مُنْكَرٍ فَعَلُوهُ ۚ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result), that Allah's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide.","commentary":"This verse describes a characteristic of many among the People of the Book at that time: forming close alliances or friendships with those who rejected faith in Allah and His messengers. From the Islamic perspective, this alliance with disbelievers is seen as a consequence of their own lack of true faith and deviation, mentioned in the preceding verses. It is described as a sign of what their inner selves have led them to do, resulting in Allah's displeasure and facing consequences for their actions.","arabic":"تَرَىٰ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ لَبِئْسَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ لَهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ أَنْ سَخِطَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَفِي الْعَذَابِ هُمْ خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"If only they had believed in Allah, in the Prophet, and in what hath been revealed to him, never would they have taken them for friends and protectors, but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers.","commentary":"This verse explains the reason behind the alliances mentioned in the previous verse. It clarifies that if they had truly believed in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the revelation sent to him (the Qur'an), they would not have formed such close alliances with those who reject faith. The verse states that their willingness to ally with disbelievers indicates that most of them lack true belief and are rebellious. This verse reinforces the idea that alliances and loyalties in Islam are fundamentally based on shared faith in Allah and acceptance of His final message through Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).","arabic":"وَلَوْ كَانُوا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالنَّبِيِّ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَا اتَّخَذُوهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ وَلَٰكِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, \"We are Christians\": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.","commentary":"This verse describes the different attitudes of various groups of people towards the believers in Islam. It indicates that, in general, you will find some of the strongest opposition to believers coming from certain Jewish groups and those who associate partners with Allah (Pagans). This is based on historical interactions and the challenges the early Muslim community faced.\n\nIn contrast, the verse highlights that you will find some of those who identify as Christians to be closer in affection towards believers. It mentions specific reasons for this, noting that among them are individuals devoted to religious learning and those who live simply, suggesting they possess humility and are not arrogant, which makes them more receptive to truth when they encounter it. This sets the stage for the description in the following verses about how some Christians reacted when they heard the message of the Qur’an.","arabic":"لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ النَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا ۖ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَوَدَّةً لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّا نَصَارَىٰ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا وَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger, thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognise the truth: they pray: \"Our Lord! we believe; write us down among the witnesses.","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse which mentioned the humility of some Christians, this verse describes the powerful impact of the Qur'an on a specific group of these individuals. When they listened to the divine revelation brought by the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him), their hearts were deeply affected. The verse illustrates this with the poignant image of their eyes overflowing with tears, indicating a profound recognition of the truth they were hearing. This emotional response is a sign of their sincerity and openness. Immediately, they express their belief and make a heartfelt prayer to Allah, asking to be recorded among those who bear witness to the truth of the message. This prayer shows their immediate acceptance and desire to be counted among the followers of Islam.","arabic":"وَإِذَا سَمِعُوا مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ تَرَىٰ أَعْيُنَهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ الدَّمْعِ مِمَّا عَرَفُوا مِنَ الْحَقِّ ۖ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا آمَنَّا فَاكْتُبْنَا مَعَ الشَّاهِدِينَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"\"What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous?\"","commentary":"Continuing from their declaration of faith and prayer in Verse 83, this verse articulates the reasoning of the specific group of Christians who responded positively to the Qur'an. They question why they should *not* believe in Allah and the truth that has been revealed to them, given their earnest hope and desire to be included among the righteous people favored by Allah. Their words reflect a deep yearning for spiritual truth and a recognition that this new message aligns with their aspiration to live righteously and attain Allah's pleasure. This reinforces their sincerity and provides the context for the reward mentioned in the next verse.","arabic":"وَمَا لَنَا لَا نُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَمَا جَاءَنَا مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَنَطْمَعُ أَنْ يُدْخِلَنَا رَبُّنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with gardens, with rivers flowing underneath,- their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who do good.","commentary":"This verse describes the reward Allah bestows upon the specific group of Christians whose sincere faith, humble response to the truth, and heartfelt prayer were highlighted in the preceding verses (82-84). Because of their genuine belief and their desire to be among the righteous, Allah has promised them a beautiful reward in the Hereafter: Gardens of Paradise with rivers flowing through them. This will be their eternal dwelling place. The verse concludes by stating that this is the reward for those who do good, confirming that their actions and intentions were pleasing to Allah and demonstrating the divine principle that sincere faith followed by righteous conduct leads to immense blessings.","arabic":"فَأَثَابَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِمَا قَالُوا جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"But those who reject Faith and belie our Signs,- they shall be companions of Hell-fire.","commentary":"In contrast to the previous verse which described the reward for those who believe and do good, this verse describes the destiny of those who choose to disbelieve and reject Allah's signs, which include the divine revelations brought by His messengers. This applies to anyone, regardless of their background, who hears the truth and chooses to turn away from it. The consequence for such rejection is to be companions of the Hellfire. This verse serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responding positively to divine guidance and highlights the different outcomes awaiting those who accept the truth versus those who reject it, concluding the passage's discussion on the attitudes towards the message of Islam.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ"},{"verse":"107","text":"But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury), let two others stand forth in their places,- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by Allah: \"We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did, behold! the wrong be upon us!\"","commentary":"This verse describes a process to follow if the initial two witnesses to a dying person's bequest are suspected of lying or dishonesty. It explains that if their guilt becomes known, two other individuals, who are the closest relatives claiming a right to the inheritance, should come forward. They are instructed to swear by Allah, affirming that their testimony is more truthful than that of the first two witnesses and that they have not deviated from the truth. They invoke consequences upon themselves if they are lying. This step is a legal safeguard to ensure fairness and uphold the deceased's wishes. It flows from the previous verse (106) which outlines the initial witnessing process for bequests, providing a mechanism for recourse if that initial process is compromised.","arabic":"فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَىٰ أَنَّهُمَا اسْتَحَقَّا إِثْمًا فَآخَرَانِ يَقُومَانِ مَقَامَهُمَا مِنَ الَّذِينَ اسْتَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَوْلَيَانِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِاللَّهِ لَشَهَادَتُنَا أَحَقُّ مِنْ شَهَادَتِهِمَا وَمَا اعْتَدَيْنَا إِنَّا إِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"108","text":"That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear Allah, and listen (to His counsel): for Allah guideth not a rebellious people:","commentary":"Following the procedure described in the previous verse (107), this verse explains the wisdom behind it. It highlights that this method is most likely to encourage witnesses to provide honest testimony from the outset. Knowing that their testimony could be challenged by the oaths of those claiming the inheritance helps deter dishonesty, as they would fear being exposed. The verse concludes with a general reminder to have conscious reverence for Allah and to pay attention to His guidance. It states that Allah does not guide those who consistently turn away from His commands, emphasizing the importance of obedience and righteousness in all matters, including upholding justice and honesty in witnessing. This final admonition connects the specific ruling back to the broader theme of accountability and following Allah's path discussed throughout this part of the Sura.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَنْ يَأْتُوا بِالشَّهَادَةِ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهَا أَوْ يَخَافُوا أَنْ تُرَدَّ أَيْمَانٌ بَعْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْمَعُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you, but commit no excess: for Allah loveth not those given to excess.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who have faith, reminding us that the authority to decide what is permissible and what is forbidden belongs only to Allah. We are taught not to restrict ourselves from the good and wholesome things that Allah has made lawful for us. Doing so, or going to extremes, is seen as exceeding the proper bounds. Allah's laws are for our benefit and well-being, and acknowledging His authority means accepting His guidance on what is good. This verse sets a principle that is then applied to various aspects of life.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُحَرِّمُوا طَيِّبَاتِ مَا أَحَلَّ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you, lawful and good; but fear Allah, in Whom ye believe.","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse, this verse explicitly instructs believers to partake of the provisions Allah has given us, emphasizing that they are lawful and good. It connects this guidance directly to our belief in Allah, reminding us to live in awe and consciousness of Him in all our actions, including how we use the resources He provides. This reinforces the idea that our faith should influence every aspect of our lives, guiding us to accept and benefit from what Allah has made permissible.","arabic":"وَكُلُوا مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي أَنْتُمْ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs, that ye may be grateful.","commentary":"This verse addresses the topic of oaths. It clarifies that Allah does not hold us accountable for unintentional or thoughtless oaths, but we are responsible for oaths we make deliberately and solemnly. If a deliberate oath is broken, Islam provides specific ways to make amends, or \"expiate,\" for it. These involve actions that benefit others: feeding ten needy people, clothing them, or freeing a captive. If one cannot afford these, fasting for three days is prescribed as an alternative. The purpose of this expiation is to emphasize the seriousness of promises made by calling on Allah's name. The verse concludes by encouraging us to uphold our oaths and acknowledging that these guidelines from Allah are meant to clarify His will, so that we may be thankful for His guidance. This links back to the theme of accepting Allah's regulations established in the preceding verses.","arabic":"لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ اللَّهُ بِاللَّغْوِ فِي أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ يُؤَاخِذُكُمْ بِمَا عَقَّدْتُمُ الْأَيْمَانَ ۖ فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَاكِينَ مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ ۖ فَمَنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ كَفَّارَةُ أَيْمَانِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ ۚ وَاحْفَظُوا أَيْمَانَكُمْ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.","commentary":"This verse addresses believers with a strong prohibition of certain practices that were prevalent in pre-Islamic times. It declares intoxicants (like alcohol), gambling, the dedication of stones (idolatrous practices associated with stone altars), and divination by arrows (a form of seeking omens or dividing things by chance) as abominations influenced by negative forces. We are instructed to turn away from these things entirely so that we may attain success and well-being in life. This prohibition is presented as a clear directive from Allah, designed for the betterment of individuals and society.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنْصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer: will ye not then abstain?","commentary":"This verse explains the harmful consequences of intoxicants and gambling, reinforcing the prohibition mentioned in the previous verse. It highlights that these practices are tools used to create hostility and hatred among people. Furthermore, they distract from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, which are central aspects of a believer's life. By exposing the negative social and spiritual impact of these activities, the Qur'an challenges believers to consciously abandon them. The verse ends with a direct question, urging individuals to choose to abstain.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَنْ يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاءَ فِي الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَنْ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَعَنِ الصَّلَاةِ ۖ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُنْتَهُونَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and beware (of evil): if ye do turn back, know ye that it is Our Messenger's duty to proclaim (the message) in the clearest manner.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the fundamental principle of obedience in Islam: obedience to Allah and obedience to Prophet Muhammad, who conveyed Allah's message. It serves as a reminder that accepting faith implies submitting to this guidance. The verse warns against turning away from these commands and clarifies that Prophet Muhammad's role was to deliver Allah's message clearly. Therefore, if someone chooses to disregard the guidance, they bear the responsibility for their choice, as the truth has been plainly presented to them. This commandment to obey sets the context for accepting all the specific laws and prohibitions mentioned in this passage, including the previous ones about intoxicants and gambling.","arabic":"وَأَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَاحْذَرُوا ۚ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا الْبَلَاغُ الْمُبِينُ"},{"verse":"93","text":"On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past), when they guard themselves from evil, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness,- (or) again, guard themselves from evil and believe,- (or) again, guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveth those who do good.","commentary":"Following the clear prohibition of intoxicants and gambling, this verse addresses a concern some believers had about individuals who had engaged in these practices or eaten certain foods before the specific prohibitions were revealed. It assures that those who believed and did good deeds are not held accountable for past actions that were not yet forbidden at the time they occurred. The key condition mentioned repeatedly is that they must continue to be mindful of Allah, hold sincere belief, and strive to do righteous deeds. This verse emphasizes Allah's mercy and justice, confirming that accountability applies from the moment a command is revealed, and highlights the ongoing importance of faith, righteous action, and seeking Allah's pleasure.","arabic":"لَيْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُوا إِذَا مَا اتَّقَوْا وَآمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّقَوْا وَآمَنُوا ثُمَّ اتَّقَوْا وَأَحْسَنُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of game well within reach of your hands and your lances, that He may test who feareth him unseen: any who transgress thereafter, will have a grievous penalty.","commentary":"This verse shifts to a different topic, introducing a specific prohibition related to hunting during the state of pilgrimage or within sacred areas, which is elaborated in the next verse. It tells believers that Allah will test them by bringing game animals close by, making them easy to catch. This test is specifically designed to reveal who fears Allah \"unseen\" – meaning, who obeys His commands out of reverence and awe, even when no one else is watching. The verse warns that anyone who violates this prohibition after it has been made clear will face a severe consequence. This connects to the earlier theme of accepting Allah's authority to legislate and highlights the spiritual aspect of obedience based on internal fear and respect for the Divine.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ اللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِنَ الصَّيْدِ تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَرِمَاحُكُمْ لِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ مَنْ يَخَافُهُ بِالْغَيْبِ ۚ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"95","text":"O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of you doth so intentionally, the compensation is an offering, brought to the Ka'ba, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement, the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts: that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is Exalted, and Lord of Retribution.","commentary":"This verse provides the specific ruling and penalty for killing game animals while in the sacred area around Makkah or while in the state of *ihram* (the special pilgrim garb and state of consecration). It explicitly forbids this action. For intentional violations, it details a set of compensations that must be made: offering a domestic animal equivalent to the one killed (judged by two upright Muslims), or feeding the poor, or fasting for a period equivalent to the compensation value. The purpose of these penalties is stated clearly: \"that he may taste of the penalty of his deed,\" reinforcing the seriousness of violating the sacred state and place. The verse adds that past violations are forgiven (referring to actions before this rule was established), but repeating the offense will incur Allah's retribution. This provides a specific example of how Allah's laws protect the sanctity of certain times and places, linking back to the broader principles of obedience and accountability discussed earlier.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْتُلُوا الصَّيْدَ وَأَنْتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۚ وَمَنْ قَتَلَهُ مِنْكُمْ مُتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاءٌ مِثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَوْ عَدْلُ ذَٰلِكَ صِيَامًا لِيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ ۗ عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَفَ ۚ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنْتَقِمُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ"},{"verse":"96","text":"Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food,- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game;- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. And fear Allah, to Whom ye shall be gathered back.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion from the previous two verses, this verse clarifies the scope of the prohibition regarding hunting during the sacred state/area. It specifies that hunting and eating water-game (like fish) are permissible for everyone, both residents and travelers. However, it reiterates and limits the prohibition to land-game specifically while one is in the sacred precincts or in the state of *ihram*. This distinction highlights the specific nature of the restriction. The verse concludes with a reminder to fear Allah, emphasizing accountability to Him, as everyone will ultimately return to Him. This reinforces the divine source and wisdom behind these regulations and the ultimate purpose of our actions.\n\n---","arabic":"أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ صَيْدُ الْبَحْرِ وَطَعَامُهُ مَتَاعًا لَكُمْ وَلِلسَّيَّارَةِ ۖ وَحُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَيْدُ الْبَرِّ مَا دُمْتُمْ حُرُمًا ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Allah made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, an asylum of security for men, as also the Sacred Months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that mark them: That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things.","commentary":"This verse explains that Allah has made the Ka'bah, which is the sacred House of Worship in Mecca, a place of security for people. This security also extends to specific sacred months, animals brought for sacrifice, and even the markings on these animals. This highlights the importance of these elements in the Islamic tradition as symbols of peace and safety established by Allah. The verse mentions that this is so that people may know that Allah has complete knowledge of everything in the heavens and on earth. This connects the specific regulations about the sacred places and times to Allah's universal knowledge and awareness. This verse emphasizes Allah's role as the One who establishes order and security in the world through His laws and His perfect knowledge.","arabic":"جَعَلَ اللَّهُ الْكَعْبَةَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ قِيَامًا لِلنَّاسِ وَالشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ وَالْهَدْيَ وَالْقَلَائِدَ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِتَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the mention of Allah's knowledge and awareness in the previous verse, this verse serves as a reminder about Allah's attributes regarding how He deals with people. It states that Allah is strict in punishment for those who transgress or disobey, but also that He is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful towards those who repent and seek His grace. This balances the concept of accountability with the vastness of Allah's mercy, encouraging both adherence to His commands and hope for His forgiveness. This verse sets a tone of both warning and reassurance, important for understanding the subsequent verses that deal with prohibitions and responsibilities.","arabic":"اعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"99","text":"The Messenger's duty is but to proclaim (the message). But Allah knoweth all that ye reveal and ye conceal.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the role of the Messenger, Prophet Muhammad, in relation to the message revealed by Allah. It explains that his sole duty is to clearly convey the message entrusted to him from Allah. He is not responsible for making people accept it or for their inner states. The verse then reiterates Allah's perfect knowledge, stating that Allah knows everything people reveal openly and everything they keep hidden in their hearts. This reinforces the idea that ultimate accountability is to Allah, who has full knowledge of intentions and actions, linking back to the attributes mentioned in the previous verse and preparing for instructions regarding conduct and sincerity in the verses that follow.","arabic":"مَا عَلَى الرَّسُولِ إِلَّا الْبَلَاغُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Say: \"Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good, even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle thee; so fear Allah, O ye that understand; that (so) ye may prosper.\"","commentary":"This verse provides a fundamental standard for judging things in life. It declares that bad and good things are fundamentally unequal, regardless of how appealing or abundant the bad might seem. This is particularly relevant in the context of the previous verses discussing what is permissible and forbidden. Allah instructs the Prophet to convey this truth and calls upon those with understanding to be mindful of Allah and adhere to His guidance. Doing so, the verse promises, leads to true success and prosperity. This verse serves as a moral principle, urging believers not to be deceived by the superficial allure of evil or prohibited things, but to prioritize what is truly good in Allah's sight.","arabic":"قُلْ لَا يَسْتَوِي الْخَبِيثُ وَالطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ الْخَبِيثِ ۚ فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made plain to you, Allah will forgive those: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.","commentary":"Addressing the believers, this verse advises against asking unnecessary questions about matters that Allah has not explicitly detailed, especially if knowing the details might create hardship or difficulty. It notes that if questions were asked during the time the Qur'an was being revealed, specific answers might be given, potentially making things more challenging than Allah intended by leaving them general. However, Allah assures forgiveness for those who might have asked such questions out of ignorance or curiosity, emphasizing His attributes of being Oft-Forgiving and Most Forbearing. This verse guides believers towards accepting what Allah has revealed without seeking to impose stricter rules upon themselves or others through excessive inquiry into matters left unspecified.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَسْأَلُوا عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ إِنْ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ وَإِنْ تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ الْقُرْآنُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ عَفَا اللَّهُ عَنْهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"102","text":"Some people before you did ask such questions, and on that account lost their faith.","commentary":"This verse provides a cautionary example from previous communities. It highlights that some people before, by asking excessive questions about matters that were left unspecified or general, ended up overburdening themselves with obligations they could not fulfill. Their inability or unwillingness to then abide by the detailed answers they received led them to abandon their faith. This serves as a strong warning to the believers, reinforcing the instruction in the previous verse not to delve into unnecessary details about religious matters that could potentially lead to hardship or deviation. It emphasizes the importance of accepting Allah's guidance as it is revealed, without trying to add to or complicate it.","arabic":"قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُوا بِهَا كَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"It was not Allah who instituted (superstitions like those of) a slit-ear she-camel, or a she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work: It is blasphemers who invent a lie against Allah; but most of them lack wisdom.","commentary":"This verse directly challenges certain superstitious practices common in pre-Islamic Arabian society involving the dedication or treatment of specific types of animals based on myths and traditions. It explicitly states that Allah did not institute these practices. Instead, it identifies them as lies invented by those who reject the truth and wrongly attribute these customs to Allah. The verse points out that most people engaging in or following such superstitions lack true understanding or wisdom, implying that these practices are irrational and baseless deviations from divine guidance. This verse clarifies that religious laws and practices come *only* from Allah, contrasting this with human-invented superstitions and highlighting the importance of reason guided by divine revelation. This sets the stage for the next verse which addresses the rejection of Allah's guidance in favor of inherited traditions.","arabic":"مَا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ بَحِيرَةٍ وَلَا سَائِبَةٍ وَلَا وَصِيلَةٍ وَلَا حَامٍ ۙ وَلَٰكِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ ۖ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"When it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah hath revealed; come to the Messenger\": They say: \"Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following.\" what! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance?","commentary":"This verse describes the response of those who reject Allah's revealed guidance and the message brought by the Messenger. When invited to follow the path revealed by Allah and explained by the Messenger, they cling to the customs and traditions they inherited from their ancestors. This highlights a common form of resistance to divine truth – preferring familiar tradition over new guidance, even when that guidance comes from the Creator. The verse challenges this stance, questioning the wisdom of following ancestors who were themselves without true knowledge and guidance. It implicitly encourages people to use their intellect and seek guidance from Allah and His Messenger, rather than blindly following inherited practices that are not based on divine truth, building upon the critique of baseless superstitions in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ وَإِلَى الرَّسُولِ قَالُوا حَسْبُنَا مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا ۚ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"105","text":"O ye who believe! Guard your own souls: If ye follow (right) guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who stray. the goal of you all is to Allah: it is He that will show you the truth of all that ye do.","commentary":"Addressing the believers again, this verse provides reassurance and defines their primary responsibility. It instructs them to focus on guarding and purifying their own souls and adhering to the right guidance from Allah. It clarifies that if they themselves remain steadfast on the correct path, the errors or straying of others will not ultimately harm them in the sight of Allah. The verse reminds everyone that the final return and reckoning is to Allah, who knows the truth of all their actions. This verse emphasizes individual accountability and the importance of personal righteousness. However, from a broader perspective, this responsibility includes fulfilling the duties Allah has assigned, which includes sharing the guidance with others and striving for justice, as explained in the commentary. It means that while the misguidance of others doesn't detract from one's own uprightness, believers still have a duty to call others to the truth, a point elaborated upon in the commentary.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ ۖ لَا يَضُرُّكُمْ مَنْ ضَلَّ إِذَا اهْتَدَيْتُمْ ۚ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"106","text":"O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you, (take) witnesses among yourselves when making bequests,- two just men of your own (brotherhood) or others from outside if ye are journeying through the earth, and the chance of death befalls you (thus). If ye doubt (their truth), detain them both after prayer, and let them both swear by Allah: \"We wish not in this for any worldly gain, even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: we shall hide not the evidence before Allah: if we do, then behold! the sin be upon us!\"","commentary":"This verse provides specific instructions regarding witnessing a will, particularly when a believer is close to death while traveling and away from their community. It mandates having two just witnesses from their own community. However, acknowledging the circumstances of travel, it permits using two witnesses from outside their own people (potentially non-Muslims, as discussed in commentary) if necessary. It then outlines a procedure to follow if there is doubt about the witnesses' honesty. They are to be questioned and asked to swear by Allah after prayer (a moment intended to encourage sincerity), attesting that they are not seeking worldly gain, even for relatives, and that they will not conceal any evidence before Allah. This detailed instruction provides a practical legal framework within the Islamic system to ensure fairness and uphold trusts, especially in challenging situations, concluding this passage's discussion on various aspects of life regulated by Allah's law. The subsequent verses continue with the procedure if the first witnesses are suspected of dishonesty.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا شَهَادَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ حِينَ الْوَصِيَّةِ اثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ أَوْ آخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنْتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَأَصَابَتْكُمْ مُصِيبَةُ الْمَوْتِ ۚ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِنْ بَعْدِ الصَّلَاةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِاللَّهِ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ لَا نَشْتَرِي بِهِ ثَمَنًا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۙ وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَادَةَ اللَّهِ إِنَّا إِذًا لَمِنَ الْآثِمِينَ"},{"verse":"109","text":"One day will Allah gather the messengers together, and ask: \"What was the response ye received (from men to your teaching)?\" They will say: \"We have no knowledge: it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a scene from the Day of Judgment, when Allah will gather all the messengers He sent to humanity throughout history. Allah will ask them about the reception they received from the people they were sent to. The messengers, in their humility and recognition of Allah's perfect knowledge, will respond by saying they have no complete knowledge of the responses, as only Allah knows everything, including what is hidden in people's hearts. This sets a solemn stage, where accountability for the message and its reception is highlighted, and the scene transitions to focus on a specific messenger, Prophet Jesus, in the following verses.","arabic":"يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَا أُجِبْتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ"},{"verse":"110","text":"Then will Allah say: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.'","commentary":"Following the general gathering of messengers in the previous verse, this verse specifically addresses Prophet Jesus, son of Mary. Allah reminds him of the many blessings and miracles He bestowed upon him and his mother, Mary. These favors include being supported by divine power (referred to as the Holy Spirit or Gabriel), enabling him to speak clearly even as an infant and later as an adult, receiving knowledge of divine scriptures (the Book, Wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel), and performing extraordinary miracles by Allah's permission. These miracles included creating a living bird from clay, healing the blind and lepers, and even raising the dead. The verse also mentions how Allah protected Prophet Jesus from those among the Children of Israel who rejected his clear signs, accusing them of being mere magic. This reminder of Allah's direct involvement in empowering Prophet Jesus and granting him these signs is crucial context for the subsequent discussion about his status.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ اذْكُرْ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَتِكَ إِذْ أَيَّدْتُكَ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ تُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِي الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلًا ۖ وَإِذْ عَلَّمْتُكَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَالتَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنْجِيلَ ۖ وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِي فَتَنْفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِي ۖ وَتُبْرِئُ الْأَكْمَهَ وَالْأَبْرَصَ بِإِذْنِي ۖ وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ الْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِي ۖ وَإِذْ كَفَفْتُ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَنْكَ إِذْ جِئْتَهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"111","text":"\"And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Messenger: they said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to Allah as Muslims'\".","commentary":"Continuing the address to Prophet Jesus and listing Allah's favors, this verse mentions the blessing given to Prophet Jesus's closest followers, his disciples. Allah inspired them to believe in Him and His messenger, Prophet Jesus. The disciples responded by declaring their faith and asking Prophet Jesus to witness their submission to Allah. The term \"Muslims\" here refers to their state of submission to Allah's will, which is the core meaning of the word in Arabic, signifying devotion to the One True God, as taught by all prophets. This verse highlights the faith and submission of the disciples, leading into the next verses that recount a specific interaction involving them and Prophet Jesus regarding a miracle.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى الْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ آمِنُوا بِي وَبِرَسُولِي قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"112","text":"Behold! the disciples, said: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set (with viands) from heaven?\" Said Jesus: \"Fear Allah, if ye have faith.\"","commentary":"Following their declaration of faith and submission in the previous verse, the disciples, still desiring further reassurance or a unique sign, ask Prophet Jesus if his Lord—meaning Allah—is able to send down a table of food from the heavens. This question acknowledges that the power to perform such a miracle lies with Allah, not Prophet Jesus himself. Prophet Jesus responds by advising them to fear Allah if they are true believers, gently implying that seeking such a sign might not be necessary for those with strong faith. This interaction sets the stage for their explanation in the following verse and Prophet Jesus's subsequent prayer.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا مَائِدَةً مِنَ السَّمَاءِ ۖ قَالَ اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"They said: \"We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle.\"","commentary":"In this verse, the disciples explain their reasons for requesting the miraculous table of food mentioned in the previous verse. They state that their desire is to partake of the food, to find inner peace and reassurance for their hearts by witnessing the miracle, to confirm the truthfulness of Prophet Jesus's message through direct experience, and to be able to bear witness to this sign for others. This clarifies their motives, highlighting their human need for palpable proof and reassurance, which leads Prophet Jesus to supplicate to Allah on their behalf in the next verse.","arabic":"قَالُوا نُرِيدُ أَنْ نَأْكُلَ مِنْهَا وَتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُنَا وَنَعْلَمَ أَنْ قَدْ صَدَقْتَنَا وَنَكُونَ عَلَيْهَا مِنَ الشَّاهِدِينَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"Said Jesus the son of Mary: \"O Allah our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set (with viands), that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs).\"","commentary":"Responding to the disciples' request and their stated reasons (detailed in the previous two verses), Prophet Jesus, the son of Mary, turns to Allah in prayer. He addresses Allah with humility, acknowledging Him as \"our Lord,\" and asks Him to send down the table of food from the heavens. He requests that this event serve as a special occasion, like a recurring festival, for all of them—both present and future generations—and as a clear sign from Allah. He also asks Allah to provide sustenance, affirming that Allah is the ultimate and best provider. This prayer demonstrates Prophet Jesus's reliance on Allah and his role as a servant and messenger.","arabic":"قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَا أَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا مَائِدَةً مِنَ السَّمَاءِ تَكُونُ لَنَا عِيدًا لِأَوَّلِنَا وَآخِرِنَا وَآيَةً مِنْكَ ۖ وَارْزُقْنَا وَأَنْتَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ"},{"verse":"115","text":"Allah said: \"I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples.\"","commentary":"This verse records Allah's direct response to Prophet Jesus's prayer for the miraculous table of food requested by the disciples (as narrated in the preceding verses). Allah affirms that He will indeed send down the requested sign. However, this promise comes with a severe warning: if anyone among them rejects faith or disbelieves after witnessing this clear miracle, Allah will inflict upon them a punishment unlike any He has imposed on any other people in the world. This highlights the seriousness of rejecting clear divine signs and transitions the narrative towards the ultimate judgment, particularly focusing on the status of Prophet Jesus himself.","arabic":"قَالَ اللَّهُ إِنِّي مُنَزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بَعْدُ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنِّي أُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَابًا لَا أُعَذِّبُهُ أَحَدًا مِنَ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"116","text":"And behold! Allah will say: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah'?\" He will say: \"Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.","commentary":"Transitioning from the story of the miraculous meal, the verses shift to a critical question posed by Allah to Prophet Jesus on the Day of Judgment, in the presence of all of creation. Allah asks Prophet Jesus if he ever instructed people to worship him and his mother, Mary, alongside or instead of Allah. Prophet Jesus responds with profound awe and humility, immediately glorifying Allah and vehemently denying ever saying such a thing. He affirms that he would never claim something that was not his right and highlights Allah's perfect and absolute knowledge, stating that if he had said it, Allah would surely know, for Allah knows all that is hidden, while Prophet Jesus only knows what Allah allows him to know. This verse is central to affirming the Islamic belief in the absolute oneness of Allah and Prophet Jesus's status as a messenger and servant, not a deity.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنْتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَٰهَيْنِ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ ۖ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِحَقٍّ ۚ إِنْ كُنْتُ قُلْتُهُ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُ ۚ تَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِي وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِكَ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ"},{"verse":"117","text":"\"Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, to wit, 'worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things.","commentary":"Continuing his response to Allah's question from the previous verse, Prophet Jesus clarifies what he *did* say to his people. He states emphatically that he only conveyed the message that Allah commanded him to deliver: to worship Allah, who is his Lord and their Lord. This reinforces the core message of monotheism preached by all prophets. Prophet Jesus further explains that he was a witness to his people's actions only while he was physically present among them. After Allah raised him up, Allah became the ultimate Watcher over them, as Allah is a witness to all things at all times. This statement dissociates Prophet Jesus from any deviations that occurred among his followers after his time on Earth, placing responsibility and knowledge solely with Allah.","arabic":"مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ ۚ وَكُنْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا مَا دُمْتُ فِيهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيْتَنِي كُنْتَ أَنْتَ الرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَأَنْتَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ"},{"verse":"118","text":"\"If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servant: If Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise.\"","commentary":"Concluding his response to Allah's questioning about the beliefs of his followers, Prophet Jesus completely leaves the judgment and fate of his people to Allah. He states that whether Allah chooses to punish them or forgive them, they are Allah's servants, completely under His authority and will. He acknowledges that Allah's decisions are based on His absolute power (He is the Exalted in Power) and His perfect knowledge and purpose (He is the Wise). This final statement reinforces Prophet Jesus's status as a humble servant submitting entirely to the will and judgment of his Lord, Allah, without claiming any intercessory power or knowledge of their final outcome, thus further refuting any claims of his own divinity or equal status with Allah.","arabic":"إِنْ تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ ۖ وَإِنْ تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"119","text":"Allah will say: \"This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal Home: Allah well-pleased with them, and they with Allah: That is the great salvation, (the fulfilment of all desires).","commentary":"Building on the previous verses where Prophet Jesus clarifies his message and the truth about his relationship with Allah, this verse describes the outcome for those who were truthful. On the Day of Judgment, Allah declares that this is the day when truthfulness brings immense reward. Those who were sincere and truthful in their faith and actions will be granted gardens in Paradise, where rivers flow. This will be their eternal home. The ultimate reward is not just physical comfort but a state of mutual pleasure: Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with what Allah has given them. This state is described as the supreme triumph or salvation, representing the fulfillment of all their hopes and desires. This verse emphasizes the importance and benefit of upholding truth, especially concerning the core truth of Allah's oneness, as discussed earlier in the context of Prophet Jesus's message.","arabic":"قَالَ اللَّهُ هَٰذَا يَوْمُ يَنْفَعُ الصَّادِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ ۚ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ"},{"verse":"120","text":"To Allah doth belong the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, and it is He Who hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding statement to the passage and the entire Sura. After discussing the message of various prophets, particularly Prophet Jesus, and clarifying the truth about Allah's oneness and the falsehood of attributing divinity to anyone else, this verse powerfully reaffirms the absolute sovereignty and power of Allah. It declares that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs solely to Allah, and He has complete power over all things. This statement reinforces the central theme of the Sura – that guidance, authority, and judgment belong exclusively to the Sovereign Lord of all creation. It underscores that since dominion and power belong to Allah alone, worship and obedience are due only to Him, serving as a fundamental principle underlying all the teachings and directives presented in the Sura.","arabic":"لِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا فِيهِنَّ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"}];
