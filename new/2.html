    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"A. L. M.","commentary":"This verse consists of three Arabic letters. In Islamic belief, these letters, which begin several chapters of the Qur’an, are part of the divine revelation. While their exact meaning is known only to Allah, one perspective is that they highlight that the Qur’an is composed of the same letters used in the Arabic language known to its first audience. Despite this, the Qur’an is considered a miraculous and unparalleled work that humans cannot replicate, challenging anyone to produce something similar.","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah;","commentary":"Following the opening letters, this verse declares that the Qur’an is a Book of certain guidance. It is not for everyone indiscriminately, but specifically for those who are mindful of Allah (often translated as \"fear Allah\"). Being mindful of Allah means having a sensitive conscience, being alert to life's challenges and temptations, and striving to stay on the right path, much like carefully navigating a thorny road to avoid harm. This state of mind makes one receptive to the Qur’an's light and wisdom.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;","commentary":"This verse begins a description of the qualities of those who benefit from the Qur’an's guidance mentioned in the previous verse. The first quality is belief in the Unseen – matters beyond normal human perception, such as Allah Himself, angels, and the Hereafter. This belief elevates human consciousness beyond the purely physical world. The verse also mentions establishing prayer, which connects the believer directly to Allah, and spending charitably from what Allah has provided. This spending is seen as acknowledging that wealth is a trust from Allah and fosters compassion and community.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.","commentary":"Continuing the description from Verse 3, these verses describe the believers as those who accept the revelation given to Prophet Muhammad and all previous divine revelations sent to prophets before him. This highlights the Islamic belief in the unity of Allah's message throughout history. Furthermore, they have certainty in the Hereafter (the life to come), which provides a sense of purpose beyond this world and assurance of ultimate justice.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper.","commentary":"This verse concludes the description of the believers, affirming that because they possess the qualities mentioned in the preceding verses (3 and 4), they are indeed on true guidance from Allah. It states that it is these people who will ultimately be successful and prosperous. This verse serves as a direct consequence of the description of the true believers.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.","commentary":"This verse introduces a contrasting group: those who reject faith. Unlike the receptive believers described earlier, the verse states that for these individuals, warnings are ineffective. It signifies their complete unwillingness or inability to accept the truth, no matter how clearly it is presented.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنْذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).","commentary":"Following the description of the rejecters of faith in Verse 6, this verse explains their condition as a consequence of their obstinacy. It states that Allah has set a seal on their hearts and hearing and placed a veil on their eyes, meaning they are unable to comprehend or respond to guidance. This state is described as leading to a great penalty, highlighting the severe consequences of persistent rejection of truth.","arabic":"خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ ۖ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَارِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"Of the people there are some who say: \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day;\" but they do not (really) believe.","commentary":"Moving from the clear-cut categories of believers and open rejecters, this verse introduces a third group: those who claim to believe outwardly but lack sincere faith inwardly. This describes the hypocrites, whose words do not match their true state. This verse sets the stage for a more detailed examination of their behavior in the following verses.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realise (it) not!","commentary":"Expanding on the nature of the hypocrites introduced in Verse 8, this verse describes their attempt to deceive Allah and the believers. However, the verse immediately points out the futility of their efforts, stating that they are only deceiving themselves, even if they are unaware of it. It also subtly implies that Allah is aware of their intentions and protects the believers.","arabic":"يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).","commentary":"This verse explains the underlying reason for the hypocrites' behavior described in verses 8 and 9: they have a spiritual or moral \"disease\" in their hearts. The verse states that Allah increases this disease, meaning their insincerity and deceptive actions lead to a worsening of their spiritual condition. Because of their falsehood and inner sickness, they face a painful punishment, connecting their character flaws directly to their fate.","arabic":"فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"When it is said to them: \"Make not mischief on the earth,\" they say: \"Why, we only Want to make peace!\"","commentary":"This verse describes a characteristic of certain individuals, referred to as hypocrites, who appeared at the time the Qur'an was being revealed in Medina, but represent a type found in every generation. When they are asked to stop causing trouble or disruption on Earth, they falsely claim they are actually working towards peace. This highlights their deceptive nature and their twisted perception of their own actions. This verse introduces the theme of their self-deception and denial, which is further elaborated in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise (it) not.","commentary":"This verse directly refutes the claim made in the previous verse. It states clearly that these individuals are, in fact, the ones who are causing disruption, even though they do not understand or admit this reality about themselves. Their sickness of heart and lack of sincerity towards Allah distorts their view of right and wrong, leading them to believe their harmful actions are beneficial. This continues the depiction of their self-deception and adds the dimension of their being unaware of the true nature and consequences of their deeds.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"When it is said to them: \"Believe as the others believe:\" They say: \"Shall we believe as the fools believe?\" Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know.","commentary":"This verse reveals another trait of these individuals: their arrogance and contempt for sincere believers. When asked to have faith in the way others have sincerely believed, they dismiss the believers as fools. The Qur'an directly responds by stating that it is *they* who are truly the fools, precisely because they lack the awareness or insight to recognize their own misguided state. This links to the previous verses by showing how their distorted perception extends to judging others and their own understanding.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"When they meet those who believe, they say: \"We believe;\" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: \"We are really with you: We (were) only jesting.\"","commentary":"This verse exposes the double-faced behavior of these hypocritical individuals. When they encounter the sincere believers, they falsely claim to have faith, seeking acceptance and perhaps wanting to cause trouble from within the community. However, when they are in private with their close companions, described in the verse as \"evil ones,\" they reveal their true stance, affirming their loyalty to their companions and admitting their outward profession of faith was merely mockery or pretense. This illustrates their lack of sincerity and their cunning nature. The description of their companions as \"evil ones\" reflects the perspective that these allies encouraged or shared their negative behavior.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro).","commentary":"This verse describes Allah's response to the deceptive and mocking behavior of the hypocrites. It states that Allah will turn their mockery back upon them, essentially allowing their own schemes and insincerity to become their undoing. He gives them temporary leeway in their wrongdoing, but this only leads them further into misguidance, causing them to stumble blindly and lose direction. This verse serves as a stern warning about the consequences of hypocrisy and highlights Allah's power over their affairs, contrasting with their belief in their own cleverness.","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,","commentary":"This verse provides a summary of the state of the hypocrites described in the preceding verses. It uses the metaphor of a transaction, saying they have exchanged true guidance for misguidance or error. However, this trade has brought them no benefit; their endeavor is described as \"profitless,\" and they have completely lost their way. This verse underscores the ultimate failure of their path, linking their deceptive actions and arrogance to a fundamental loss of direction in life.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see.","commentary":"This verse offers the first of two parables used to illustrate the state of the hypocrites. It compares them to someone who lights a fire. For a moment, the fire provides light, enabling them to see. But then, Allah takes that light away, leaving them in complete darkness, unable to perceive anything. This reflects the hypocrites' situation: they may have had some exposure to the truth or guidance (kindling the fire), perhaps even understanding it for a time (when it lighted around them). However, because they chose to reject or turn away from it, Allah removed that light, leaving them lost in darkness. This parable emphasizes the consequence of their deliberate rejection after having had the opportunity to see.","arabic":"مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).","commentary":"Following the first parable, this verse describes the state of the hypocrites left in darkness. Having rejected the light, they are depicted as being deaf to the truth, dumb (unable or unwilling to speak it), and blind to guidance. This indicates that their rejection has led them to a state where they are no longer capable of finding their way back to the right path. Their senses, which could have been channels for receiving guidance, are effectively shut off due to their choices. This verse reinforces the hopelessness of their condition after turning away from the light.","arabic":"صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!","commentary":"This verse presents a second parable to illustrate the condition of the hypocrites. It compares their situation to being caught in a severe storm: a dark cloud with heavy rain, thunder, and lightning. The storm represents the trials, challenges, and perhaps moments of truth or warnings that come their way. The darkness, thunder, and lightning evoke fear and confusion. They react by trying to block out the terrifying sounds of thunder, fearful for their lives. This depicts their panic and desperate attempts to avoid the overwhelming reality of their situation and the consequences of their disbelief. The statement \"But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!\" serves as a reminder that they cannot escape Allah's power and ultimate judgment, emphasizing that He is fully aware of and in control of their situation, even amidst their turmoil.","arabic":"أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَاتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِمْ مِنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse continues the second parable, detailing the hypocrites' erratic behavior during the storm. The lightning flashes intensely, almost blinding them, yet provides fleeting moments of light. During these brief moments, they manage to move forward tentatively, but when the darkness returns between flashes, they stop, paralyzed by fear and uncertainty. This illustrates their unstable and inconsistent approach; they only react or move towards guidance when it's immediately apparent and seems advantageous, but freeze or turn away when faced with difficulty or uncertainty. The verse concludes by stating Allah's absolute power, noting that if He willed, He could permanently remove their ability to hear or see, reinforcing the idea that their faculties and their fate are entirely within His control. This connects back to the description of them being deaf, dumb, and blind in verse 18, showing that their state is ultimately subject to Allah's will and power.","arabic":"يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُمْ مَشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"21","text":"O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;","commentary":"This verse begins a universal call to all people. It asks everyone to worship Allah, their Creator and Sustainer. We are reminded that Allah created not only us but also all the generations before us. The purpose of this worship, according to this verse, is so that we may develop mindfulness of Allah and live righteously. It sets the stage by establishing Allah's fundamental relationship with humanity as the Creator.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).","commentary":"Following the call to worship the Creator, this verse provides reasons why Allah alone deserves worship. It highlights some of Allah's immense blessings: making the earth a comfortable and habitable place like a resting-place for us, and making the sky above us like a protective and orderly roof. It also mentions the sending down of rain from the sky, which brings forth fruits and sustenance for us. These are presented as clear signs of Allah's power and provision. Because we know these facts – that Allah is the Creator and Provider of all these things – the verse concludes with a directive not to associate partners or equals with Him in worship. This verse emphasizes recognizing Allah's unique role in creation and provision as the basis for exclusive worship.","arabic":"الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true.","commentary":"Transitioning from the call to worship based on creation, this verse addresses those who have doubts about the divine origin of the Qur’an, which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. It presents a challenge: if you doubt that this is from Allah, then produce a single chapter (Sura) that is comparable to it in quality and nature. You are invited to seek help from anyone or anything you wish, other than Allah, to meet this challenge. This is presented as a proof of the Qur’an's unique nature and source.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.","commentary":"This verse directly follows the challenge in the previous one. It asserts with certainty that the challenge (to produce a chapter like the Qur'an) cannot be met. It then presents a warning of the consequences for those who reject the truth after this evidence and challenge have been presented. It describes a fearsome punishment in the Fire, whose fuel includes people and stones, indicating its intensity. This fire is stated to be prepared for those who consciously reject faith. This verse serves as a stern reminder of accountability for rejecting the divine message.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا وَلَنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: \"Why, this is what we were fed with before,\" for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever).","commentary":"In sharp contrast to the warning of punishment for rejecters in the previous verse, this verse offers joyful news for those who believe and live righteously. It describes their reward as Gardens in Paradise, flowing with rivers. When they are given fruits there, they recognize a familiarity, saying it is like what they received before, though the reality is different. This hints at a delightful experience where things appear similar yet are uniquely pleasurable. The verse also mentions having pure companions and dwelling in this state eternally. It paints a picture of ultimate peace, joy, and permanence for the believers.","arabic":"وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِزْقًا ۙ قَالُوا هَٰذَا الَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَأُتُوا بِهِ مُتَشَابِهًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ ۖ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: \"What means Allah by this similitude?\" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-","commentary":"This verse addresses potential questions or objections raised about the use of parables or comparisons in the Qur'an, particularly those involving seemingly insignificant things (like a gnat, as later examples in the Qur'an show, although not specifically in this verse). It explains that Allah does not hesitate to use comparisons involving anything, from the smallest to the greatest, because all creation reflects His power and wisdom. It contrasts the reactions of believers and those who reject faith. Believers accept these parables as truth from Allah, understanding that there is wisdom in them. Those who reject faith, however, question the purpose of such parables, showing a lack of reverence and understanding. The verse explains that these parables serve as a test: they guide those who are receptive to truth but cause those who are already inclined to stray to drift further away. This outcome is stated to apply only to those who actively choose to forsake the path of guidance.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves.","commentary":"This verse further describes the characteristics of those who \"forsake the path\" mentioned at the end of the previous verse. These are identified as evildoers who suffer loss. Their defining traits are listed: they break the commitments they made to Allah after affirming them; they sever the connections that Allah has commanded to be maintained (which can include relationships with Allah, family ties, and bonds within humanity); and they spread corruption or disruption on earth. The verse concludes by emphasizing that the harm from these actions ultimately falls back on themselves, leading to their own loss and detriment.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَنْقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.","commentary":"This verse directly questions how anyone can reject faith in Allah when presented with undeniable facts about life itself. It points to the cycle of human existence: we were once without life, then Allah gave us life; He will cause us to die, and then He will bring us back to life again (on the Day of Resurrection). Finally, we will return to Him for accountability. This verse uses the profound and observable reality of life, death, and the promise of resurrection as a powerful sign of Allah's power and a reason to believe in Him and not reject faith.","arabic":"كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ ۖ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge.","commentary":"Building upon the theme of Allah's power in the previous verse, this one further emphasizes His role as Creator. It states that Allah created everything on Earth for our benefit, highlighting His grace and the value He has placed on humanity by making the resources of the world available to us. It then mentions His creation of the heavens, stating that His design encompassed them and He fashioned them into seven heavens, bringing order and perfection to them. The verse concludes by affirming that Allah has complete knowledge of all things. The verse mentions that Allah \"comprehended the heavens\" and \"fashioned it into seven heavens.\" In Islamic belief, such attributes are affirmed as they appear in the Qur’an, without likening Allah to His creation or explaining how they occur. Rather, they reflect His majesty and uniqueness in a way beyond human comprehension. Muslims believe Allah’s attributes are accepted as revealed, without interpreting them metaphorically or anthropomorphically. This verse serves to reinforce Allah's absolute power and knowledge over all creation, both on Earth and in the vastness of the heavens.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ ۚ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"30","text":"Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: \"I will create a vicegerent on earth.\" They said: \"Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?\" He said: \"I know what ye know not.\"","commentary":"This verse begins the narrative about the creation of humanity. Allah announced to the angels His intention to appoint a vicegerent on earth. This indicates that humanity (represented by Adam) was given a significant role to manage and develop the earth according to Allah's will. The angels responded by questioning this decision, wondering if this creation would cause corruption and bloodshed, especially since the angels already dedicate themselves entirely to praising and glorifying Allah. Allah replied by stating that He knew things the angels did not, hinting at a deeper purpose and potential within humanity that went beyond the angels' understanding at that moment. This sets the stage for understanding humanity's unique status and responsibility on earth.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\"","commentary":"Following the initial announcement and the angels' question, Allah demonstrated a key ability He bestowed upon Adam. He taught Adam the \"names\" of all things – a capacity for knowledge, cognition, and communication through symbols and language. Allah then presented these things to the angels and challenged them to identify them by name if their perspective (expressed in the previous verse) was complete. This test was to show the angels something unique about Adam's capabilities.","arabic":"وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"They said: \"Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom.\"","commentary":"In response to Allah's challenge in the previous verse, the angels humbly admitted their inability to name the things. They acknowledged that their knowledge was limited to only what Allah had taught them and affirmed that only Allah possesses perfect and comprehensive knowledge and wisdom. This highlights the angels' recognition of Allah's absolute superiority in knowledge and wisdom.","arabic":"قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"33","text":"He said: \"O Adam! Tell them their names.\" When he had told them, Allah said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?\"","commentary":"After the angels admitted their limitation (verse 32), Allah instructed Adam to tell them the names of the things. Adam was able to do so, demonstrating the special knowledge he had been granted (verse 31). Following Adam's success, Allah reminded the angels of His vast knowledge, encompassing not just what is apparent but also the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth, and even what they revealed or concealed (referring back to their earlier questioning and underlying thoughts in verse 30). This affirmed Allah's wisdom in choosing Adam for the role of vicegerent, possessing capabilities the angels did not.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.","commentary":"As a further sign of the honour bestowed upon Adam, Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before him. The angels obeyed. However, one being named Iblis (often referred to as Satan) refused out of arrogance. This act of refusal, born of pride, marked him as one who rejects faith. This verse introduces the concept of Iblis as an antagonist to humanity, stemming from his refusal to acknowledge the honour Allah gave Adam. Commentary notes that Iblis was not one of the angels but was in their company; he is described elsewhere in the Qur'an as being from the Jinn, a separate creation.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"","commentary":"After being honoured and tested, Adam and his wife were allowed to dwell in a Garden. They were given freedom to enjoy its abundant provisions, with only one prohibition: not to approach a specific tree. This single restriction served as a test of their obedience and willpower, symbolic of the boundaries set by Allah that humanity would face on Earth, without which the exercise of free will and responsibility would be meaningless.","arabic":"وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: \"Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.\"","commentary":"Satan (Iblis), having refused to honour Adam (verse 34), now actively tempted Adam and his wife, causing them to disobey Allah by approaching the forbidden tree (verse 35). This act led to their removal from the Garden, a state of happiness. Allah then decreed that they, and their descendants, would descend to Earth. This marked the beginning of human life on earth, the place appointed for humanity's role as vicegerent (verse 30). The descent also signifies the ongoing struggle between humanity and Satan, and among humans themselves (\"with enmity between yourselves\"), with Earth being their temporary home and source of sustenance.","arabic":"فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ ۖ وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Having committed the error and descended to Earth (verse 36), Adam felt remorse. In His mercy, Allah taught Adam words of repentance or prayer. When Adam used these words, Allah accepted his repentance. This highlights the concept that Allah is always ready to accept the sincere repentance of those who turn back to Him, demonstrating His attributes of being Oft-Returning (to His creation in mercy) and Most Merciful. This provides hope for humanity after making mistakes.","arabic":"فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"38","text":"We said: \"Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"Confirming humanity's dwelling on Earth (verse 36), Allah reiterated that guidance would come to them. This verse provides the fundamental promise: whoever follows Allah's guidance will be secure, free from fear and grief. It sets the condition for human success and well-being on Earth, linking it directly to adhering to the divine guidance that would be revealed.","arabic":"قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ مِنِّي هُدًى فَمَنْ تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"\"But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein.\"","commentary":"This verse presents the alternative outcome to the promise in verse 38. While following Allah's guidance leads to peace and security, rejecting faith and denying Allah's signs leads to a negative consequence. Those who choose this path will face the Fire and dwell there permanently. This establishes the ultimate consequence of choosing the path of disobedience and denial over the path of guidance offered by Allah.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, and fear none but Me.","commentary":"This verse begins a significant address in the Qur'an directed at the Children of Israel, recalling the many blessings Allah has historically granted them. It calls upon them to remember these special favors. The verse then emphasizes the importance of fulfilling their covenant with Allah. In return, Allah promises to fulfill His covenant with them. This highlights a reciprocal relationship based on obedience and remembrance. Finally, it instructs them to fear only Allah, emphasizing His ultimate authority and power, setting the stage for the commands and reminders that follow.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ"},{"verse":"41","text":"And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone.","commentary":"Building on the call to remember Allah's favors and fulfill the covenant, this verse specifically instructs the Children of Israel to believe in the revelation sent down to Prophet Muhammad. It points out that this new revelation confirms and aligns with the scriptures they already possess (like the Torah). They are urged not to be among the first to disbelieve in it. The verse warns against rejecting Allah's signs or revelations for any worldly gain or trivial benefit, describing such gain as a \"small price\" when compared to the value of faith and obedience. It reiterates the command to fear only Allah, reinforcing the message of the previous verse.","arabic":"وَآمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوا أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَإِيَّايَ فَاتَّقُونِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is).","commentary":"Following the command to believe and not trade away Allah's signs, this verse addresses specific actions. It forbids mixing truth with falsehood, which can create confusion and distort understanding. It also prohibits hiding or concealing the truth, especially when one is aware of it. The commentary suggests this refers to actions like deliberately misinterpreting their own scriptures or misleading others about the authenticity of the new revelation from Allah. It's a call for intellectual honesty and clear communication regarding divine guidance.","arabic":"وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).","commentary":"This verse invites the Children of Israel to engage in fundamental acts of worship and community life in Islam. It calls for establishing regular prayer (Salat) and giving purifying charity (Zakat - which can be understood as a form of obligatory regular charity or religious dues), which are central pillars of Islamic practice. The command to \"bow down with those who bow down\" is an invitation to join the community of believers who submit to Allah in worship, encouraging unity and shared practice. This serves as a practical invitation to integrate into the Muslim community and its way of life. This verse introduces the acts of worship that followers of Allah's message undertake.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (To practise it) yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?","commentary":"This verse transitions to a direct questioning of the Children of Israel's actions. It points out a potential inconsistency: instructing others towards righteous conduct while neglecting to practice it themselves, despite having their own scriptures that teach righteousness. This highlights the importance of aligning one's actions with one's words, particularly for those who have knowledge of religious teachings. It questions their understanding, suggesting that true understanding of scripture should lead to personal practice and consistency. This verse is a reflection on the responsibility that comes with knowledge and preaching.","arabic":"أَتَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,-","commentary":"Recognizing the difficulty in aligning words and deeds, and perhaps the challenge of accepting the new message, this verse offers guidance on finding strength. It advises seeking help from Allah through patient perseverance (sabr) and prayer. These two are presented as essential tools for facing challenges and staying firm in faith. The verse acknowledges that this path can be difficult, but notes that it is made easier for those who possess a humble spirit and are truly devoted to Allah. This provides a way forward for those who might find the previous verses' calls challenging.","arabic":"وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they are to return to Him.","commentary":"This verse describes the characteristic of those who find strength in patience and prayer (mentioned in the previous verse). They are individuals who live with the certain knowledge that they will ultimately meet their Lord, Allah, and return to Him. This awareness of accountability in the hereafter provides perspective and motivation to endure hardships, remain patient, and turn to Allah in prayer. It connects the acts of worship and patience with the belief in the afterlife and judgment.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all other (for My Message).","commentary":"Returning to a theme introduced in verse 40, this verse again addresses the Children of Israel and reminds them of the special favors Allah bestowed upon them. It explicitly mentions that, at a certain time, they were chosen and preferred by Allah to carry His message to humanity. This serves as a reminder of their historical privilege and responsibility, contrasting it with their current situation and attitude towards the new revelation. It sets the stage for recounting specific historical events where these favors were shown, which begins in the next verse.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken from her, nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).","commentary":"Following the reminder of past favors and the responsibility that came with them, this verse issues a solemn warning about the Day of Judgment. It stresses that on that day, no soul will be able to help another, intercession (seeking forgiveness or favor on behalf of another) will not be accepted, no ransom or compensation can be offered, and no external help will be available. This emphasizes individual accountability before Allah and highlights the critical importance of one's own faith and deeds in this life. It links the remembrance of Allah's past dealings with them to the ultimate consequence of their actions in the future.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.","commentary":"Beginning the enumeration of specific historical favors, this verse calls upon the Children of Israel to remember their deliverance from the tyrannical rule of Pharaoh and his people in Egypt. It vividly describes the severe suffering they endured under Pharaoh, including forced labor, harsh punishments, and the killing of their male children while sparing the females. The verse concludes by stating that this entire experience was a significant trial from Allah. This specific historical event serves as the first example in a series of reminders of Allah's grace and intervention in their history, setting the context for lessons drawn from their subsequent actions and reactions.","arabic":"وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَاكُمْ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلَاءٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"50","text":"And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people within your very sight.","commentary":"Picking up the narrative of the Israelites' journey, this verse recounts a major event: Allah's intervention to save them from the tyranny of Pharaoh. It reminds the audience of the dramatic moment when Allah caused the sea to part, creating a path for the Israelites to cross to safety, while the pursuing forces of Pharaoh were drowned before their eyes. This act is highlighted as a significant favor from Allah, a clear demonstration of His power and protection, immediately following a period of intense suffering and trial mentioned just before this verse. It emphasizes that their deliverance was a direct act of divine grace.","arabic":"وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ الْبَحْرَ فَأَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.","commentary":"Following their miraculous rescue and having received such a great favor, the narrative shifts to illustrate the Israelites' immediate response. It recalls that while Prophet Moses was away for forty nights, having been appointed by Allah to receive divine guidance, his people turned to worship a golden calf. This action is described as a severe transgression, a \"grievous wrong,\" especially poignant considering they had just been saved from a people who were idolaters themselves. This verse highlights a rapid turn from deliverance to disobedience.","arabic":"وَإِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.","commentary":"Despite the serious wrongdoing of worshipping the calf mentioned in the previous verse, this verse emphasizes Allah's immense mercy. It states that even after such a grave act of polytheism, Allah chose to forgive them. The commentary notes that this forgiveness provided them with an opportunity to show gratitude for His grace, both in saving them from Pharaoh and in pardoning their subsequent transgression. This demonstrates a pattern of divine forgiveness following human error, offering a chance for repentance and thankfulness.","arabic":"ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنْكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.","commentary":"Continuing to recount Allah's favors upon the Israelites after the incident of the calf, this verse reminds them that Allah bestowed upon Prophet Moses the Scripture – the Torah – along with the Criterion, which serves to distinguish between right and wrong, truth and falsehood. The commentary notes that this was given as a source of guidance for them. It highlights that receiving this divine law offered them a clear path to be rightly guided, presenting another opportunity for them to correct their ways and live according to Allah's commands following their pardon.","arabic":"وَإِذْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَالْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"And remember Moses said to his people: \"O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.\" Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse describes Prophet Moses's address to his people after their calf worship, conveying Allah's command for repentance and purification. Moses tells them they have greatly harmed themselves through this act and instructs them to turn back to their Creator. The severe command to \"slay yourselves\" is understood from the commentary as a stringent form of atonement, where those most responsible for the idolatry were to be executed by others within the community as a means of cleansing and purifying the whole group from the sin. This was a heavy responsibility, but necessary to preserve the community's purity. The verse concludes by stating that Allah accepted their repentance after this act, emphasizing that He is indeed the One who accepts repentance and is Most Merciful, reinforcing the theme of forgiveness mentioned earlier (Verse 52).","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ بِاتِّخَاذِكُمُ الْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوا إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ عِنْدَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"55","text":"And remember ye said: \"O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly,\" but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on.","commentary":"Despite the forgiveness and guidance they received, the narrative highlights another instance of the Israelites' challenging nature. This verse recounts how a group among them, notably the seventy chosen by Prophet Moses, made an audacious demand: they declared they would not believe unless they saw Allah directly with their own eyes. Such a demand reflects a deep lack of faith and understanding of Allah's nature. The consequence was that they were struck by a thunderbolt, leaving them as if dead, as a direct response to their inappropriate request. This incident is presented as an example of their stubbornness and is linked by the commentary to similar demands for impossible proofs made by some people towards Prophet Muhammad.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful.","commentary":"Following the severe consequence of their demand to see Allah mentioned in the previous verse (55), this verse recounts Allah's continued mercy. It states that after being struck down and left as if dead by the thunderbolt, Allah brought them back to life. This act of revival after what was akin to death was another profound sign of Allah's power and grace, offering them yet another opportunity to recognize His favors and be grateful for the life and chances He provided them.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you:\" (But they rebelled); to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.","commentary":"This verse continues the list of Allah's favors upon the Israelites during their time in the wilderness after leaving Egypt. It recalls how Allah provided them with shade from clouds to protect them from the desert heat and sent down special sustenance: Manna (a sweet, honey-like substance) and quails. These provisions were given as good things for them to eat, sustenance directly from Allah's bounty. However, the verse and commentary note that despite these continued blessings, they showed no appreciation or gratitude, instead acting rebelliously. The verse concludes by stating that their actions did not harm Allah in any way, but rather they only harmed themselves, implying that their ingratitude and disobedience ultimately deprived them of further blessings and incurred negative consequences upon their own souls.","arabic":"وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ وَالسَّلْوَىٰ ۖ كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ ۖ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"And remember We said: \"Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good.\"","commentary":"The narrative moves forward to another command given to the Israelites. They were instructed to enter a specific town (often understood to be Jerusalem, as per commentary), a place of plenty, and were told they could eat from its abundance as they desired. However, this entry came with specific instructions: they were to enter the gate with humility, showing submission in their physical posture and their spoken words. By doing so, Allah promised to forgive their sins and increase the reward for those among them who performed good deeds. This verse presents another opportunity for the Israelites to show obedience and humility and receive Allah's forgiveness and bounty.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ادْخُلُوا هَٰذِهِ الْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُوا مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَدًا وَادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُولُوا حِطَّةٌ نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَايَاكُمْ ۚ وَسَنَزِيدُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly.","commentary":"This verse recounts the consequence of the Israelites' disobedience to the command given in the previous verse (58). Instead of following the instructions to enter the town with humility and speaking the words they were commanded, the commentary notes that the wrongdoers among them deliberately substituted the words and changed the manner of entry, acting with insolence rather than humility. Because of this transgression and their repeated defiance of Allah's commands, Allah sent a plague from the heavens upon the wrongdoers as a punishment. This highlights the serious outcome of willful disobedience and altering Allah's instructions.","arabic":"فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا قَوْلًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا رِجْزًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: \"Strike the rock with thy staff.\" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.","commentary":"This verse recounts a specific event when Prophet Moses's people were in the desert and needed water. Prophet Moses prayed to Allah for them. In response, Allah instructed him to strike a rock with his staff. When he did, twelve springs gushed out from the rock, one for each tribe, ensuring everyone had access to water. This is presented as an act of Allah's grace. Following this provision, they were instructed to enjoy the sustenance Allah had provided but warned against spreading corruption on the earth. This highlights Allah's power to provide and His command for responsible behavior.","arabic":"وَإِذِ اسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبْ بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ ۖ فَانْفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا ۖ قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَشْرَبَهُمْ ۖ كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا مِنْ رِزْقِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"61","text":"And remember ye said: \"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.","commentary":"Following the account of receiving water, this verse describes another interaction. Despite being provided with food like manna and quails in the desert, the people grew tired of it and asked Prophet Moses to pray to Allah for more variety, specifically asking for vegetables like cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions. Prophet Moses responded by pointing out that they were asking to trade something superior (the specially provided food) for something common and readily available in towns. He indicated that such everyday foods could be found if they were in a settled place. The commentary explains that this incident, along with their history of rejecting Allah's signs, killing prophets, and disobeying commands, led to them incurring humiliation, misery, and Allah's wrath. This verse contrasts Allah's continuous provision with the people's ingratitude and demanding attitude.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نَصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْ بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّائِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا ۖ قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ۚ اهْبِطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَا سَأَلْتُمْ ۗ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْا وَكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse transitions from recounting specific historical events to stating a fundamental principle in Islam regarding salvation and reward. It clarifies that salvation is not exclusive to any single group based solely on their name or affiliation. Instead, it is granted to anyone who believes in Allah, believes in the Last Day, and performs righteous deeds. This applies to believers in the Qur'an (Muslims), as well as followers of the Jewish scriptures, Christians, and Sabians (understood generally as people of earlier faiths who sincerely believed and acted rightly). The verse emphasizes that those who meet these criteria will receive their reward from Allah and will have no fear or grief in the hereafter. This stands in contrast to the previous verses detailing the consequences of disobedience for the people of Prophet Moses.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالنَّصَارَىٰ وَالصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (The towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear Allah.\"","commentary":"Returning to historical accounts, this verse reminds the people of Prophet Moses about the solemn covenant Allah made with them. It mentions that Allah raised Mount Sinai above them as this covenant was given, an image emphasizing the seriousness and weight of the agreement. The command given was to hold firmly to what Allah had revealed (the Torah) and to constantly remember its contents, so that they might become God-fearing. This highlights the importance of commitment and remembrance in upholding one's pledge to Allah.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُوا مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost.","commentary":"Following the reminder of the solemn covenant in the previous verse, this verse states that despite the gravity of the pledge and the command to hold firmly to it, they turned away from it afterwards. The commentary notes that their turning away was significant, and had it not been for Allah's grace and mercy towards them, they would have been among those who are ruined or lost. This emphasizes Allah's immense mercy, even when His commands are not fully upheld.","arabic":"ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُمْ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\"","commentary":"This verse recounts another instance of disobedience, focusing on the violation of the Sabbath. Allah had designated Saturday as a day of rest for them, where they were not to work for a living. The commentary explains that they were tested by fish appearing in abundance on the Sabbath but not other days. Driven by greed, some among them found ways to circumvent the command, trapping the fish on the Sabbath but collecting them later. As a consequence for this transgression, Allah described them as becoming like \"despicable apes.\" The commentary suggests this description could imply a degradation in their nature or spirit due to their loss of self-discipline and control, rather than necessarily a physical transformation, showing how their actions debased them.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ الَّذِينَ اعْتَدَوْا مِنْكُمْ فِي السَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear Allah.","commentary":"This verse explains the purpose behind the consequence described in the previous verse regarding the Sabbath breakers. Allah made this event a clear example for the people living at that time and for future generations. It serves as a warning and a lesson, particularly for those who are God-fearing, about the consequences of disobeying Allah's commands and prioritizing worldly gain over divine directives. It connects their historical experience to a timeless lesson for believers.","arabic":"فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"And remember Moses said to his people: \"Allah commands that ye sacrifice a heifer.\" They said: \"Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?\" He said: \"Allah save me from being an ignorant (fool)!\"","commentary":"This verse begins the account of the cow (heifer) incident. Prophet Moses conveyed a simple command from Allah to his people: sacrifice a heifer. Instead of complying directly, their immediate reaction was to ask if he was making fun of them, showing a lack of trust or perhaps reluctance to accept the command. Prophet Moses responded by seeking refuge in Allah from being ignorant, indicating that mocking others, especially in the context of conveying divine commands, is an act of ignorance and unbefitting of someone who knows Allah's position. This initial exchange sets the tone for their subsequent interactions regarding this command.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُوا بَقَرَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُوًا ۖ قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is!\" He said; \"He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!\"","commentary":"Following their initial question in the previous verse, the people of Prophet Moses asked him to pray to Allah to specify what kind of heifer they should sacrifice. This shows they were making the matter more complicated than the initial command required. Prophet Moses conveyed Allah's response: the heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of an age in between. He then reiterated the command: \"Now do what you are commanded!\" The commentary notes their use of \"your Lord\" when speaking to Prophet Moses, suggesting a degree of distance or indifference on their part towards the command, and that their question indicated a lack of interest or a tendency to make light of the matter. Despite the clarification, they continued to seek more details rather than simply carrying out the task.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا فَارِضٌ وَلَا بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَافْعَلُوا مَا تُؤْمَرُونَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour.\" He said: \"He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders!\"","commentary":"Continuing the dialogue from the previous verse, the people of Prophet Moses asked for further clarification, specifically about the color of the heifer. Prophet Moses conveyed Allah's response: it should be a yellow heifer, bright and pleasing in appearance. The commentary explains that this specification further narrowed down the options and made finding the required animal more difficult. This question about color, following the question about age, illustrates their persistent questioning and tendency to make the simple divine command increasingly complex for themselves.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَاءُ فَاقِعٌ لَوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ النَّاظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the story about the command given to the Israelites to sacrifice a cow. After being told the cow should be of a specific age and color (described in previous verses), they ask Prophet Moses again to seek further clarification from Allah. They explain that many cows look similar to them, making it hard to choose, and express a hope to be guided in finding the right one, if Allah wills. This shows their ongoing difficulty and hesitation in fulfilling the simple command, leading them to ask for increasingly specific details.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ الْبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّا إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"He said: \"He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish.\" They said: \"Now hast thou brought the truth.\" Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.","commentary":"Responding to their request for more clarity in the previous verse, Prophet Moses relays the final, very specific description from Allah: the cow should be one that has not been used for farming or watering fields, and must be completely healthy and without any flaws. Upon receiving this precise description, they acknowledge that Prophet Moses has finally given them the necessary details. They then proceed to sacrifice the cow, but the commentary notes that they did so reluctantly, almost leaving it undone, highlighting their continued hesitation and lack of full willingness to obey the command despite all the clarifications.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ الْأَرْضَ وَلَا تَسْقِي الْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لَا شِيَةَ فِيهَا ۚ قَالُوا الْآنَ جِئْتَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.","commentary":"This verse reveals the reason behind the seemingly strange command to sacrifice a specific cow. The context shifts to a prior event where a man had been murdered among the Israelites, and they were arguing and blaming each other for the crime, with the true killer hidden. Allah states that He intended to expose what they were concealing, connecting the sacrifice of the cow to the resolution of this unsolved murder.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْسًا فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا ۖ وَاللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"So We said: \"Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer).\" Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand.","commentary":"Following the sacrifice of the cow (as described in Verse 71), this verse describes the divine instruction given to the Israelites: to strike the body of the murdered man with a piece of the sacrificed animal. The commentary explains that when they did this, Allah brought the dead man back to life. This miraculous act, performed using a piece of the cow, served to reveal the murderer and solve the dispute mentioned in the previous verse. The commentary emphasizes that this was a demonstration of Allah's power to bring the dead back to life and a sign for them to witness, encouraging them to understand and reflect on His capabilities and wisdom.","arabic":"فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُحْيِي اللَّهُ الْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.","commentary":"This verse reflects on the reaction and spiritual state of the Israelites *after* witnessing the incredible sign of the dead man being brought back to life using a piece of the cow. Despite seeing this clear demonstration of Allah's power and being given a solution to their problem, their hearts became hard. The verse describes their hearts as being as hard as rocks, or even harder. It uses the examples of different types of rocks – those that yield rivers, those that split to let water flow, and even those that crumble out of awe of Allah – to highlight how their hearts remained unmoved and unresponsive, unlike even inanimate rocks which can show signs of change or yielding. The verse concludes with a reminder that Allah is fully aware of all their actions.","arabic":"ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَاءُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Can ye (o ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it.","commentary":"This verse addresses the believers, prompting reflection on whether they should expect that some among the Children of Israel will accept their message. It highlights a historical pattern where some individuals from among them, even after hearing and understanding the Divine word, deliberately altered its meaning. This deliberate distortion, despite clear understanding, casts doubt on the likelihood of them embracing the new message with sincerity, suggesting a deep-seated reluctance to accept truth that contradicts their desires.","arabic":"أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: \"We believe\": But when they meet each other in private, they say: \"Shall you tell them what Allah hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?\"- Do ye not understand (their aim)?","commentary":"Following from the previous verse which mentioned distortion, this verse describes the two-faced behavior of some individuals. When they encounter believers, they outwardly claim to believe. However, in private, they express concern about revealing knowledge from their own scriptures that might support the Muslim claims, fearing it could be used against them in arguments before Allah. This illustrates a level of calculated hypocrisy and a desire to conceal truths that might validate the message brought by Prophet Muhammad. It questions the believers' understanding of this deceptive strategy.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوا أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُمْ بِمَا فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَاجُّوكُمْ بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal?","commentary":"This verse directly follows and responds to the scheming described in the previous one. It serves as a rhetorical question directed at those who plot and hide information. It emphasizes that Allah is fully aware of everything, whether it is openly declared or kept secret in their hearts and private gatherings. This reminds everyone that attempts to conceal truth or maintain hypocrisy are ultimately futile before the All-Knowing.","arabic":"أَوَلَا يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.","commentary":"Moving from the learned individuals discussed earlier, this verse introduces another group among the Children of Israel: those who are unlettered and do not truly understand their scriptures. Their understanding is based on speculation and personal desires rather than divine knowledge. This highlights that their misconceptions and expectations (as seen in subsequent verses) stem not from scriptural understanding but from wishful thinking and assumptions.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:\"This is from Allah,\" to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby.","commentary":"This verse addresses a different group, likely religious leaders or scholars, who actively manipulate and falsify their scriptures. It condemns those who deliberately write falsehoods and claim they are from Allah, doing so for worldly gain, which the verse describes as a \"miserable price.\" This is a strong warning against corrupting religious texts for personal benefit, highlighting the severe consequences both for the act of writing the falsehood and for the material profit derived from it. This contrasts with the ignorance mentioned in the previous verse by focusing on deliberate deception by the knowledgeable.","arabic":"فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"And they say: \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:\" Say: \"Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a false claim made by some among the Children of Israel: that they would only face punishment in the Fire for a limited number of days, if at all, due to a perceived special status with Allah. The response instructed here is a challenge: Do they have a specific, unbroken promise from Allah to this effect? Or are they simply making claims about Allah without any basis or knowledge? This directly questions the foundation of their assertion, suggesting it is based on unfounded assumption rather than divine revelation.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَةً ۚ قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ عَهْدًا فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ ۖ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever).","commentary":"This verse provides a definitive principle, serving as a direct refutation of the claim in the previous verse. It states clearly that eternal punishment in the Fire is for those who actively pursue evil (\"seek gain in evil\") and whose sins completely surround and engulf them. The imagery suggests that their wrongdoing has become their dominant characteristic and way of life. This establishes a universal rule of consequence for actions, overriding any claim of special privilege based on lineage or group identity.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever).","commentary":"Following the previous verse's description of the fate of evildoers, this verse presents the contrasting outcome for those who believe and perform good deeds. It states that such individuals are destined for the Garden (Paradise) and will reside there eternally. This highlights the fundamental Islamic principle that salvation and eternal bliss are attained through genuine faith accompanied by righteous actions, providing a clear contrast to the misguided claims and actions described earlier in the passage.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to remind the Children of Israel, and also inform the Muslims, about the solemn covenant Allah took from them. This covenant included fundamental principles: worshipping only Allah, showing kindness to family, orphans, and the needy, speaking courteously to all people, establishing prayer, and giving charity. However, the verse notes that despite this pledge, they largely turned away from these commitments, with only a few remaining faithful, indicating a historical pattern of breaking their promises to Allah. This serves as a prelude to discussing further violations of their covenant.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ لَا تَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion of the covenant mentioned in the previous verse, this verse highlights specific prohibitions that were part of it: they were forbidden from shedding each other's blood and from expelling their own people from their homes. It emphasizes that they formally agreed to this covenant and could even bear witness to its terms. This sets the stage for the following verses (outside this specific range) which will contrast this solemn pledge with their later actions where they engaged in violence and expulsion against their own people.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لَا تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ وَلَا تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.","commentary":"This verse highlights a pattern of behavior where some among the Children of Israel were reminded of solemn promises they made to Allah. Despite these promises, they engaged in practices like killing and exiling their own people, even assisting others against them, in violation of their covenant. Yet, if their fellow Israelites were taken captive by others, they would ransom them, which *was* in accordance with their scripture. The verse points out the contradiction in this selective adherence: believing in one part of their scripture (ransoming captives) while rejecting others (not shedding their own blood or exiling their people). The commentary explains that this behavior, observed historically among Jewish tribes in Medina allied with rival Arab tribes, led to internal conflict among them despite their shared heritage and covenant. For such actions, the verse warns of disgrace in this life and severe punishment on the Day of Judgment, emphasizing that Allah is fully aware of what they do. This verse connects to the previous ones by continuing the theme of recalling the covenant with Allah and highlighting deviations from it.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِنْ يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ ۚ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ ۚ فَمَا جَزَاءُ مَنْ يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.","commentary":"Following the description in the previous verse of violating their covenant for worldly gains, this verse explains the motivation behind such actions. It states that these people have essentially traded the blessings and rewards of the afterlife for the temporary benefits of this world. The commentary suggests this refers to actions like forming alliances that led to internal conflict and breaking divine commands, motivated by a desire for earthly power or security rather than upholding their religious obligations. The consequence for prioritizing worldly life in this manner, the verse warns, is a severe and unalleviated penalty in the hereafter, without any help or support. This verse explains the deeper spiritual cost of the selective obedience and covenant-breaking described in Verse 85.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ ۖ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!","commentary":"This verse begins by reminding the Children of Israel of the long line of divine guidance sent to them, starting with Prophet Moses, who received the Torah, and continuing with subsequent messengers, including Prophet Jesus, who was given clear signs and supported by the holy spirit (understood in Islam as the Angel Gabriel). It then directly challenges their historical reaction to these messengers. The commentary explains that despite receiving such continuous guidance, their response was often arrogance and rejection when the message did not align with their personal desires or expectations. This history included accusing some messengers of lying and even killing others. This verse sets the stage for discussing their reaction to the final messenger, Prophet Muhammad, in the verses that follow, by highlighting a recurring pattern of resistance to divine messages throughout their history.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ ۖ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"They say, \"Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah's Word: we need no more).\" Nay, Allah's curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little is it they believe.","commentary":"This verse addresses a claim made by some among the Children of Israel when called upon to accept Prophet Muhammad and the message of the Qur'an. They might say, as the commentary suggests, something to the effect of \"Our hearts are sealed\" or are sufficient with the knowledge they already possess, indicating they do not need further revelation. The verse strongly refutes this claim. The commentary explains that this was an excuse to reject Islam and Prophet Muhammad. The verse states that it is not that their hearts are inherently sealed, but rather that Allah has distanced them due to their active disbelief and rejection of truth, implying the rejection came first from them. It asserts that they possess very little genuine faith. This verse introduces their direct response to the call of Islam and exposes the weakness of their stated reasons for rejection, preparing for further challenges to their claims in the following verses.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ ۚ بَلْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلًا مَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognised, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith.","commentary":"This verse points out another inconsistency in the behavior of some among the Children of Israel regarding the advent of the Qur'an. The commentary explains that they had previously anticipated the coming of a prophet and a book that would confirm their scriptures, and had even spoken about this with the pagan Arabs, expecting that this advent would bring them victory over their enemies. However, when the Qur'an came through Prophet Muhammad, fulfilling the description of a book confirming their own scriptures, they refused to believe in it, despite recognizing its truth. The verse condemns this denial of something they knew to be true and calls down Allah's curse upon those who actively disbelieve. This highlights their denial not just as a matter of ignorance, but as a conscious rejection of a known truth, linking their past anticipation to their current denial.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُوا مِنْ قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ مَا عَرَفُوا كَفَرُوا بِهِ ۚ فَلَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.","commentary":"This verse describes the spiritual loss incurred by those who denied the revelation (the Qur'an) and identifies the underlying motive for their rejection. The commentary explains that they sold their souls for a very low price by choosing denial over faith. The primary reason given for their rejection is envy and resentment that Allah, out of His grace, chose Prophet Muhammad, one of His servants, to receive this revelation. Their refusal to accept someone chosen by Allah reflects an arrogant and narrow-minded attitude. This envy, the verse states, has caused them to incur Allah's wrath repeatedly. The commentary adds that this behavior leads to a humiliating punishment for those who reject faith. This verse exposes the internal spiritual state (envy) driving their outward rejection and emphasizes the severe consequences.","arabic":"بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَنْ يَكْفُرُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بَغْيًا أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ فَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ ۚ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ"},{"verse":"91","text":"When it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, \"they say, \"We believe in what was sent down to us:\" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: \"Why then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe?\"","commentary":"This verse presents the argument used by some among the Children of Israel when called upon to believe in the Qur'an: \"We believe in what was sent down to us,\" referring to their own scriptures. However, as the verse points out, they rejected everything else, including the Qur'an, even though it was the truth and confirmed the revelations they already possessed. The commentary highlights the inconsistency in their stance. Prophet Muhammad is instructed to challenge their claim of believing in what was sent to them by asking, \"Why then have you killed Allah's prophets in times gone by, if you were true believers?\" This powerful question, based on historical accounts within their own tradition, directly contradicts their assertion of faith in their prophets and the revelations they brought, thus leading to the next verses which provide specific examples.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُوا نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَاءَهُ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَاءَ اللَّهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully.","commentary":"Continuing the challenge posed in the previous verse (\"Why then have you killed Allah's prophets... if you were true believers?\"), this verse provides a specific example of their historical behavior that contradicts their claim of faith in what was sent to them. It reminds them that Prophet Moses came to them with clear signs and proofs of his prophethood and Allah's message. Despite this, after Moses left them temporarily, they worshipped the calf. The commentary points out that this act of worshipping something other than Allah, while Prophet Moses was still alive and after receiving clear guidance, fundamentally undermines their claim of believing in the revelations given to them. This serves as strong evidence against their assertion in Verse 91.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مُوسَىٰ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)\": They said:\" We hear, and we disobey:\" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: \"Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!\"","commentary":"This verse presents another historical example, related to Prophet Moses, that contradicts their claim of faith from Verse 91. It recalls the solemn covenant Allah took with them under Mount Sinai, an event so significant that the mountain was raised above them as a powerful reminder to take the divine law given to them with seriousness and obedience. However, their true attitude, as revealed by their actions despite their words, was captured by the statement attributed to them: \"We hear, and we disobey.\" The commentary explains that while they may have said \"We hear,\" their actions showed disobedience. The verse further describes that due to their lack of faith and earlier calf worship, the love and influence of the calf became deeply embedded in their hearts. Prophet Muhammad is then instructed to declare how awful the outcomes or implications of their so-called faith must be, if it leads them to such behavior and contradictions. This verse further exposes the shallowness of their claimed faith by referencing their historical actions and mindset, directly leading to the challenge about the hereafter in the next verse. The phrase \"made to drink the calf into their hearts\" is explained as powerful imagery illustrating the deep love and adoration for the calf, which became ingrained within them due to their faithlessness.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاسْمَعُوا ۖ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ ۚ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"Say: \"If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a claim made by some among the Children of Israel that the ultimate abode with Allah (Paradise) is exclusively for them, to the exclusion of all other people. The commentary explains that this was a way for them to assert a special status with Allah and potentially undermine the faith of Muslims. In response, Prophet Muhammad is instructed to challenge them directly: \"If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek you for death, if you are sincere.\" This challenges the sincerity of their claim. The commentary explains that if they were truly certain that the hereafter belonged to them alone and they were guaranteed a blessed end, they should eagerly look forward to death as the path to this guaranteed happiness. Their unwillingness to do so would expose the insincerity of their claim. This verse serves as a powerful challenge to their assertion of exclusive salvation, implicitly suggesting that their actions described in the preceding verses (like covenant-breaking, rejecting prophets, etc.) do not align with the behavior of those truly assured of Allah's exclusive favor in the hereafter.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ كَانَتْ لَكُمُ الدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers.","commentary":"Following a challenge in the previous verse for those who claim paradise is exclusively theirs to wish for death if their claim is true, this verse explains their unwillingness to do so. It tells us that they will never wish for death because of the deeds they have committed in this life. Their actions have led them to a state where they fear what awaits them after death. This indicates that they are aware of their wrongdoing. The verse concludes by stating that Allah has full knowledge of those who commit wrong.","arabic":"وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse about their fear of death, this verse highlights their strong desire for worldly life. It points out that they are among the most attached to life, even more so than people who do not believe in Allah. It mentions that some might wish to live for a thousand years, but emphasizes that a long life will not protect them from punishment. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's complete awareness of everything they do, reinforcing that their actions are known and accounted for.","arabic":"وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ النَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا ۚ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَنْ يُعَمَّرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the (revelation) to thy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,-","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific claim made by some that the Angel Gabriel was their enemy. It instructs Prophet Muhammad to state clearly that Gabriel delivers the revelation (the Qur'an) to his heart by the permission of Allah. It clarifies that the Qur'an confirms the scriptures revealed before it and serves as a source of guidance and good news for those who believe. This challenges the idea of enmity towards an angel who acts purely by divine command.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse which addressed the claim about enmity towards Gabriel, this verse broadens the principle. It states that anyone who shows enmity towards Allah, His angels, His messengers, and specifically mentions Gabriel and Michael, will find that Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith. It underscores the unity of belief in Allah, His messengers, and His angels, and warns that opposing any of them is a sign of rejecting faith itself, which incurs Allah's displeasure.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِلَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَالَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them but those who are perverse.","commentary":"This verse reassures Prophet Muhammad about the truth of the revelations he has received, describing them as clear signs or evidences. It then characterizes those who reject these clear signs as \"perverse\" or evildoers. This implies that rejecting such clear truth is not due to lack of clarity in the message, but rather stems from a negative disposition or resistance to accepting it. It sets the stage for the following verses which detail some of the actions stemming from this rejection.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ ۖ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَا إِلَّا الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside?- Nay, Most of them are faithless.","commentary":"Following the description of those who reject clear signs as perverse, this verse highlights a specific behavior attributed to some among the people of the Book (referring to the Israelites in this context): breaking covenants. It asks rhetorically if it is not true that whenever they make a solemn pledge, some of them break it. The verse then asserts that the reality is that most of them lack faith, suggesting that this lack of faith is the underlying reason for their inconsistency and tendency to break promises. This point leads into the next verse which gives a clear example of this behavior.","arabic":"أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُوا عَهْدًا نَبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not know!","commentary":"This verse provides a specific example of the behavior mentioned in the previous verse – the breaking of covenants and rejection of truth. It describes what happened when a messenger from Allah (Prophet Muhammad), confirming the scriptures they already possessed, came to them. Some of the people of the Book rejected this new scripture (the Qur'an), metaphorically \"throwing the Book of Allah behind their backs.\" This is depicted as a careless and dismissive act, as if they were entirely unfamiliar with such divine guidance, despite their history of receiving revelation. This shows a rejection not just of the new message, but implicitly, of the principles within their own scriptures that mandated believing in later messengers.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: \"We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme.\" They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew!","commentary":"Instead of accepting the divine revelation (the Qur'an) which confirmed their own scriptures, this verse explains that some people followed myths and false tales associated with Prophet Solomon, specifically those spread by evil ones (devils) claiming Prophet Solomon used magic. The verse clarifies that Prophet Solomon did not engage in disbelief or magic; it was the devils who were the blasphemers and taught magic to people. It mentions a historical account involving two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon. The verse states that these angels were a trial and warned people explicitly not to disbelieve by learning magic from them. Despite the warning, people learned practices, such as causing discord between a husband and wife. However, the verse stresses a fundamental principle: nothing, including magic, can cause harm except by Allah's permission. People pursuing such practices learned what was ultimately harmful to them and brought no benefit, particularly regarding the afterlife. They knew that those who engage in such dealings would have no share in the reward and happiness of the Hereafter. The verse highlights the great loss incurred by those who chose this path, describing it as selling their souls for a very low price.","arabic":"وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ ۖ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ ۖ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ ۚ وَمَا هُمْ بِضَارِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنْفَعُهُمْ ۚ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!","commentary":"Following the description of the harmful path taken by some, involving magic and disbelief, this verse presents the alternative. It states that if they had maintained their faith in Allah and His messengers, and guarded themselves against evil (specifically the evil described in the previous verse, like magic and following falsehoods), the reward they would have received from Allah would have been far better than anything they gained or sought through their actions. The phrase \"if they but knew\" implies that they did not fully grasp the immense value of faith and righteousness compared to the worthless price for which they sold their souls, as mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ ۖ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect; and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a grievous punishment.","commentary":"This verse guides believers on how to address Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It instructs them to use clear and respectful language, specifically advising against using words that could be misinterpreted or twisted to convey disrespect. The commentary explains that this advice was given in the context of some individuals from other communities using ambiguous words with potentially offensive double meanings when speaking to the Prophet. This verse highlights Allah's care and protection for the Prophet and the believers against such subtle hostility. It also includes a warning of severe consequences for those who deny the truth.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقُولُوا رَاعِنَا وَقُولُوا انْظُرْنَا وَاسْمَعُوا ۗ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"105","text":"It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord of grace abounding.","commentary":"Following the instruction on respectful communication in the previous verse, this verse addresses the attitude of some individuals from other religious groups (referred to as People of the Book) and idolaters towards the Muslims. It states that, from the perspective presented in the Qur'an, some among these groups did not wish for Muslims to receive blessings or revelations from Allah. The commentary explains that this is described as stemming from a sense of resentment or envy that Allah had chosen Prophet Muhammad and his followers for His final message. The verse affirms that Allah bestows His mercy and grace upon whom He chooses, emphasizing His boundless generosity, which is seen by Muslims as the greatest blessing.","arabic":"مَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَلَا الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَنْ يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ"},{"verse":"106","text":"None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things?","commentary":"This verse addresses questions raised about the changes or modifications made to certain religious rulings or revelations during the time of Prophet Muhammad. The commentary explains that some critics questioned the divine origin of Islam based on these changes, particularly regarding the direction of prayer (qiblah). This verse clarifies that Allah has the authority to replace or modify His revelations with something that is either better or similar, asserting His absolute power and wisdom in managing His commands for humanity. This principle is presented as a definitive statement countering such doubts.","arabic":"مَا نَنْسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنْسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا ۗ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"107","text":"Knowest thou not that to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper.","commentary":"Building on the concept of Allah's absolute authority mentioned in the previous verse regarding the replacement of revelations, this verse further emphasizes Allah's complete control and ownership over all creation – the heavens and the earth. It reminds believers that Allah alone is their protector and helper. The commentary suggests this serves as a reminder and a potential caution to Muslims, perhaps indicating that some were being affected by the criticisms from other groups and might be looking elsewhere for support or reassurance.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? but whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt from the even way.","commentary":"This verse cautions Muslims against questioning Prophet Muhammad in the manner that the people of Prophet Moses had questioned him in the past. The commentary refers back to earlier parts of the Sura which detailed the persistent questioning and disobedience of the Israelites towards Prophet Moses. This serves as a warning not to repeat similar behavior. The verse concludes with a clear statement that abandoning faith after having believed constitutes a clear deviation from the right path, linking questioning the Prophet's authority to a potential loss of faith.","arabic":"أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَسْأَلُوا رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۗ وَمَنْ يَتَبَدَّلِ الْكُفْرَ بِالْإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, Till Allah accomplish His purpose; for Allah Hath power over all things.","commentary":"Returning to the theme of the attitude of other religious groups, this verse states that, from the Qur'anic perspective, many among the People of the Book desired for the Muslims to abandon their faith and return to disbelief. The commentary explains that this is described as being motivated by deep-seated resentment and envy, even after the truth of Islam had become clear to them. In the face of this perceived hostility and plotting, the verse instructs Muslims to respond with forgiveness and forbearance, trusting that Allah will ultimately bring about His intended outcome, reaffirming Allah's absolute power.","arabic":"وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ ۖ فَاعْفُوا وَاصْفَحُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"110","text":"And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allah sees Well all that ye do.","commentary":"Following the instructions to deal with external challenges through patience and forgiveness, this verse directs believers towards strengthening their internal faith and community by emphasizing core Islamic practices. It commands steadfastness in prayer and giving regular charity (zakat). The commentary explains that these practices are ways for Muslims to connect with Allah and invest their efforts in actions that will benefit them in the afterlife. The verse provides reassurance that all good deeds are known to and recorded by Allah, encouraging Muslims to focus on their relationship with Him and their righteous conduct as a means of resilience and spiritual growth.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"111","text":"And they say: \"None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.\" Those are their (vain) desires. Say: \"Produce your proof if ye are truthful.\"","commentary":"Moving from instructions for believers, the Sura now addresses claims made by some individuals from Jewish and Christian communities regarding salvation. This verse states that these individuals claimed that only those who identified as Jews or Christians would enter Paradise. The commentary explains that this reflects a claim of exclusive salvation. The verse dismisses these claims as mere assertions and challenges them to produce proof or evidence to support their statement, highlighting the principle that such significant claims require substantiation.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"112","text":"Nay,-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse directly refutes the exclusive claims made in the previous verse (111) and establishes a fundamental principle in Islam regarding salvation and reward. It states that anyone who completely submits themselves to Allah and performs good deeds will receive their reward from their Lord. The commentary clarifies that salvation is based on sincere submission to Allah and righteous actions, not on affiliation with a particular group or lineage. It emphasizes that true faith is expressed through both internal conviction and outward good deeds, leading to a state where believers will have no fear or grief in the Hereafter.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"The Jews say: \"The Christians have naught (to stand) upon; and the Christians say: \"The Jews have naught (To stand) upon.\" Yet they (Profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment.","commentary":"This verse points out the disagreements and mutual criticisms between some individuals within the Jewish and Christian communities, where each group accused the other of lacking a valid foundation for their beliefs. The commentary notes that despite these mutual accusations, both groups claimed to follow scriptures revealed by Allah. It draws a parallel between these disputes and the statements made by those \"devoid of knowledge\" (identified in the commentary as the Arab idolaters) who observed these disagreements and dismissed both. The verse concludes by stating that Allah will be the ultimate judge of their disputes on the Day of Judgment, emphasizing that the final arbitration of such matters rests with Allah alone.","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ ۚ فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah, Allah's name should be celebrated?-whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment.","commentary":"This verse highlights the great injustice of those who prevent others from remembering Allah's name in places of worship or who actively seek to damage or destroy these places. The commentary connects this to actions taken by some groups during the Prophet Muhammad's time who opposed Muslims praying towards the Ka'bah in Makkah, seeing it as hindering worship in a sacred place. It explains that such actions are deeply wrong and those who commit them deserve consequences both in this life and the next. The phrase \"It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear\" can be understood as a statement that such individuals should only approach places of worship with reverence and awe for Allah's presence, not with hostile intent.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ مَنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ أَنْ يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ وَسَعَىٰ فِي خَرَابِهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَنْ يَدْخُلُوهَا إِلَّا خَائِفِينَ ۚ لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"115","text":"To Allah belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence of Allah. For Allah is all-Pervading, all-Knowing.","commentary":"This verse follows up on the discussion of places and directions of worship. It emphasizes Allah's boundless nature, stating that He is present everywhere, encompassing the entire universe from east to west. The commentary explains that this verse offers reassurance regarding the validity of prayer direction, especially in the context of the change in the direction Muslims faced during prayer. It clarifies that while a specific direction may be designated for unity and discipline, Allah Himself is not confined to any single place. Wherever one turns in sincere devotion, they are turning towards Allah's presence. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's limitless bounty and His complete knowledge of all things, ensuring that sincere devotion, regardless of direction, is known and accepted by Him. Regarding the phrase \"there is the presence of Allah\" or \"face of Allah\" used in some translations, Muslims affirm this attribute as it appears in the Qur’an, without likening Allah to His creation or explaining how it occurs. Rather, it reflects His majesty and uniqueness in a way beyond human comprehension. Muslims believe Allah’s attributes are accepted as revealed, without interpreting them metaphorically or anthropomorphically.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ ۚ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّوا فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"116","text":"They say: \"Allah hath begotten a son\": Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him.","commentary":"This verse addresses a misconception held by some groups who claimed that Allah has a son. The commentary notes that this idea was present among Christians, some Jews who held a similar belief about Prophet Ezra, and some Arab idolaters who considered angels to be daughters of Allah. The verse strongly refutes this idea, declaring \"Glory be to Him!\" to emphasize Allah's absolute transcendence and freedom from any human-like relationships or limitations. It asserts that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah and is subservient to Him, highlighting His unique sovereignty and the fact that He does not need offspring or partners.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا ۗ سُبْحَانَهُ ۖ بَلْ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ كُلٌّ لَهُ قَانِتُونَ"},{"verse":"117","text":"To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: \"Be,\" and it is.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of Allah's unique nature and power, this verse further explains that Allah is the sole Originator of everything in the universe. It describes His absolute power of creation: when He decides something is to exist, He simply says \"Be,\" and it comes into being instantly. The commentary explains this reflects Allah's direct, absolute, and omnipotent will in creation, without needing intermediaries. This concept reinforces the idea of Allah's uniqueness and refutes any notion of Him having a son or partners, as His creative power is absolute and immediate.","arabic":"بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ"},{"verse":"118","text":"Say those without knowledge: \"Why speaketh not Allah unto us? or why cometh not unto us a Sign?\" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts).","commentary":"This verse speaks about people who lack true understanding and challenge why Allah does not speak directly to them or show them specific miraculous signs. The commentary notes that this attitude is not new and that previous nations made similar demands of their prophets, such as when the Israelites asked Prophet Moses to see Allah directly. The verse points out that the hearts and attitudes of those who make such demands are similar across different times. It then clarifies that Allah has indeed provided clear signs, but these signs are most apparent and beneficial to those who already possess sincere faith and conviction in their hearts. Faith enables one to recognize and appreciate the meaning and purpose of these signs.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلَا يُكَلِّمُنَا اللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَا آيَةٌ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ ۘ تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۗ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"119","text":"Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of the Blazing Fire.","commentary":"Addressing Prophet Muhammad, this verse defines his role and responsibilities. It states that he has been sent with the truth as someone who gives good news to those who believe and obey Allah, and who warns those who reject His message. The commentary explains that the Prophet's mission is to convey this message. He is not held accountable for the ultimate fate of those who choose to disbelieve and are destined for punishment; their outcome is a consequence of their own choices.","arabic":"إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِالْحَقِّ بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا ۖ وَلَا تُسْأَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِ الْجَحِيمِ"},{"verse":"120","text":"Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: \"The Guidance of Allah,-that is the (only) Guidance.\" Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah.","commentary":"This verse reveals the deep-seated desire of some among the Jews and Christians during that time for Prophet Muhammad to abandon his faith and adopt theirs. It states that they would not be satisfied with him unless he followed their religious path. The commentary highlights that this was not necessarily a matter of seeking proof or understanding but a fundamental difference in religious identity and belief. The verse instructs the Prophet to state clearly that \"The Guidance of Allah—that is the (only) Guidance,\" emphasizing that the true and complete guidance comes solely from Allah. It sternly warns the Prophet (and by extension, Muslims) against compromising their faith or following the desires of others after having received divine knowledge, stating that doing so would leave them without protection or help from Allah.","arabic":"وَلَنْ تَرْضَىٰ عَنْكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ ۗ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ بَعْدَ الَّذِي جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ ۙ مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ"},{"verse":"121","text":"Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied: They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss is their own.","commentary":"Following the warning in the previous verse, this verse distinguishes between those who have received divine scripture. It states that those who study and understand their scriptures properly and sincerely are the ones who truly believe, implying that a genuine engagement with divine revelation leads to faith. Conversely, those who reject faith after receiving the scripture are described as suffering their own loss. The commentary suggests that some among the People of the Book, if they were to approach their own scriptures with sincerity and understanding, might find confirmation of the truth brought by Prophet Muhammad.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِ أُولَٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"122","text":"O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for My Message).","commentary":"This verse is a direct address to the Children of Israel (descendants of Prophet Jacob, also known as Israel). It serves as a reminder of the many favors and blessings Allah had bestowed upon them throughout their history. The commentary notes that this is a final appeal to them within this discussion, urging them to remember the special status they were given as recipients and carriers of Allah's message in the past. This reminder sets the stage for the warning that follows.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"123","text":"Then guard yourselves against a Day when one soul shall not avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).","commentary":"Concluding the appeal to the Children of Israel and the broader discussion, this verse delivers a solemn warning about the Day of Judgment. It emphasizes that on that Day, each soul will be accountable for its own actions. No other soul will be able to help another, no ransom or compensation will be accepted, intercession will not be beneficial without Allah's permission (which the verse implies is not generally available in this context of accountability), and no external help will be available. The commentary highlights that this serves as a crucial reminder that past favors or lineage will not provide salvation; rather, individual accountability for one's deeds before Allah is the sole determinant on that formidable Day.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا تَنْفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"124","text":"And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: \"I will make thee an Imam to the Nations.\" He pleaded: \"And also (Imams) from my offspring!\" He answered: \"But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers.\"","commentary":"This verse reminds us of Prophet Abraham, a highly respected figure in Islam. It tells us that Allah tested him with specific instructions, and he successfully carried them out. Because of his faithfulness, Allah told him that He would make him a leader for all of humanity, someone to be followed as an example of goodness. Prophet Abraham, being human, then asked if this blessing and leadership would also extend to his descendants. Allah replied that His promise of leadership would not include those who do wrong. This highlights a key principle: closeness to Allah and leadership in faith are based on genuine belief and righteous actions, not just on family lineage or ancestry. Those who deviate from doing good and associate partners with Allah or harm others are not included in this promise of leadership.","arabic":"وَإِذِ ابْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"125","text":"Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).","commentary":"Following the mention of Prophet Abraham's status, this verse speaks about the Ka'bah in Makkah, a central and sacred building for Muslims. It tells us that Allah designated this House as a gathering place and a sanctuary for people, where they should find peace and security. Muslims are instructed to take the place where Prophet Abraham stood as a place for prayer. The verse also mentions a covenant made with Prophet Abraham and his son, Prophet Ishmael. They were tasked with purifying this House, making it ready and sacred for those who would come to perform various acts of worship there, such as circling it, staying for spiritual devotion, or praying by bowing and prostrating. This shows the historical significance of the Ka'bah as a place dedicated to the worship of Allah from the time of Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ishmael.","arabic":"وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِنْ مَقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَنْ طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ"},{"verse":"126","text":"And remember Abraham said: \"My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.\" He said: \"(Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while will I grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire,- an evil destination (indeed)!\"","commentary":"This verse continues the account related to the Ka'bah and the city of Makkah. We hear Prophet Abraham praying for the city to become a place of peace and security, and asking Allah to provide its people with sustenance. Importantly, his prayer for provision specifically mentioned \"such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.\" This seems to reflect his understanding, perhaps from the guidance in verse 124, that Allah's ultimate blessings and covenant are for the believers. Allah's response shows His vast mercy, stating that He will provide enjoyment in this life even for those who reject faith, but ultimately their destination will be the Fire. This verse connects to the previous ones by showing Prophet Abraham's concern for the future of the place and its inhabitants after he and Prophet Ishmael built the Ka'bah.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا وَارْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ مَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۖ قَالَ وَمَنْ كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلًا ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ النَّارِ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"127","text":"And remember Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House (With this prayer): \"Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-knowing.","commentary":"This verse brings us directly into the scene of Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ishmael working together to raise the foundations of the Ka'bah. While engaged in this momentous task, they offered a heartfelt prayer. Their first request was that Allah accept this service from them. They acknowledged Allah as the All-Hearing and the All-Knowing, recognizing that He hears their prayer and is fully aware of their intentions and efforts. This shows their humility and their dedication to doing the work purely for Allah's pleasure, hoping for His acceptance. This prayer begins a series of supplications recorded in the following verses, all made while they were building the sacred House.","arabic":"وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ الْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ الْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"128","text":"\"Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (will); and show us our place for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for Thou art the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Continuing their prayer while building the Ka'bah, Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ishmael asked Allah to make them people who submit fully to His will – this is the meaning of \"Muslim\" in Arabic. They also prayed for their descendants to be a community that submits to Allah's will. This shows their deep concern that the faith would continue through their lineage. They further asked Allah to guide them and show them the correct ways to perform the religious rites. Finally, they prayed for Allah's mercy and forgiveness, acknowledging that Allah is the Oft-Returning (accepting repentance) and Most Merciful. This part of the prayer emphasizes the importance of submission to Allah and the desire for future generations to uphold this faith.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا وَاجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِنَا أُمَّةً مُسْلِمَةً لَكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"129","text":"\"Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"","commentary":"Concluding their prayer while building the Ka'bah, Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ishmael made a specific request for their future descendants. They asked Allah to send a Messenger from among their own people who would recite Allah's revelations to them, teach them the scripture and wisdom, and purify them. They acknowledged Allah's power and wisdom in this request, stating He is the Exalted in Might and the Wise. Muslims understand this prayer as a prophecy and a request for the coming of Prophet Muhammad, who was a direct descendant of Prophet Ishmael and was sent to teach and purify humanity. This prayer, made during the building of the Ka'bah, highlights the continuity of the message of submission to Allah through the line of Abraham and Ishmael.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا وَابْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِنْهُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"130","text":"And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world: And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus slightly to emphasize the importance and clarity of Prophet Abraham's faith. It asks rhetorically who would turn away from his religion except someone who has foolishly degraded themselves. Prophet Abraham's religion was fundamentally about pure submission to Allah, which is what the word \"Islam\" means. The verse reaffirms Prophet Abraham's high status, stating that Allah chose him, purified him in this life, and that he will be among the righteous in the Hereafter. This serves as a strong statement about the true nature of Prophet Abraham's faith, contrasting it with any later deviations or claims.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَرْغَبُ عَنْ مِلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلَّا مَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ ۚ وَلَقَدِ اصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"131","text":"Behold! his Lord said to him: \"Bow (thy will to Me):\" He said: \"I bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.\"","commentary":"Following the statement about Prophet Abraham's faith, this verse gives a direct example of his pure submission. It recounts a moment when Allah commanded him to \"Submit\" or \"Bow your will to Me.\" Prophet Abraham's immediate and complete response was, \"I submit my will to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.\" This simple yet profound exchange perfectly illustrates the essence of his faith – total and willing surrender to the Creator and Sustainer of everything that exists.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ ۖ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"132","text":"And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; \"Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.\"","commentary":"This verse shows how the faith of pure submission (Islam) was passed down through generations. It states that Prophet Abraham left this faith as a legacy to his sons. Similarly, his grandson, Prophet Jacob (also known as Israel), left the same counsel to his children. Their message was a strong urging: \"Allah has chosen this Faith for you; therefore, make sure you do not die except in a state of submission to Allah.\" This emphasizes that the religion of submission was not just for them, but was intended to be a continuous inheritance for their descendants, stressing its divine origin and importance until the very end of life. This connects directly to Prophet Abraham's own example of submission shown in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَا بَنِيَّ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ الدِّينَ فَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"133","text":"Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons: \"What will ye worship after me?\" They said: \"We shall worship Thy god and the god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il and Isaac,- the one (True) Allah: To Him we bow (in Islam).\"","commentary":"This verse paints a powerful and moving scene of Prophet Jacob on his deathbed. Addressing people who lived much later, the verse uses a rhetorical question, \"Were you witnesses...?\", to emphasize the truth of the event it describes. Prophet Jacob's greatest concern as his life was ending was the faith his children would follow. He asked them directly, \"Whom will you worship after me?\" Their reply was a source of great reassurance: they declared they would worship the same God he worshipped, the God of his fathers, Prophet Abraham, Prophet Ishmael, and Prophet Isaac – the one true Allah. They affirmed their commitment, saying, \"To Him we bow (in Islam),\" meaning they submit to Allah. This verse shows the strong chain of faith passed down from Prophet Abraham through Prophet Isaac and Prophet Jacob, with the children affirming their commitment to the pure submission to Allah, linking them to the legacy mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"أَمْ كُنْتُمْ شُهَدَاءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ بَعْدِي قَالُوا نَعْبُدُ إِلَٰهَكَ وَإِلَٰهَ آبَائِكَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"134","text":"That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case!","commentary":"Following the historical accounts of Prophet Jacob and his children affirming their commitment to Allah, this verse draws a clear distinction. It emphasizes that past generations, like the descendants of Jacob mentioned before, are accountable only for their own actions. Their deeds, good or bad, are recorded for them. Similarly, the current generation, or any generation, is responsible for what they do. You will not be questioned about what previous people did. This highlights a core principle in Islam: accountability is individual, based on one's own faith and actions, not on the lineage or history of one's ancestors. It sets the stage for the discussion that follows about the true basis of faith.","arabic":"تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ ۖ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ ۖ وَلَا تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"135","text":"They say: \"Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To salvation).\" Say thou: \"Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with Allah.\"","commentary":"Building on the idea of individual accountability rather than inherited merit, this verse addresses the claims made by some people from earlier religious communities who were saying that others needed to adopt their specific religious path to be guided. Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad to respond by stating that the true path is the way of Prophet Abraham, who was purely devoted to Allah alone and did not associate partners with Him. This links the faith of Muslims directly back to Prophet Abraham, emphasizing that the core message throughout time has been the pure worship of Allah alone. It provides a counter-argument to claims of exclusive truth based on later religious developments.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تَهْتَدُوا ۗ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۖ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"136","text":"Say ye: \"We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam).\"","commentary":"This verse outlines the comprehensive belief held by Muslims. We declare belief in Allah, in the revelation given to Prophet Muhammad (the Qur'an), and in the revelations given to all the prophets who came before him, including Prophet Abraham, Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Isaac, Prophet Jacob, the tribes who descended from Jacob, Prophet Moses, and Prophet Jesus, as well as all other prophets sent by Allah. A key principle here is that Muslims believe in and respect all of Allah's prophets, making no distinction between them in terms of accepting their divine mission. This universal acceptance of prophets and revelations is central to Islam and signifies submission to Allah alone. This statement follows the call to follow Abraham's path by detailing what that encompasses – belief in the continuity of divine guidance through all prophets.","arabic":"قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"137","text":"So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but Allah will suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.","commentary":"Following the declaration of belief in all prophets and revelations, this verse presents the outcome of accepting or rejecting this unified understanding of faith. It states that if others accept this belief in Allah and all His messengers, just as Muslims do, then they are rightly guided. However, if they turn away from this comprehensive belief, they are creating a division or separation from the core truth. The verse offers reassurance, stating that Allah is sufficient to protect the Prophet and the believers against such opposition. He hears all and knows all, meaning He is aware of their disputes and will deal with them justly. This verse connects the statement of belief to its practical consequence: unity for those who accept, and division for those who reject.","arabic":"فَإِنْ آمَنُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَوْا ۖ وَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِي شِقَاقٍ ۖ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"138","text":"(Our religion is) the Baptism of Allah: And who can baptize better than Allah? And it is He Whom we worship.","commentary":"This verse describes the faith as having a distinct \"color\" or \"hue\" from Allah. It signifies that the religion originates from Allah, giving it a unique and pure quality that surpasses anything else. It is like a spiritual dye or purification that comes directly from the Divine Source. The verse poses a rhetorical question: who can give a better 'color' or purification than Allah? This emphasizes that the true worship and submission are to Allah alone, the One from whom this unique spiritual identity is derived. The commentary notes a unique aspect of the Qur'anic style here, where a statement from Allah about the faith's divine origin is immediately followed by the believers' declaration of worshiping Him alone, indicating their close connection to Him.","arabic":"صِبْغَةَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ اللَّهِ صِبْغَةً ۖ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ عَابِدُونَ"},{"verse":"139","text":"Say: Will ye dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him?","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion, challenging any attempt to dispute the fundamental truth about Allah. It points out the illogical nature of arguing about Allah, since He is acknowledged as the Lord of everyone, both Muslims and others. It reiterates the principle of individual accountability introduced in Verse 134 – that each person is responsible for their own actions. The verse also emphasizes the sincerity of the believers' devotion to Allah alone. By highlighting these shared points (Allah as Lord) and key Islamic principles (individual deeds, sincere devotion), it addresses the basis of religious difference.","arabic":"قُلْ أَتُحَاجُّونَنَا فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ وَلَنَا أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُخْلِصُونَ"},{"verse":"140","text":"Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah? but Allah is not unmindful of what ye do!","commentary":"This verse poses a direct question to those who might claim that the early prophets like Prophet Abraham, Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Isaac, Prophet Jacob, and the Tribes were followers of Judaism or Christianity. It points out that these prophets lived long before Judaism and Christianity were established as distinct religions. Therefore, claiming they belonged to these later faiths is historically inaccurate. The verse then asks rhetorically, \"Do you know better than Allah?\", challenging their assertion against divine knowledge. It then highlights the great wrong committed by those who hide or distort truth that has come from Allah, concluding with a reminder that Allah is fully aware of everything people do, including concealing truth. This verse strengthens the argument made in Verse 135 about following the pure faith of Abraham, distinguishing it from later religious labels.","arabic":"أَمْ تَقُولُونَ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطَ كَانُوا هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ قُلْ أَأَنْتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ اللَّهُ ۗ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَتَمَ شَهَادَةً عِنْدَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"141","text":"That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case:","commentary":"This verse repeats the statement made in Verse 134. By repeating it after the discussion about the prophets and the claims of later religious groups, it powerfully reinforces the central theme: lineage or historical association does not guarantee salvation or special status. The deeds of those past generations are for them, and your deeds are for you. You are not responsible for their actions, nor do their merits automatically benefit you. This serves as a concluding statement to this section, bringing the argument back to the core Islamic principle of individual accountability before Allah, separate from ancestral or historical group identity.","arabic":"تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ ۖ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ ۖ وَلَا تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"142","text":"The fools among the people will say: \"What hath turned them from the Qibla to which they were used?\" Say: To Allah belong both east and West: He guideth whom He will to a Way that is straight.","commentary":"This verse anticipates questions that people might raise about a change in the direction Muslims face during prayer. Previously, Muslims in Madinah prayed facing Jerusalem, which was also the direction for Jewish and Christian prayer. This verse refers to those who might question why Muslims would change this direction. It directs Prophet Muhammad to respond by stating that all directions, east and west, belong to Allah. This emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and that He guides whomever He wills to the correct path. The significance of a direction for prayer (Qibla) comes from Allah's designation, not from any inherent quality of the direction itself. This serves to immediately address potential objections and set the stage for the subsequent verses.","arabic":"سَيَقُولُ السُّفَهَاءُ مِنَ النَّاسِ مَا وَلَّاهُمْ عَنْ قِبْلَتِهِمُ الَّتِي كَانُوا عَلَيْهَا ۚ قُلْ لِلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ ۚ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"143","text":"Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse connects the change in the direction of prayer (Qibla) to the identity and role of the Muslim community, called an *Ummah* in the Qur'an. Allah states that He has made this community a \"justly balanced Ummah.\" This means they are meant to be moderate, upright, and a model for humanity, positioned to bear witness to truth and justice among all people. Prophet Muhammad serves as a witness over this community, guiding and setting the standard for their actions and beliefs. The verse then clarifies that the *previous* direction of prayer (Jerusalem) was a test. It was intended to distinguish those who truly followed the Messenger from those whose faith was shallow. This change was difficult, except for those whom Allah guided. The verse reassures believers that Allah would never cause their earlier prayers or their faith to be wasted, confirming His compassion and mercy.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا ۗ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِي كُنْتَ عَلَيْهَا إِلَّا لِنَعْلَمَ مَنْ يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّنْ يَنْقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ ۚ وَإِنْ كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلَّا عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ ۗ وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"144","text":"We see the turning of thy face (for guidance to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do.","commentary":"This verse describes Prophet Muhammad's unspoken desire for a different direction of prayer, showing him looking towards the heavens. Allah acknowledges this desire and states that He will now turn him to a Qibla that will be pleasing to him. This new, permanent direction is specified as the Sacred Mosque (the Ka'bah) in Mecca. The instruction is universal: wherever Muslims are, they should turn their faces towards this direction in prayer. The verse adds that the people who received earlier revelations (referred to as \"people of the Book\") know that this designation is the truth from their Lord, implying its historical and religious significance. It also assures believers that Allah is fully aware of the actions of all. This verse marks the formal institution of the Ka'bah as the permanent Qibla for Muslims worldwide.","arabic":"قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ ۗ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"145","text":"Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs (together), they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain) desires,-then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.","commentary":"Following the instruction to face the Sacred Mosque, this verse addresses the differing perspectives and challenges that arose. It states that even if Prophet Muhammad were to present every possible sign, the people of earlier revelations would not follow the Muslim Qibla. It also makes it clear that the Prophet is not to follow their Qibla. Furthermore, it highlights that even among themselves, the various groups among the people of earlier revelations do not agree on a single direction for prayer. The verse concludes with a strong warning to the Prophet (and by extension, to all Muslims) that following the desires of others after receiving clear knowledge from Allah would be a clear deviation from the right path. This emphasizes the distinct identity of the Muslim faith and the importance of adhering strictly to divine guidance.","arabic":"وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَا تَبِعُوا قِبْلَتَكَ ۚ وَمَا أَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ ۚ وَمَا بَعْضُهُمْ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ ۚ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ ۙ إِنَّكَ إِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"146","text":"The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know.","commentary":"This verse asserts that the people who received earlier revelations have certain knowledge about the truth of Prophet Muhammad's message, including the significance of the Sacred Mosque. It uses a powerful comparison, saying they know it as surely as they know their own children. Despite this inner conviction, the verse points out that some among them intentionally hide or distort this truth. This explains why, as mentioned in the previous verse, they would not accept or follow the Muslim Qibla, despite their knowledge.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ ۖ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقًا مِنْهُمْ لَيَكْتُمُونَ الْحَقَّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"147","text":"The Truth is from thy Lord; so be not at all in doubt.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses Prophet Muhammad, reinforcing the message from the previous verses. It confirms that the truth regarding the change of Qibla, and all other matters revealed, originates solely from Allah. It instructs the Prophet to have no doubt whatsoever about this truth. While this is addressed to the Prophet, it serves as a reassurance for all believers and a clear statement against any doubts that might have been stirred by the discussions and challenges raised by others. It emphasizes the ultimate authority and certainty of Allah's revelation.","arabic":"الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۖ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"148","text":"To each is a goal to which Allah turns him; then strive together (as in a race) Towards all that is good. Wheresoever ye are, Allah will bring you Together. For Allah Hath power over all things.","commentary":"After addressing the specific issue of the Qibla and the differing perspectives, this verse offers a broader perspective. It acknowledges that different communities may have different goals or directions they turn towards. However, it then immediately shifts the focus for Muslims: instead of being distracted by these differences or engaging in futile arguments, they are urged to compete with one another in doing good deeds. This redirects their energy towards positive action and moral excellence. It reassures them that no matter where they are, Allah has the power to bring them together, emphasizing the unity of the Muslim community and Allah's complete power over all things.","arabic":"وَلِكُلٍّ وِجْهَةٌ هُوَ مُوَلِّيهَا ۖ فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ ۚ أَيْنَ مَا تَكُونُوا يَأْتِ بِكُمُ اللَّهُ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"149","text":"From whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; that is indeed the truth from the Lord. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.","commentary":"This verse reiterates the command given in Verse 144 regarding the direction of prayer. It emphasizes again, \"From wherever you may come forth,\" meaning from any location or starting point, Prophet Muhammad and thus all Muslims are to turn their face towards the Sacred Mosque during prayer. It stresses that this is undeniably \"the truth from your Lord.\" The verse concludes by reminding believers that Allah is fully aware of everything they do, serving as a reminder of accountability and sincerity in following His commands. This repetition underscores the importance and finality of this instruction.","arabic":"وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۖ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"150","text":"So from whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; and wheresoever ye are, Turn your face thither: that there be no ground of dispute against you among the people, except those of them that are bent on wickedness; so fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favours on you, and ye May (consent to) be guided;","commentary":"This is the third time the instruction to face the Sacred Mosque in prayer is given, highlighting its significance. This repetition includes the general directive for all Muslims, wherever they are, to turn towards it. A key reason given here is \"that people may have no argument against you.\" By having a clear and universally designated Qibla rooted in the heritage of Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ishmael, Muslims remove any valid grounds for others to question their direction of worship. The verse notes that only those determined to find fault will continue to raise arguments. It then advises Muslims not to fear these detractors but to fear Allah alone. This is linked to Allah completing His blessings upon them and guiding them fully. This verse emphasizes the establishment of a distinct Muslim identity and the protection and guidance Allah provides to those who obey Him.","arabic":"وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِي وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"151","text":"A similar (favour have ye already received) in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus slightly but remains connected to the theme of Allah's favor upon the Muslim community, which was mentioned at the end of the previous verse. It reminds them of a great blessing already bestowed: the sending of a Messenger, Prophet Muhammad, from among themselves. His mission involves several crucial roles: reciting Allah's verses (the Qur'an), purifying them (from wrong beliefs and conduct), teaching them the Scripture and wisdom, and instructing them in knowledge they did not previously possess. This highlights the transformative impact of Prophet Muhammad's mission on the early Muslim community, elevating them from ignorance and misguided practices to a state of knowledge, purity, and wisdom, preparing them for the important role they are meant to play. This blessing is presented as being comparable in significance to the establishment of their unique Qibla.","arabic":"كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولًا مِنْكُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمْ مَا لَمْ تَكُونُوا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"152","text":"Then do ye remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and reject not Faith.","commentary":"Following the discussion of Allah's favours, such as sending a Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) and guiding the believers, this verse calls upon believers to remember Allah and express gratitude. It offers a profound promise: if you remember Allah, Allah will remember you in return.\n\nThis act of remembrance can take many forms, from private reflection to public worship. The commentary highlights sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, where Allah is quoted as saying that if a person remembers Him privately, Allah remembers them. If they remember Him in a gathering, Allah remembers them in a better gathering (like that of angels). Drawing near to Allah is met with Allah drawing even nearer to the person.\n\nThe commentary explains that this divine remembrance is an immense honour and a sign of limitless generosity. It should lead believers to recognize Allah's power above all else. Expressing gratitude to Allah involves acknowledging His blessings, avoiding disobedience, and ultimately dedicating one's life and efforts to serving Him.\n\nThe verse also contains a warning: neglecting remembrance, showing ingratitude, or rebelling against Allah can ultimately lead to rejecting faith altogether. This instruction is presented within the broader context of the challenges the early Muslim community faced, such as the opposition regarding the change of the prayer direction (qiblah). Remembering Allah and being grateful helps believers stay firm in their faith and identity despite external pressures and attempts to mislead them. It reminds them that their strength and guidance come from adhering to Islam and their relationship with Allah.","arabic":"فَاذْكُرُونِي أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لِي وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ"},{"verse":"153","text":"O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.","commentary":"This verse speaks directly to believers, encouraging them to seek strength and support through two important means: patience and prayer. We are reminded that patience and prayer are essential tools, especially when facing the challenges and difficulties inherent in life and in striving to live according to divine guidance. These two qualities are highlighted as primary ways to find help, because Allah is with those who are patient. This is a source of great reassurance, indicating divine support for those who endure patiently. This verse follows broader instructions about the Muslim community's identity and role, providing practical guidance on how to uphold that role through personal discipline and connection with Allah.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ"},{"verse":"154","text":"And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: \"They are dead.\" Nay, they are living, though ye perceive (it) not.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific, difficult aspect of striving for Allah's cause: the sacrifice of lives. It instructs us not to consider those who are killed while striving in Allah's way as merely \"dead.\" It states clearly that they are, in fact, alive, even if this life is not something we can perceive in our ordinary understanding. This challenges the conventional view of death and emphasizes a deeper reality related to sacrifice for a higher purpose. It connects to the previous verse about patience and prayer by acknowledging that the path requires significant sacrifice, and it offers a profound perspective on the status of those who make the ultimate sacrifice, highlighting their continued existence in a way beyond our immediate perception.","arabic":"وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَنْ يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ ۚ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"155","text":"Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere,","commentary":"Building on the themes of patience (from Verse 153) and the potential loss of life (from Verse 154), this verse explicitly states that believers will inevitably face trials. These tests may include experiencing fear, hunger, and the loss of possessions, loved ones, or the results of one's efforts. These trials are presented not as punishment, but as part of the process of spiritual growth and establishing one's commitment. Despite these hardships, the verse offers good news specifically to those who are patient during these trials, setting the stage for the description of their admirable response in the next verse.","arabic":"وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنْفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ"},{"verse":"156","text":"Who say, when afflicted with calamity: \"To Allah We belong, and to Him is our return\":-","commentary":"This verse describes the response of those who are patient in the face of the calamities mentioned in the previous verse. When afflicted, their statement reflects a core understanding of their relationship with Allah: acknowledging that they belong to Allah and that their ultimate return is to Him. This declaration is an expression of complete submission, recognition of Allah's sovereignty over all things, and acceptance of divine decree. It is this profound mindset, born of patience and reliance on Allah, that distinguishes those to whom glad tidings are promised in Verse 155.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"157","text":"They are those on whom (Descend) blessings from Allah, and Mercy, and they are the ones that receive guidance.","commentary":"Concluding this passage, this verse describes the remarkable reward and status for those who demonstrate patience during trials and affirm their belonging and return to Allah, as mentioned in Verses 155 and 156. Such individuals receive blessings and mercy directly from Allah. Furthermore, they are described as the ones who are rightly guided. This verse highlights the immense value of patience and unwavering faith in the face of adversity, showing that these qualities earn divine favor, compassion, and clear guidance, serving as a powerful motivation to endure hardship for Allah's sake. This is presented as a profound return for the patience and sacrifices described in the preceding verses.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"158","text":"Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, it is no sin in them. And if any one obeyeth his own impulse to good,- be sure that Allah is He Who recogniseth and knoweth.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific ritual during the pilgrimage to the Ka'bah in Mecca. Safa and Marwa are two small hills near the Ka'bah, and walking between them is part of the pilgrimage rites. Before Islam, some people had placed idols on these hills, leading some early Muslims to feel hesitant about performing this walk, fearing it might be associated with those older practices. This verse clarifies that Safa and Marwa are in fact symbols established by Allah, not by pagan tradition. Therefore, walking between them during the pilgrimage (`Hajj` or `Umrah`) is a valid and acceptable act of worship. The verse reassures believers that performing this act, and indeed any voluntary good deed, is recognized and appreciated by Allah, Who is fully aware of our intentions and actions. It shows how Islam purified existing practices, restoring their original purpose as acts devoted purely to Allah.","arabic":"إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِنْ شَعَائِرِ اللَّهِ ۖ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا ۚ وَمَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"159","text":"Those who conceal the clear (Signs) We have sent down, and the Guidance, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book,-on them shall be Allah's curse, and the curse of those entitled to curse,-","commentary":"Following the discussion on religious rituals, this verse speaks strongly against those who deliberately hide or suppress the clear truths and guidance that Allah has revealed in His scriptures, even after these truths have been plainly explained for everyone. This is a serious offense in the sight of Allah, and the verse states that such people incur the disapproval and condemnation of Allah and all those who are entitled to condemn such acts. This highlights the importance Islam places on upholding and conveying religious truth without distortion or concealment.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَا أَنْزَلْنَا مِنَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالْهُدَىٰ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّاهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِي الْكِتَابِ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ يَلْعَنُهُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ اللَّاعِنُونَ"},{"verse":"160","text":"Except those who repent and make amends and openly declare (the Truth): To them I turn; for I am Oft-returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse offers an important exception to the severe warning in the previous verse. It makes it clear that the door to repentance is always open for those who have concealed the truth. If they genuinely regret their actions, correct their behavior, and publicly declare the truth they had previously hidden, then Allah will accept their turning back to Him. Allah is described as being ever-ready to accept repentance and being Most Merciful, emphasizing His boundless grace and willingness to forgive those who sincerely seek His forgiveness and strive to do good.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا وَأَصْلَحُوا وَبَيَّنُوا فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَأَنَا التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"161","text":"Those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- on them is Allah's curse, and the curse of angels, and of all mankind;","commentary":"Building on the previous warnings, this verse focuses on those who not only conceal the truth but actively reject faith entirely and persist in this rejection until their death. It states that such individuals will incur the strong disapproval of Allah, the angels, and indeed all upright people. This underscores the gravity of rejecting faith and guidance when it has been made clear, particularly after having known or seen evidence of its truth.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"162","text":"They will abide therein: Their penalty will not be lightened, nor will respite be their (lot).","commentary":"This verse describes the consequence for those mentioned in the previous verse – those who reject faith and die in that state. It states that they will remain in a state of severe punishment, and their suffering will not be eased, nor will they be granted any temporary relief. This serves as a stark warning about the eternal consequences of choosing to deny faith and disregard divine guidance.","arabic":"خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ لَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْظَرُونَ"},{"verse":"163","text":"And your Allah is One Allah: There is no god but He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Transitioning from the warnings about rejecting truth and faith, this verse powerfully reaffirms the central concept of Islam: the absolute oneness of Allah. It declares that the deity you should worship is one and unique; there is no other being worthy of worship but Him. He is further described by two key attributes: Most Gracious and Most Merciful. This emphasizes that despite the warnings issued, Allah's fundamental nature is one of immense grace and overwhelming mercy towards His creation. This establishes the foundation for understanding the universe and life itself.","arabic":"وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"164","text":"Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind; in the rain which Allah Sends down from the skies, and the life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- (Here) indeed are Signs for a people that are wise.","commentary":"Following the declaration of Allah's oneness, this verse invites reflection on the natural world as clear evidence of His existence, power, and wisdom. It points to various phenomena: the vastness and intricate design of the heavens and earth, the regular transition between night and day, the ability of ships to navigate the seas for human benefit, the rain that revives dry land and supports diverse life, the multitude of animals spread across the earth, and the movement of winds and clouds. The verse highlights that in all these aspects of creation, there are indeed profound signs and lessons for those who use their intellect and reflect deeply. It suggests that contemplating the wonders of the universe leads to recognizing the one Creator and Sustainer.","arabic":"إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنْفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِنْ مَاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"165","text":"Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides Allah, as equal (with Allah): They love them as they should love Allah. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for Allah. If only the unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to Allah belongs all power, and Allah will strongly enforce the penalty.","commentary":"In contrast to those who reflect on creation and recognize Allah's oneness, this verse points out that some people still choose to worship others alongside Allah, treating them as if they had equal status or importance. They may even show them the kind of devotion and love that is due only to Allah. This is contrasted sharply with believers, whose love for Allah is paramount and surpasses all other loves. The verse warns the wrongdoers that if they could only foresee the consequences of their actions on the Day of Judgment, they would realize that all power belongs solely to Allah and that He is severe in retribution. This sets the stage for the verses that follow, which depict a scene from that Day.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَتَّخِذُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَنْدَادًا يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ اللَّهِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِلَّهِ ۗ وَلَوْ يَرَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا إِذْ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ أَنَّ الْقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعَذَابِ"},{"verse":"166","text":"Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow (them): They would see the penalty, and all relations between them would be cut off.","commentary":"Continuing the scene from the Day of Judgment mentioned in the previous verse, this verse describes what happens to those who worshipped others alongside Allah. On that Day, those who were followed or worshipped (like idols, false leaders, or worldly desires) will disassociate themselves from their followers. Both the followers and those they followed will witness the punishment awaiting them, and any connections, alliances, or relationships they had built based on their misguided worship will be severed and become meaningless. This emphasizes the futility of false allegiances in the face of Allah's ultimate justice.","arabic":"إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُوا مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوا وَرَأَوُا الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الْأَسْبَابُ"},{"verse":"167","text":"And those who followed would say: \"If only We had one more chance, We would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us.\" Thus will Allah show them (The fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but) regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire.","commentary":"Concluding this scene of the Day of Judgment, this verse captures the bitter regret of those who followed false gods or leaders. Seeing their former objects of worship disown them, they will desperately wish for another chance in earthly life so they could renounce those they had followed. The verse states that Allah will show them the consequences of their earthly actions in a way that fills them with intense regret. It ends by confirming that they will have no escape from the severe punishment (referred to as \"the Fire\"). This serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of making the right choices and establishing the correct relationship with Allah in this life, before it is too late.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوا لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُوا مِنَّا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ اللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ حَسَرَاتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ وَمَا هُمْ بِخَارِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"168","text":"O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, Lawful and good; and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one, for he is to you an avowed enemy.","commentary":"This verse addresses all of humanity, offering a broad permission to partake in the good and lawful things available on Earth. It highlights that Allah has created these resources for our benefit. Following this permission, it warns against following the suggestions of Satan (referred to as \"the evil one\"). The verse emphasizes that Satan is a clear enemy to humanity, whose influence should be avoided. This introduces the idea that while many things are permitted, guidance is needed to discern what is truly beneficial and lawful, and this guidance comes from Allah, not from the enemy of humanity.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ كُلُوا مِمَّا فِي الْأَرْضِ حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"169","text":"For he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, this highlights the nature of Satan's influence. It explains that Satan prompts people towards actions that are wrong and indecent. Crucially, it also warns that Satan encourages people to speak about Allah without proper knowledge or authority. This includes making declarations about what is permissible or forbidden without divine guidance, linking the issue of lawful food (mentioned in 168) to the source of religious authority. Following Satan means stepping away from truth and proper knowledge regarding Allah's commands.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِالسُّوءِ وَالْفَحْشَاءِ وَأَنْ تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"170","text":"When it is said to them: \"Follow what Allah hath revealed:\" They say: \"Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers.\" What! even though their fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance?","commentary":"This verse presents a common human response when confronted with divine revelation: a resistance to change and a preference for tradition over guidance. It describes people who, when asked to follow what Allah has revealed (which includes guidance on what is lawful and right), choose instead to stick to the practices and beliefs they inherited from their ancestors. The verse then critically questions this attitude, asking if they would still follow their forefathers' ways even if those ways lacked wisdom and true guidance. This highlights the importance of using one's reason and seeking true guidance from Allah, rather than blindly adhering to inherited customs, especially in matters of faith and law. This connects directly to the previous verses by showing how Satan's influence can lead to rejecting revealed truth in favor of misguided traditions.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اتَّبِعُوا مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُوا بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَا أَلْفَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا ۗ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"171","text":"The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like a goat-herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom.","commentary":"This verse uses a powerful comparison to describe the state of those who reject faith and guidance, particularly those who cling blindly to inherited ways as mentioned in the previous verse. It likens them to animals (specifically sheep or goats) who hear only the sounds and shouts of a shepherd but do not understand the meaning or instruction behind the calls. The verse then describes them as \"deaf, dumb, and blind,\" not necessarily physically, but in terms of their inability or unwillingness to truly listen to, understand, or see the truth of divine guidance. It concludes that because of this state, they lack true wisdom or understanding of spiritual matters, emphasizing the futility of trying to guide those who willfully close themselves off from truth.","arabic":"وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلَّا دُعَاءً وَنِدَاءً ۚ صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"172","text":"O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah, if it is Him ye worship.","commentary":"Shifting focus from a general address to humanity (as in verse 168) and the state of disbelievers (171), this verse speaks specifically to those who have accepted faith. It repeats the permission to eat the \"good things\" that Allah has provided. However, it adds an essential condition for believers: they must be grateful to Allah. This links the enjoyment of lawful provisions directly to the act of worship. It implies that recognizing Allah as the provider and expressing gratitude for His provisions is a fundamental aspect of truly worshipping Him alone. This verse prepares the way for the specific regulations about forbidden foods that follow.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لِلَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ"},{"verse":"173","text":"He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the general permission to eat lawful things and the instruction to be grateful (verse 172), this verse provides specific details about what is forbidden for believers. It lists four main categories: dead meat (carrion), blood, the flesh of swine (pigs), and meat from animals on which a name other than Allah's was invoked at the time of slaughter. These are stated as the *only* prohibitions, implying that everything else is permissible. The verse also includes an important exception: if someone is facing necessity and has no other choice, consuming something from this list is permissible, provided it is not done out of willful disobedience or exceeding the needed amount. This highlights Allah's mercy and forgiveness, showing that the law considers difficult circumstances. The prohibition of meat sacrificed to others reinforces the central theme of worshipping Allah alone, even in the act of eating.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةَ وَالدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَا أُهِلَّ بِهِ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ ۖ فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلَا عَادٍ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"174","text":"Those who conceal Allah's revelations in the Book, and purchase for them a miserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire; Allah will not address them on the Day of Resurrection. Nor purify them: Grievous will be their penalty.","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus again, moving from dietary laws to a strong condemnation of those who hide or distort the truth revealed by Allah in the divine scriptures. This commentary suggests this specifically refers to people of earlier scriptures who concealed parts that pointed to the truth of Islam or specific religious laws. It describes them as trading Allah's revelations for a small worldly gain. The consequence described for such actions is severe: they are metaphorically said to \"swallow fire\" into their bellies. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not speak to them and will not cleanse them (of their sins or their state), indicating their complete rejection and severe punishment. This highlights the gravity of tampering with divine truth and the severe consequences for those who do so for material benefit.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلَّا النَّارَ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"175","text":"They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in place of Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness (They show) for the Fire!","commentary":"Continuing the theme of the previous verse, this emphasizes the terrible choice made by those who conceal or distort Allah's revelations. It describes their action as a transaction where they deliberately exchange the clear guidance offered by Allah for misguidance and error. Furthermore, they trade the potential for Allah's forgiveness for a state that leads to suffering and torment. The verse concludes with an exclamation about their apparent \"boldness\" or daring in acting in a way that leads them directly towards the Fire (hell). This underscores the self-inflicted nature of their plight and the immense loss they incur by rejecting guidance.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ وَالْعَذَابَ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ"},{"verse":"176","text":"(Their doom is) because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far (from the purpose).","commentary":"This verse explains the reason for the severe outcome described in the previous verses. It states that the punishment awaits those who reject guidance and distort truth because Allah sent down His Book (the scripture, referring here particularly to the Qur'an, but also earlier scriptures) with truth and without doubt. However, instead of accepting this truth, some people actively look for ways to dispute or create disagreements within the Book. The commentary explains that this behavior leads them into a state of deep division, not only among themselves but also a significant departure from the true purpose and meaning of the revelation. This highlights that rejecting or disputing the clear truth of Allah's revealed word leads to being fundamentally misguided and distant from the intended path.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ نَزَّلَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ ۗ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِي الْكِتَابِ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ"},{"verse":"177","text":"It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing.","commentary":"This concluding verse provides a comprehensive definition of true righteousness, offering a stark contrast to the focus on outward rituals or blind adherence to tradition discussed earlier in the passage (like turning one's face in prayer, a point of contention discussed elsewhere in the Sura). It states clearly that righteousness is not merely about physical acts like facing a certain direction during prayer. Instead, it is grounded in core beliefs: faith in Allah, the Last Day (day of judgment), the angels, all the divine Books, and all of Allah's Messengers.\n\nFollowing these beliefs, true righteousness manifests in significant actions: spending one's wealth (even though it is cherished) to help relatives, orphans, the poor, stranded travelers, those who ask for help, and for freeing captives. It also includes consistently performing prayer and giving *zakat* (a form of mandatory charity or tax), fulfilling promises and contracts, and demonstrating firmness and patience during difficult times, suffering, and fear. The verse concludes by identifying those who embody these beliefs and actions as the \"people of truth\" and those who are truly conscious of Allah and fear displeasing Him. This verse summarizes the essence of faith and good conduct as a unified path to righteousness, combining inner conviction with outward action for the benefit of oneself and society.","arabic":"لَيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَنْ تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى الْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ وَالسَّائِلِينَ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَى الزَّكَاةَ وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُوا ۖ وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِي الْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"178","text":"O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who have embraced the faith, reminding them that they receive their laws from Allah. It introduces rules regarding just retribution, known as *qisas*, in cases of unlawful killing. It establishes a principle of equality in retribution: a free person for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a woman for a woman. However, Allah, out of His mercy and grace, also provides an alternative. If the family of the victim (referred to here affectionately as \"the brother of the slain\") chooses to forgive the killer and accept financial compensation instead of demanding retribution, this option is permissible. If this remission is accepted, the victim's family should pursue the compensation fairly and reasonably, while the killer's side must make the payment readily and honorably. This alternative is a sign of Allah's concession and mercy, aiming to prevent further loss of life and reconcile the parties. The verse warns that anyone who acts unjustly or aggressively after such a settlement has been agreed upon will face a severe penalty. This rule connects to the broader theme of establishing a just and ordered society, which is a key objective alongside personal piety.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنْثَىٰ بِالْأُنْثَىٰ ۚ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"179","text":"In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, o ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves.","commentary":"Following the previous verse which outlines the law of just retribution (qisas), this verse explains the profound wisdom behind it. It teaches that this law, seemingly about taking a life, actually serves to preserve life for the community as a whole. It achieves this by acting as a strong deterrent against murder; when someone knows the penalty for taking a life is the loss of their own, they are more likely to refrain. Furthermore, by allowing the victim's family justice or compensation, it prevents cycles of endless revenge and vendettas that could lead to many more deaths, as historically happened in some societies. The verse calls upon people of understanding to reflect on this wisdom. Ultimately, the aim is to encourage self-restraint and God-consciousness (taqwa), which acts as an inner safeguard against committing such crimes in the first place and against seeking excessive revenge. This verse highlights how divine law benefits humanity by promoting both justice and the sanctity of life, reinforcing the connection between social order and individual accountability to Allah.","arabic":"وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"180","text":"It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the Allah-fearing.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of social responsibilities, this verse provides guidance regarding personal wills and inheritance. It states that when a Muslim is nearing death and has property, it is a duty to make a will or bequest (wasiyyah). This will should be in favor of parents and close relatives, to be managed according to fair and reasonable customs. At the time this verse was revealed, specific shares of inheritance had not yet been mandated. Later verses in the Qur'an established fixed shares for parents and other close relatives, making them legal heirs who receive inheritance directly by law. Therefore, this instruction came to apply primarily to relatives who are *not* direct legal heirs under Islamic inheritance law. Making a will for such relatives is seen as a way to strengthen family ties and ensure that those who might otherwise receive nothing are also provided for, reflecting compassion and fairness. This obligation is described as a duty for those who are God-conscious (Allah-fearing), linking proper handling of wealth and family responsibilities to one's relationship with Allah.","arabic":"كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ إِنْ تَرَكَ خَيْرًا الْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"181","text":"If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For Allah hears and knows (All things).","commentary":"This verse addresses the integrity of the will mentioned in the previous verse. It warns that if a person who has knowledge of a will changes its contents after the death of the person who made it, the sin and responsibility for that alteration fall entirely upon the one who makes the change. The deceased person, having fulfilled their duty by making the will, bears no blame for subsequent unauthorized modifications. The verse reinforces this by stating that Allah hears everything and knows everything. This means Allah is aware of the original intentions of the testator, the actions of those who tamper with the will, and all hidden matters. Muslims believe that Allah's attributes, like hearing and knowing all things, are affirmed as they appear in the Qur'an, without likening Allah to His creation or explaining how they occur. Rather, they reflect His majesty and uniqueness in a way beyond human comprehension. This serves as a powerful reminder of accountability to Allah, who is the ultimate witness and judge of people's actions, especially concerning fulfilling trusts and upholding justice regarding the deceased's property.","arabic":"فَمَنْ بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَمَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَا إِثْمُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"182","text":"But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the testator, and makes peace between (The parties concerned), there is no wrong in him: For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"While the previous verse strictly forbids altering a will, this verse provides an important exception based on fairness and reconciliation. It states that if someone responsible for executing a will believes the person who made the will made a mistake or was unfair in distributing property, perhaps showing partiality to some beneficiaries over others, and they intervene to bring about a just settlement or make peace among the concerned parties, then they are not considered sinful for making such changes. This is permissible because the intention is not malicious tampering but rather to correct an potential injustice or prevent conflict among family members, aligning the outcome with the broader principles of fairness and benevolence that Islam encourages. The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful. This highlights that seeking to mend relationships and establish justice, even by adjusting a will to correct a likely oversight or error of the deceased, is an act pleasing to Allah, who overlooks the technical alteration in favor of the greater good achieved through reconciliation. Like the rules of retribution and wills, this is tied back to being God-conscious and acting righteously.","arabic":"فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا أَوْ إِثْمًا فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"183","text":"O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint,-","commentary":"This verse transitions from social and legal matters to a significant religious practice: fasting. It addresses believers directly, highlighting their identity in faith as the basis for accepting this command. It states that fasting has been made obligatory for them, just as it was for communities before them. This indicates that fasting is a universal form of worship with historical roots in monotheistic traditions. The primary purpose given for fasting is to achieve self-restraint or God-consciousness (taqwa). Fasting involves abstaining from food, drink, and other permissible actions during specific hours, which helps individuals gain control over their desires and habits. This discipline strengthens one's will power and increases awareness of Allah, making a person more mindful of His commands and prohibitions in all aspects of life. This connection to taqwa links the practice of fasting back to the overall theme of righteousness and awareness of Allah's presence that runs through this section of the Qur'an.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"184","text":"(Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, this explains some initial details about the obligation of fasting. It clarifies that fasting is required for a specific, limited number of days, not continuously. It then provides exemptions: if a person is ill or on a journey, they are excused from fasting during that time but are required to make up the missed days later when they are well or have returned home. This shows Allah's concern for easing hardship. For those for whom fasting is excessively difficult even when not ill or traveling (such as the elderly or those with chronic illnesses), an alternative is provided: compensating by feeding one needy person for each day of fasting missed. The verse also encourages voluntary good deeds beyond the minimum requirement, stating that feeding more than the minimum is better. Finally, it emphasizes the greater benefit of fasting itself, encouraging believers to understand that fasting is ultimately good for them, hinting at its spiritual, disciplinary, and possibly physical advantages. These details illustrate the flexibility and compassion within the divine command, ensuring that the core purpose of attaining God-consciousness remains accessible.","arabic":"أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۚ فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۚ وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ ۖ فَمَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهُ ۚ وَأَنْ تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"185","text":"Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (Should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.","commentary":"This verse specifies the month during which the obligatory fasting, mentioned in the previous verses, is to be observed: Ramadan. It highlights the significance of Ramadan as the month in which the Qur'an was first revealed. The Qur'an is described as a guidance for all humanity, containing clear proofs of that guidance and the criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong. Because of this profound connection to the divine revelation, Muslims are commanded to fast the entire month if they are present (not ill or traveling). The exemption for the ill and the traveler, requiring them to make up the days later, is reiterated. The verse then beautifully states a core principle of Islamic law: \"Allah intends ease for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties.\" This confirms that religious obligations are meant to be manageable, not excessively burdensome. The purposes of completing the fast are then given: to fulfill the prescribed number of days, to glorify Allah for having guided believers through the Qur'an and Islam, and to express gratitude for this guidance and all of Allah's favors. This verse underscores the spiritual depth of fasting, linking it to the blessing of the Qur'an and the cultivation of gratitude and awareness of Allah.","arabic":"شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِنَ الْهُدَىٰ وَالْفُرْقَانِ ۚ فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَنْ كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۗ يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"186","text":"When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also, with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in the right way.","commentary":"Placed within the verses detailing the rules of fasting, this verse offers immense comfort and reassurance. When Prophet Muhammad's followers ask about Allah, Allah Himself provides the answer directly: \"I am indeed close (to them).\" This emphasizes Allah's immediate accessibility to His servants, without any intermediaries. The verse adds that Allah listens to and answers the prayer (du'a) of everyone who calls upon Him. This signifies Allah's constant attention and responsiveness to the sincere supplications of His servants, especially relevant during times of worship like fasting. In return, Allah calls upon His servants to respond to Him and believe in Him. Responding to Allah means obeying His commands and prohibitions, including those related to fasting and prayer. Believing in Him is the foundation of faith. The verse explains that by responding to Allah and believing in Him, people will be guided to the right way. This intimate dialogue highlights the personal connection available to every believer and encourages them to turn to Allah in prayer, confident in His closeness and readiness to respond, which is particularly empowering during the discipline of fasting.","arabic":"وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ ۖ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا بِي لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ"},{"verse":"187","text":"Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast Till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits (set by) Allah: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint.","commentary":"This verse provides further, practical details about the rules of fasting in Ramadan, specifically concerning the nights. It clarifies that during the nights of the fasting month (between sunset and dawn), it is permissible for married individuals to have sexual intimacy with their spouses. It uses a beautiful metaphor to describe the relationship between spouses: \"They are your garments and you are their garments.\" Just as a garment provides covering, protection, and comfort, spouses provide the same for each other. The verse acknowledges that before this rule was clarified, some Muslims may have struggled with this aspect or acted against stricter initial assumptions, stating that Allah knew what they were doing and, out of His mercy, turned to them and forgave them. Now, it is explicitly allowed to be intimate and to \"seek what Allah has ordained,\" which includes seeking offspring through this relationship. The verse also defines the time for eating and drinking during Ramadan: it is permitted until the true dawn becomes clearly distinguishable from the darkness of the night. The fast then begins at dawn and lasts until nightfall (sunset). A specific prohibition is mentioned for those observing *i'tikaf* (spiritual retreat, usually in a mosque): sexual intimacy with spouses is forbidden during this period of intense devotion. The verse concludes by emphasizing that these are limits set by Allah, and believers should not even approach these limits, but rather maintain a safe distance from anything that might lead to transgression. This serves as a reminder to respect divine boundaries and, like the instruction to fast itself, is given so that people may increase their self-restraint and God-consciousness (taqwa).","arabic":"أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَائِكُمْ ۚ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَهُنَّ ۗ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنْتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ ۖ فَالْآنَ بَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَابْتَغُوا مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۚ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الْأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الْأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَقْرَبُوهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"188","text":"And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.","commentary":"This verse follows the discussion on fasting and maintaining a close relationship with Allah by addressing matters of social conduct and financial honesty. It prohibits Muslims from unjustly consuming each other's wealth or property.\n\nThe verse specifically warns against using wealth to bribe judges or using deceptive tactics in legal proceedings to unjustly take what rightfully belongs to others, even if it seems like a small amount. It emphasizes doing this \"wrongfully and knowingly,\" highlighting the deliberate nature of the injustice.\n\nThis instruction connects directly to the themes of setting boundaries and being mindful of Allah, which were mentioned in the preceding verses about fasting. It shows that righteousness and fearing Allah (*taqwa*) involve not only performing religious rituals but also upholding justice and honesty in dealings with others, particularly regarding property and legal rights. It underscores that accountability is not just to human judges, but ultimately to Allah, who knows everything. As the Prophet Muhammad taught, while a judge might rule based on outward evidence, if someone takes something that is not rightfully theirs, they are accepting a severe consequence from Allah. This illustrates that ethical behavior and social justice are integral parts of a Muslim's faith and relationship with Allah.","arabic":"وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتُدْلُوا بِهَا إِلَى الْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُوا فَرِيقًا مِنْ أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ بِالْإِثْمِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"189","text":"They ask thee concerning the New Moons.

Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah: That ye may prosper.","commentary":"This verse addresses questions about the new moons and their purpose. It explains that the phases of the moon serve as markers for time, helping people determine fixed periods for their activities and for religious duties like the Pilgrimage (Hajj). Following this, the verse dismisses a pre-Islamic custom where people would enter their houses from the rear on certain occasions, particularly after pilgrimage, believing it was a sign of righteousness. The verse clarifies that true righteousness is not about such outward forms or superstitions, but about having consciousness and fear of Allah. It instructs people to enter houses normally, through their proper doors, and reiterates that fearing Allah leads to prosperity. This connects the practical function of the moon phases for Hajj timing with the principle that true piety is inward, centered on awareness of Allah, rather than outward, empty gestures.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ ۗ وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"190","text":"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.","commentary":"Following the discussion of timekeeping and piety, this verse introduces the topic of fighting. It gives permission to fight in the cause of Allah against those who initiate aggression by fighting you. However, it immediately sets a crucial limit, stating that one must not transgress or exceed proper bounds in fighting, because Allah does not love those who do so. The commentary notes that this might have been among the first verses revealed concerning fighting in Islam, establishing the principle of fighting in self-defense against those who initiate hostilities, while emphasizing ethical restrictions.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"191","text":"And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have Turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.","commentary":"Continuing the rules of engagement introduced in the previous verse, this verse permits fighting and driving out those who had persecuted Muslims and driven them from their homes. It highlights that \"tumult and oppression\" (or suppression of faith) are considered worse than killing, justifying the defensive action against those who had committed such acts. However, a specific restriction is mentioned: fighting is not allowed near the Sacred Mosque in Makkah unless the enemy initiates combat there. If attacked at the Sacred Mosque, defensive fighting is permitted. The commentary explains that forcing someone to abandon their faith (oppression) is a severe violation of a fundamental human right and is considered a more serious offense than murder.","arabic":"وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ ۚ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِنْدَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ ۖ فَإِنْ قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"192","text":"But if they cease, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse follows directly from the previous one and offers a condition for the cessation of hostilities. It states that if the enemies cease their aggression and oppression, Allah is greatly forgiving and merciful. The commentary indicates that \"desisting\" here implies not just stopping the fighting, but renouncing their denial of Allah and His message. Accepting Islam would earn them Allah's forgiveness and mercy, absolving them of their previous actions against Muslims. This shows Islam's offer of reconciliation and mercy even to staunch enemies if they choose faith.","arabic":"فَإِنِ انْتَهَوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"193","text":"And fight them on until there is no more Tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.","commentary":"Building on the preceding verses, this verse clarifies the ultimate objective of fighting in Islam: to end \"tumult and oppression\" so that justice and faith in Allah can prevail freely. It emphasizes that fighting must continue until this objective is met. However, if those who were engaged in oppression cease their actions, then hostility should stop, being directed only towards those who continue to practice oppression. The commentary explains that the principle established is to fight any power that prevents people from upholding Islam or knowing about it, ensuring freedom of belief and practice, and protecting the Muslim community from threats.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انْتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"194","text":"The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things prohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.","commentary":"This verse addresses fighting during the sacred months and near the Sacred Mosque, topics mentioned in the overview and implicit in the preceding verses about fighting restrictions. It establishes a principle of reciprocity, particularly regarding the violation of sanctities like the sacred months. If an enemy transgresses by fighting during a prohibited month or in a sacred area, the Muslim community is permitted to respond in kind. However, this permission is balanced with a strong command to fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who exercise self-restraint, emphasizing that retaliation should be measured and within limits.","arabic":"الشَّهْرُ الْحَرَامُ بِالشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْحُرُمَاتُ قِصَاصٌ ۚ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُوا عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"195","text":"And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for Allah loveth those who do good.","commentary":"Following the verses on fighting, this verse urges believers to spend their wealth generously in the cause of Allah. The commentary links this directly to the concept of striving for Allah's cause (Jihad), noting that it requires financial contribution as well as physical effort. It warns that withholding wealth or being miserly can lead to self-destruction for individuals and the community, weakening their ability to support the faith. The verse then elevates the call by encouraging believers to \"do good\" (ihsan), a term indicating the highest level of spiritual excellence where one acts with complete devotion to Allah, knowing that Allah sees all actions.","arabic":"وَأَنْفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ ۛ وَأَحْسِنُوا ۛ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"196","text":"And complete the Hajj or 'umra in the service of Allah.

This is for those whose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah Is strict in punishment.","commentary":"Transitioning from fighting and spending, this verse outlines rules concerning the Pilgrimage (Hajj) and the lesser pilgrimage ('Umrah). It instructs believers to complete these rituals for the sake of Allah once undertaken. If prevented from completing them (e.g., by illness or obstruction), a sacrifice should be offered, and the state of consecration (ihram) may be ended without completing all rites, but heads should not be shaved until the sacrifice has reached its destination. An exception is made for illness or a head ailment requiring shaving during ihram; in this case, compensation is required through fasting, feeding the poor, or offering a sacrifice. For those who combine 'Umrah and Hajj (Tamattu') when safe, a sacrifice is required, but if one cannot afford it, they should fast ten days (three during Hajj, seven upon return). This rule applies to those whose families do not reside near the Sacred Mosque. The verse concludes by emphasizing the importance of fearing Allah and remembering His strictness in punishment, reinforcing the need for proper observance of these detailed rituals.","arabic":"وَأَتِمُّوا الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ ۖ وَلَا تَحْلِقُوا رُءُوسَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ ۚ فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ مَرِيضًا أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِنْ رَأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِنْ صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ ۚ فَإِذَا أَمِنْتُمْ فَمَنْ تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ ۚ فَمَنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ ۗ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"197","text":"For Hajj are the months well known.

So fear Me, o ye that are wise.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion on Hajj from the previous verse, this verse specifies that Hajj takes place during well-known, appointed months. It sets behavioral guidelines for pilgrims during these months, prohibiting lewdness, wicked conduct, and wrangling. It reassures pilgrims that Allah is fully aware of whatever good they do. The verse also advises pilgrims to take physical provisions for their journey but emphasizes that the best provision is right conduct, rooted in fearing Allah. It addresses those with insight, urging them to fear Allah, highlighting the spiritual preparation needed alongside practical arrangements for the pilgrimage journey.","arabic":"الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَعْلُومَاتٌ ۚ فَمَنْ فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ فَلَا رَفَثَ وَلَا فُسُوقَ وَلَا جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ ۗ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ اللَّهُ ۗ وَتَزَوَّدُوا فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَىٰ ۚ وَاتَّقُونِ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"198","text":"It is no crime in you if ye seek of the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage).

This addresses a past hesitation people felt about combining worship with earning a living during Hajj. The verse then describes a ritual: remembering Allah at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the Sacred Monument at Muzdalifah) after departing from 'Arafat, acknowledging Allah's guidance. It reminds believers of their state of error before receiving this guidance through Islam, prompting gratitude. It also includes an instruction to surge forth from where all other pilgrims surge, eliminating class or tribal distinctions that existed in pre-Islamic pilgrimage practices, emphasizing unity and equality among all pilgrims.","arabic":"لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَنْ تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُمْ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِنْدَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ ۖ وَاذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَاكُمْ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الضَّالِّينَ"},{"verse":"199","text":"Then pass on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for the multitude so to do, and ask for Allah's forgiveness.

It emphasizes remembering Allah during this movement, expressing gratitude for the guidance He has provided, especially considering the state of spiritual error people were in before receiving this guidance. It also addresses a pre-Islamic practice where a certain group felt they had special privileges during pilgrimage; this verse removes such distinctions, instructing everyone to move from the same place as everyone else, reinforcing the principle of equality among all pilgrims before Allah. Following this remembrance and movement, the verse encourages pilgrims to pray to Allah for forgiveness, reminding them that Allah is abundantly Forgiving and Merciful. This emphasizes that despite any shortcomings, seeking Allah's pardon is always possible.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَفِيضُوا مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ النَّاسُ وَاسْتَغْفِرُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"200","text":"So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of Allah, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea, with far more Heart and soul.

It instructs Muslims to remember Allah with intense devotion, contrasting this with the pre-Islamic custom of glorifying ancestors after pilgrimage. This is a shift in focus from worldly lineage and past glories to divine remembrance, highlighting the transformation Islam brought. The verse then describes one type of person: those whose focus, even during prayer or seeking from Allah, is solely on receiving benefits in this worldly life. It states that such people, by limiting their focus only to the immediate world, will not have a share in the rewards of the life to come.","arabic":"فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمْ مَنَاسِكَكُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ آبَاءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا ۗ فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ"},{"verse":"201","text":"And there are men who say: \"Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!\"","commentary":"Following the description of those who seek only worldly gain, this verse presents a contrasting type of person. These are individuals whose prayers and aspirations are more balanced and comprehensive. They seek goodness not just in this life, but also in the Hereafter. This prayer acknowledges the importance of wellbeing in the present world while maintaining a strong connection to the eternal life and seeking protection from punishment in the afterlife. This demonstrates a broader vision and deeper understanding of existence and its purpose.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"202","text":"To these will be allotted what they have earned; and Allah is quick in account.","commentary":"This verse speaks about the outcome for those who have the broader perspective mentioned in the previous verse. It assures that these individuals will receive their deserved portion, both in this world and the Hereafter, according to their efforts and sincerity. The mention that Allah is \"quick in account\" serves as a reminder that accountability for actions and intentions is certain and will occur efficiently, urging believers to strive for the comprehensive good in both lives.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا ۚ وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"203","text":"Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days. But if any one hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if any one stays on, there is no blame on him, if his aim is to do right. Then fear Allah, and know that ye will surely be gathered unto Him.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of remembering Allah after the main pilgrimage rites, this verse refers to specific days following the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhu’l-Hijjah), often spent in Mina for rituals like stoning the pillars. It instructs pilgrims to continue remembering Allah during these \"Appointed Days.\" It provides flexibility regarding the duration of stay in Mina; a pilgrim can leave after two days or stay longer, and neither is wrong, provided that their actions are motivated by a conscious desire to do what is right and remain aware of Allah. The verse concludes with a powerful reminder to remain conscious of Allah and to remember that everyone will ultimately be gathered before Him. This serves as an overarching principle for all actions, emphasizing accountability and the return to the Creator.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ فِي أَيَّامٍ مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۚ فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ لِمَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ"},{"verse":"204","text":"There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life May dazzle thee, and he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart; yet is he the most contentious of enemies.","commentary":"This verse introduces a type of person who is very appealing in their speech about worldly matters. They might sound sincere and even invoke Allah to affirm their inner thoughts or intentions. However, the verse reveals that despite their outward charm, they are in reality the most hostile of adversaries. This highlights the importance of looking beyond smooth words to understand a person's true nature and intentions.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ الْخِصَامِ"},{"verse":"205","text":"When he turns his back, His aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. But Allah loveth not mischief.","commentary":"Following on from the description in the previous verse, this verse describes the actions of the deceptive person when they are not directly facing you or are in a position of influence. It explains that their hidden hostility manifests as actively seeking to spread corruption, harm, and destruction in society, impacting even basic life like agriculture and livestock. This is strongly condemned, as Allah does not approve of mischief or corruption.","arabic":"وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ"},{"verse":"206","text":"When it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", He is led by arrogance to (more) crime. Enough for him is Hell;-An evil bed indeed (To lie on)!","commentary":"This verse completes the portrait of the insincere, hostile person by describing their reaction when confronted with guidance or reminded to be mindful of Allah. Instead of accepting advice, their arrogance drives them deeper into sin and wrongdoing. The commentary explains that this pride prevents them from seeking reform or fearing Allah. As a consequence, their ultimate destination is Hell, described here as a terrible resting place, serving as a stern warning about the outcome of persistent arrogance and rejection of truth. This connects back to the previous verses by showing the defiant attitude that stems from their inner corruption and outward deception.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالْإِثْمِ ۚ فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ"},{"verse":"207","text":"And there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of Allah: And Allah is full of kindness to (His) devotees.","commentary":"In sharp contrast to the negative type described in the preceding verses, this verse presents a different kind of person: one who is dedicated to gaining Allah's approval, willing even to sacrifice their life for this purpose. This illustrates the path of sincere faith and devotion. The commentary explains that this type is selfless and entirely focused on seeking Allah's pleasure above all else. It highlights Allah's immense kindness and compassion towards those who are devoted to Him, showing the positive outcome of a life lived in sincerity and submission. This verse serves as a contrasting example to the insincere person.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"208","text":"O ye who believe! Enter into Islam whole-heartedly; and follow not the footsteps of the evil one; for he is to you an avowed enemy.","commentary":"Addressing those who believe, this verse calls for complete and full submission to Allah. It urges believers to embrace the way of Islam entirely, without hesitation or reservation in all aspects of their lives. It then issues a strong warning against following the path of Satan, identifying him as a clear and open enemy. The commentary explains that entering Islam wholeheartedly means surrendering intentions, actions, and destiny to Allah with trust and confidence. It emphasizes that there are only two paths: Allah's guidance or Satan's deviation, and believers must be firm in choosing Allah's path.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"209","text":"If ye backslide after the clear (Signs) have come to you, then know that Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","commentary":"This verse follows the call for complete submission by warning about the consequences of turning away or stumbling after having received clear evidence of the truth. It serves as a reminder that if one deviates after understanding the signs, they should know that Allah possesses immense power and wisdom. The commentary notes that this underscores the seriousness of the warning in the previous verse, implying that challenging Allah's guidance or power through deviation exposes one to severe consequences determined by His authority and wisdom.","arabic":"فَإِنْ زَلَلْتُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْكُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"210","text":"Will they wait until Allah comes to them in canopies of clouds, with angels (in His train) and the question is (thus) settled? but to Allah do all questions go back (for decision).","commentary":"This verse questions the hesitation of those who are reluctant to fully submit, asking if they are waiting for a dramatic, visible appearance of Allah along with angels before they will believe or accept the truth. The commentary interprets this as a rhetorical question challenging their delay until the Day of Judgement arrives, when everything will be decisively settled, and the opportunity to believe and repent will be gone. It emphasizes that ultimately, all matters of decision and judgement belong entirely to Allah, underscoring the certainty and finality of His decree.","arabic":"هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ"},{"verse":"211","text":"Ask the Children of Israel how many clear (Signs) We have sent them. But if any one, after Allah's favour has come to him, substitutes (something else), Allah is strict in punishment.","commentary":"This verse directs attention to the historical experience of the Children of Israel (a previous community who received divine scripture). It mentions that Allah sent them many clear signs, yet some of them altered or disregarded the favors and guidance given to them. The commentary explains that referring to the Children of Israel here serves as a timely lesson and warning to the current community of believers. It cautions them against repeating the mistakes of past nations who received clear guidance but chose to deviate or substitute it with something else. The verse concludes with a reminder that Allah is severe in punishment for those who alter or reject His grace after it has been bestowed upon them.","arabic":"سَلْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ كَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ مِنْ آيَةٍ بَيِّنَةٍ ۗ وَمَنْ يُبَدِّلْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"212","text":"The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the outlook and fate of those who reject faith with those who believe. It describes worldly life as appealing and attractive to disbelievers, which often leads them to mock or look down upon believers. However, the verse asserts that on the Day of Resurrection, those who were righteous and mindful of Allah will hold a higher rank than the disbelievers. The commentary explains that disbelievers are limited to seeing only the material and temporary aspects of this life, whereas believers have a broader perspective focused on higher values and the hereafter. It reassures believers that despite any worldly scorn, their true worth and ultimate reward lie with Allah, who gives generously to whom He chooses, both in this life and the next, in ways beyond human calculation.","arabic":"زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا وَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۘ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ"},{"verse":"213","text":"Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace Guided the believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight.","commentary":"This verse explains the origin and development of humanity's relationship with divine guidance. It states that mankind began as one community. As they grew and diversified, differences and disagreements arose. In His wisdom, Allah sent messengers with messages of hope and warnings, and with them, He sent divine revelation, referred to as \"the Book,\" containing the truth to resolve the disagreements among people. The commentary explains that this \"Book\" serves as the ultimate standard and arbiter. It notes that despite receiving clear guidance, differences persisted among those given the Book (the People of the Book), often stemming from their own jealousy, greed, or selfishness. The verse concludes by stating that Allah, by His grace, guided the believers to the truth regarding the matters they differed upon, reaffirming that Allah guides whoever He wills to the correct path.","arabic":"كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ النَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ وَأَنْزَلَ مَعَهُمُ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِيمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ ۚ وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ فَهَدَى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"214","text":"Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of bliss) without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: \"When (will come) the help of Allah?\" Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near!","commentary":"This verse directly addresses believers, posing a profound question: Do you expect to enter Paradise without facing the kinds of trials and hardships endured by those who believed before you? It describes these past challenges as suffering and adversity so intense that they severely tested the spirit, leading even the Prophet at that time, and the believers with him, to question when Allah's help would arrive. The verse then immediately offers reassurance, declaring that the help of Allah is indeed always near. This highlights that enduring difficult trials and remaining steadfast is a necessary experience to purify and strengthen believers, preparing them for Allah's support and ultimately for the reward of Paradise. It serves as a timeless reminder that the path of faith often involves struggle, and perseverance through these difficulties is key to earning Allah's promise of assistance and ultimate success.","arabic":"أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَنْ تَدْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُمْ مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْا مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ ۖ مَسَّتْهُمُ الْبَأْسَاءُ وَالضَّرَّاءُ وَزُلْزِلُوا حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ نَصْرَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ"},{"verse":"215","text":"They ask thee what they should spend (In charity). Say: Whatever ye spend that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and for wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well.","commentary":"This verse addresses a question from the early Muslims about what they should give in charity. It teaches that whatever good is spent from one's wealth should first be given to parents and close relatives, then to orphans, the needy, and travelers who are in difficulty. The purpose of this guidance is to encourage generosity and support for those within one's immediate circle and the wider community. It emphasizes that giving charity is good for the donor, the recipient, and society as a whole, and encourages giving from the best of one's possessions. The verse concludes by reminding us that Allah is fully aware of all the good deeds we do, assuring us that our charitable acts, and the intentions behind them, are known and will be rewarded. This verse sets the stage for further guidance by addressing specific questions raised by the believers.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ ۖ قُلْ مَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ ۗ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"216","text":"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.","commentary":"Following the discussion on charity, this verse addresses the duty of engaging in defensive fighting, acknowledging that it is difficult and disliked. It teaches a fundamental principle: sometimes, things we dislike may ultimately be good for us, and things we love may be harmful. In the case of fighting for a just cause, while it is challenging, it can be necessary for the protection of the community and upholding what is right. This principle extends beyond fighting to all aspects of life, reminding us that human perception is limited. Allah, who has complete knowledge, knows the true outcome and benefits of actions, while we do not. This encourages trust in Allah's wisdom and guidance, even when His commands seem difficult or unappealing at first glance.","arabic":"كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَكُمْ ۖ وَعَسَىٰ أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۖ وَعَسَىٰ أَنْ تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"217","text":"They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: \"Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members.\" Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.","commentary":"This verse directly answers a question about fighting during the sacred months, a period traditionally held as inviolable. It states clearly that fighting during this time is a serious matter. However, it immediately highlights that other actions are even more serious in the sight of Allah: preventing people from following Allah's path, rejecting faith in Him, obstructing access to the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca), and driving people out of their homes. The verse points out that oppression and persecution are worse than physical fighting or killing. It reveals the ultimate goal of those who oppose the Muslims: to make them abandon their faith. This clarifies that the aggression was initiated by the opponents, not the Muslims, and that the gravity of their actions – religious persecution and obstruction – far outweighs the specific incident of fighting in a sacred month. The verse then sternly warns that anyone who abandons their faith and dies as a disbeliever will lose everything in this life and the hereafter, facing severe consequences. This emphasizes the importance of holding firm to one's faith despite pressure. The subsequent verse offers hope to those who remain steadfast and strive for Allah's cause.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ ۖ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ ۖ وَصَدٌّ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ ۗ وَلَا يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَنْ دِينِكُمْ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعُوا ۚ وَمَنْ يَرْتَدِدْ مِنْكُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُولَٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"218","text":"Those who believed and those who suffered exile and fought (and strove and struggled) in the path of Allah,- they have the hope of the Mercy of Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the warning in the previous verse about the consequences of abandoning faith under duress, this verse offers comfort and hope. It speaks of those who believed, who were forced to leave their homes (exiled), and who struggled and strove for the sake of Allah. These individuals, who faced immense hardship and persecution for their faith, are assured that they have hope of receiving Allah's mercy. It highlights the great value placed on sincere belief, sacrifice, and striving in the face of opposition. By mentioning Allah's attributes as Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, the verse reassures believers that their efforts and struggles are recognized and that Allah is ready to forgive any shortcomings and bestow His abundant mercy upon them. This serves as encouragement for believers to persevere.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا وَجَاهَدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أُولَٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"219","text":"They ask thee concerning wine and gambling.

First, it tackles questions about intoxicants (like wine) and gambling, which were common practices at the time. The response acknowledges that while these may offer some temporary benefits or pleasures, their harm and negative consequences (\"great sin\") are far greater than any perceived profit. This highlights a principle for evaluating matters: weigh the good against the bad, and if the bad predominates, it should be avoided. This was an initial step in a gradual process of discouraging and eventually prohibiting these practices, recognizing they were deeply ingrained social habits.\n\nThe second question in this verse asks about how much to spend in charity, building on the theme from verse 215. The answer is to spend \"what is beyond your needs,\" meaning what is surplus to one's basic, reasonable requirements and those of one's dependents. This encourages generosity beyond the minimum obligation. The verse concludes by stating that Allah makes His signs and guidance clear in this way so that we may reflect upon our lives. This reflection is further elaborated in the next verse.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ ۖ قُلْ فِيهِمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَإِثْمُهُمَا أَكْبَرُ مِنْ نَفْعِهِمَا ۗ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ قُلِ الْعَفْوَ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"220","text":"(Their bearings) on this life and the Hereafter.

And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the reflection mentioned at the end of verse 219, urging us to consider the implications of Allah's guidance on both this life and the life to come. It then addresses a new question concerning the treatment of orphans. It instructs that the guiding principle for those caring for orphans should be to do what is best for their welfare and improvement. If guardians find it easier or more practical to mix the orphans' affairs or property with their own, they are reminded that the orphans are their brothers and sisters in faith, implying a responsibility based on kinship and brotherhood. However, it sternly warns against exploiting or harming the orphans' interests under the guise of mixing affairs. Allah, who has perfect knowledge, can distinguish between those who genuinely intend good for the orphans and those who intend harm or mischief. The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah, in His power and wisdom, could have made matters more difficult for us, but He has provided clear guidance out of His mercy. This serves as a reminder of Allah's grace and the ease He intends for believers, encouraging them to act sincerely according to His guidance, especially concerning the vulnerable.","arabic":"فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۗ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَامَىٰ ۖ قُلْ إِصْلَاحٌ لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ ۖ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ الْمُصْلِحِ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَأَعْنَتَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"221","text":"Do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe: A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you.

But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they may celebrate His praise.","commentary":"This verse addresses the foundational relationship of marriage within the Muslim community. It teaches that Muslims should not marry individuals who associate partners with Allah (often referred to as idolaters), unless those individuals accept the true faith. The reasoning explained is that marriage is a deep and enduring bond, requiring a strong common objective for harmony and unity. The commentary highlights that faith in Allah provides this essential connection. Even a believing bondwoman is considered better than an idolatrous woman, regardless of her attractiveness, because the spiritual connection through shared belief is more profound and lasting than mere physical attraction. Similarly, Muslim women are instructed not to marry men who associate partners with Allah unless they believe. The reason given is that those who do not believe invite towards the Fire (a metaphor for a harmful outcome and destiny), whereas Allah calls people towards His grace, leading to Paradise and forgiveness. Sharing faith ensures that both partners are directed towards the same ultimate goal and path guided by Allah. This verse helps establish the distinct social and spiritual identity of the Muslim community.","arabic":"وَلَا تَنْكِحُوا الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ ۚ وَلَأَمَةٌ مُؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ مُشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ ۗ وَلَا تُنْكِحُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُوا ۚ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ مُشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَالْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ ۖ وَيُبَيِّنُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"222","text":"They ask thee concerning women's courses.

But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by Allah. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.","commentary":"Following the guidelines on who Muslims should marry, this verse addresses matters of physical intimacy within marriage, specifically regarding menstruation. When asked about this, the answer given is that it is an unclean condition. Therefore, men are instructed to keep away from sexual intimacy with their wives during their menstrual periods and not to approach them in that way until they are clean. Once the women have purified themselves (after menstruation), couples may resume physical intimacy in the proper way as ordained by Allah. The commentary explains that sexual relations during menstruation are considered unclean and carry health risks, and furthermore, they do not serve the higher purpose of procreation which is a significant aspect of marital intimacy. By following these guidelines and maintaining purity, Muslims demonstrate obedience to Allah, for He loves those who turn to Him in repentance and those who keep themselves pure. This verse transitions the discussion from the selection of a marriage partner to the purity and conduct within the marital relationship itself.","arabic":"وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْمَحِيضِ ۖ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَاعْتَزِلُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ ۖ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ التَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ"},{"verse":"223","text":"Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear Allah. And know that ye are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give (these) good tidings to those who believe.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion about marital intimacy, building upon the previous verse regarding cleanliness after menstruation. It uses the metaphor of wives being like a \"tilth\" (fertile land) for their husbands. This imagery highlights the aspect of marriage related to fertility and procreation. Within this framework, husbands are told they may approach their wives for intimacy when or how they desire, emphasizing mutual comfort and fulfillment. However, this physical aspect is framed within a larger context of accountability to Allah. The verse instructs believers to first \"provide something for your souls\" (interpreted as doing good deeds) before engaging in this act, to fear Allah, and to remember that they will meet Him. This connects the physical intimacy of marriage to spiritual consciousness and the ultimate accountability in the Hereafter. The verse assures believers that adhering to these guidelines brings good tidings, reinforcing that even intimate aspects of life are guided by Allah for the well-being and spiritual upliftment of individuals and society. It integrates physical relations into the broader framework of worship and consciousness of Allah.","arabic":"نِسَاؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَكُمْ فَأْتُوا حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ ۖ وَقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ مُلَاقُوهُ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"224","text":"And make not Allah's (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth all things.","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to the subject of oaths, particularly oaths made in the name of Allah. It teaches that a person should not use an oath as a justification or barrier to refrain from doing good deeds, acting righteously, or making peace between others. The commentary explains that if someone makes an oath that prevents them from doing something good or beneficial, the better course of action is to break that oath, perform the good deed, and then offer atonement for the oath according to Islamic teachings. The promotion of goodness, righteousness, and reconciliation is given precedence over adhering to such an oath. The verse reminds believers that Allah hears and knows everything, reinforcing the importance of being mindful of one's intentions and actions, especially when invoking His name. This introduces the general principle regarding oaths before discussing specific situations related to marriage in the following verses.","arabic":"وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا اللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لِأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَنْ تَبَرُّوا وَتَتَّقُوا وَتُصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"225","text":"Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.","commentary":"Following the general principle about oaths, this verse provides further detail regarding accountability. It clarifies that Allah does not hold people accountable for oaths made thoughtlessly or casually, perhaps out of habit or in the heat of the moment, where there was no serious intention behind them. However, people are held accountable for oaths that reflect a deliberate intention or commitment in their hearts. This highlights the importance of intention in one's actions. The verse concludes by mentioning Allah's attributes as Oft-Forgiving and Most Forbearing, signifying His mercy and leniency towards His servants, particularly regarding unintentional slips or when providing a way out of detrimental oaths through atonement. This serves as a reminder of Allah's knowledge of inner thoughts and His forgiving nature.","arabic":"لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ اللَّهُ بِاللَّغْوِ فِي أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ يُؤَاخِذُكُمْ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"226","text":"For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting for four months is ordained; if then they return, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific type of oath related to marriage: an oath by a husband to abstain from sexual relations with his wife for a period. This practice was sometimes used as a form of punishment or pressure. Islam does not permit such abstention to last indefinitely or for a very long time. This verse ordains a maximum waiting period of four months for such an oath. The commentary explains that this period is set as a reasonable limit, providing a test period for the relationship. If, within these four months, the husband decides to resume marital relations, he may do so, and Allah is described as Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, indicating that returning to the relationship after such an oath is permissible and can be a positive step. This ruling sets a clear limit on a practice that could otherwise cause significant harm and distress to the wife and the family unit.","arabic":"لِلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِنْ نِسَائِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ ۖ فَإِنْ فَاءُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"227","text":"But if their intention is firm for divorce, Allah heareth and knoweth all things.","commentary":"This verse continues the ruling from the previous one regarding the oath of abstention (*ila'*). It states that if, after the four-month waiting period mentioned in verse 226, the husband has not resumed marital relations and his intention is firm to end the marriage, this constitutes a decision for divorce. In such a case, the marriage is dissolved. The verse concludes by reminding that Allah hears and knows everything, emphasizing the seriousness of this decision and the husband's accountability to Allah. This provides a clear resolution to the situation arising from the oath of abstention, ensuring that the wife is not left in an uncertain state indefinitely and paving the way for the dissolution of the marriage if reconciliation does not occur.","arabic":"وَإِنْ عَزَمُوا الطَّلَاقَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"228","text":"Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","commentary":"This verse introduces the rules governing divorce, starting with the waiting period for divorced women, known as the *`iddah*. It states that a divorced woman must wait for three monthly periods (interpreted as menstrual cycles or periods of cleanliness). The commentary explains that the primary purposes of this waiting period are to determine if she is pregnant by the divorcing husband and to allow time for reflection and potential reconciliation. During this period, it is strictly unlawful for the woman to conceal a pregnancy, if she is indeed pregnant, particularly emphasizing this by reminding her of her faith in Allah and the Last Day. The verse grants the husband the right to take his wife back during this waiting period if he genuinely desires reconciliation, without the need for a new marriage contract. The commentary also states that women have rights against their husbands similar to the rights husbands have over them, according to what is equitable. It notes that men have a \"degree of advantage,\" which the commentary explains is not an absolute superiority but is context-specific, such as the husband's role in initiating divorce or his right to take the wife back during the waiting period. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's attributes as Exalted in Power and Wise, emphasizing that these rules are established with ultimate authority and perfect wisdom.","arabic":"وَالْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَاثَةَ قُرُوءٍ ۚ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَنْ يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِي أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِنْ كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوا إِصْلَاحًا ۚ وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"229","text":"A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others).","commentary":"This verse clarifies the number of times a divorce can be initiated and revoked. It states that a divorce is permissible and can be revoked twice. After these two instances, if a separation occurs again, it should result in either keeping the wife and living together equitably or separating permanently with kindness. The commentary explains that this rule prevents the abuse of divorce by repeatedly divorcing and taking back a wife without a genuine intention to continue the marriage harmoniously. The verse also addresses the matter of dowry (gifts given by the husband to the wife). It is generally not lawful for the husband to take back any part of the dowry after divorce. An exception is made in a situation where both the husband and wife fear they cannot maintain the marriage according to Allah's limits; in such a case, if the wife seeks divorce and gives something back to the husband for her freedom (known as *khul'*), there is no blame on either party. This allows a way for a wife to end an unbearable marriage. The verse concludes by emphasizing that these are the limits set by Allah, and transgressing them is an act of wrongdoing against oneself and others, reinforcing the divine authority and importance of these regulations for a just and stable society.","arabic":"الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَنْ يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"230","text":"So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand.","commentary":"This verse details the consequence of the third divorce. It states that if a husband divorces his wife for the third time, this divorce is final and irrevocable. He cannot remarry her immediately. The verse lays down a condition for them to be able to remarry: the wife must first marry another man, and that second marriage must naturally come to an end (either through death or divorce by the second husband). Only after this second marriage has ended, and the wife has completed her waiting period from the second husband, can the first husband remarry her. This is permissible only if both the original husband and wife believe that they can now live together and uphold the limits set by Allah. The commentary explains that this stern rule is intended to make men reflect deeply before resorting to divorce, particularly for the second and third time, highlighting the gravity of dissolving the marriage bond and preventing its abuse. It emphasizes that these are limits ordained by Allah and made clear for those who reflect and understand, underscoring the wisdom and clarity of divine law. This verse concludes the core sequence of rulings regarding divorce frequency and its consequences.","arabic":"فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِنْ بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ ۗ فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَنْ يَتَرَاجَعَا إِنْ ظَنَّا أَنْ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"231","text":"When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue advantage; if any one does that; He wrongs his own soul.

And fear Allah, and know that Allah is well acquainted with all things.","commentary":"This verse addresses the conclusion of the waiting period (called 'Iddat') after a divorce. It instructs husbands that as this period ends, they must make a clear choice: either take their wife back into the marriage honorably and fairly, or release her from the marriage bond completely and amicably. It strictly forbids taking her back with the intention of harming her or gaining an unfair advantage. Doing so, the verse emphasizes, is an injustice against one's own self because it goes against the guidance of Allah. The verse then issues a strong warning against treating Allah's commands lightly. It reminds believers to appreciate the blessings Allah has given them, especially the revelation of the Qur'an (the Book) and the wisdom it contains, which serves as guidance. The verse concludes by urging individuals to be mindful of Allah and to know that Allah is fully aware of everything they do, reinforcing the importance of acting with integrity and fairness in these matters. This connects directly to the previous verses which discussed the process and implications of divorce, highlighting the need for the final step to be conducted justly.","arabic":"وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ سَرِّحُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ ۚ وَلَا تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لِتَعْتَدُوا ۚ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ ۚ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا آيَاتِ اللَّهِ هُزُوًا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَا أَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"232","text":"When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms.

If a woman is divorced and her waiting period has ended, and she and her former husband mutually agree to remarry on honorable terms, her guardians should not prevent this. This instruction is specifically for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, emphasizing that such adherence is a sign of faith. The verse states that allowing such remarriage when mutually desired is the most virtuous and pure course of action. It concludes by stating that Allah knows what is best, while people's understanding may be limited, underscoring the wisdom behind this command.","arabic":"وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنْكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ إِذَا تَرَاضَوْا بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۗ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"233","text":"The mothers shall give such to their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete the term.

But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what ye do.","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to the important matter of child care after divorce, particularly breastfeeding. It states that mothers should breastfeed their children for a full two years if the father wishes for the full duration of suckling. The father is responsible for providing for the mother's food and clothing during this time in a fair manner. The principle is laid down that no person should be burdened beyond their capacity, and neither parent should be made to suffer unfairly because of the child. If the father passes away, his heir takes on the responsibility of providing for the mother for the child's sake. The verse also allows for mutual decisions; if the parents, after consultation, agree to wean the child before two years, there is no blame upon them. Similarly, if they decide to use a wet nurse (foster-mother), it is permissible, provided the agreed payment is given fairly. This guidance highlights the well-being of the child as paramount. It concludes with a reminder to be mindful of Allah, who sees all actions, reinforcing the importance of fulfilling these responsibilities with fairness and integrity.","arabic":"وَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ ۖ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ ۚ وَعَلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَا تُضَارَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَهُ بِوَلَدِهِ ۚ وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَٰلِكَ ۗ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا ۗ وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمْ أَنْ تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُمْ مَا آتَيْتُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"234","text":"If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner.

They are to wait for four months and ten days. This waiting period serves multiple purposes, including ascertaining whether the widow is pregnant and providing a period of mourning and adjustment. Once this specific period is over, the verse states that there is no blame upon the guardians or community if the widow then makes decisions about her life, such as remarrying, in a just and appropriate manner according to Islamic teachings. This instruction helped abolish harsh pre-Islamic customs regarding widows. The verse ends by reminding everyone that Allah is fully aware of all actions, emphasizing accountability.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنْكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا ۖ فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنْفُسِهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"235","text":"There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts.

It states that there is no blame on someone if they indicate a potential interest in marrying a widow after her waiting period (mentioned in the previous verse) has ended, or even if they simply hold such an intention in their heart during her waiting period. Allah is aware of these inner thoughts and feelings. However, the verse strictly prohibits making a binding marriage contract in secret during the waiting period, or finalizing the marriage tie before the waiting period is completed. Any communication should be conducted respectfully and honorably. It reinforces the importance of being mindful of Allah, who knows what is in people's hearts, and reminds believers that Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most Forbearing, encouraging adherence to these guidelines while acknowledging human nature.","arabic":"وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ النِّسَاءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنْتُمْ فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرًّا إِلَّا أَنْ تَقُولُوا قَوْلًا مَعْرُوفًا ۚ وَلَا تَعْزِمُوا عُقْدَةَ النِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ الْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"236","text":"There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (A suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means;- A gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific scenario in divorce: when a marriage is ended before the couple has physically come together, and either before a dowry (Mahr) was formally agreed upon, or if it was agreed but not yet finalized. In this situation, the husband is instructed that while there is no blame on him for the divorce itself, he should still provide a parting gift to the woman. The amount of this gift should be based on his financial ability – the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means. Giving this gift is described as a duty upon those who strive to do what is right, emphasizing kindness and fairness even when the marriage did not fully materialize. This guidance transitions from the broader rules of divorce and remarriage to specific financial considerations in certain cases.","arabic":"لَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُوا لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً ۚ وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعًا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"237","text":"And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness.

For Allah sees well all that ye do.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse about divorce before consummation, this verse addresses the situation where a dowry (Mahr) *was* agreed upon before the divorce took place, even if the marriage was not consummated. In this case, the woman is entitled to half of the agreed-upon dowry. However, this amount can be altered if the woman chooses to forgo her half, or if the husband, who is holding the marriage tie (meaning he initiated the divorce), chooses to give her the full amount. The verse adds that forgoing one's right to the half dowry is considered closer to righteousness, encouraging generosity and kindness. It concludes by urging both parties not to forget to be gracious and benevolent towards each other and reminding them that Allah sees all that they do, promoting ethical conduct even in separation.","arabic":"وَإِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلَّا أَنْ يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ النِّكَاحِ ۚ وَأَنْ تَعْفُوا أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ ۚ وَلَا تَنْسَوُا الْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"238","text":"Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; and stand before Allah in a devout (frame of mind).","commentary":"This verse shifts focus from family matters to the fundamental act of worship in Islam: prayer. It commands believers to be diligent and consistent in observing their prayers, singling out the \"Middle Prayer\" for special emphasis (which Muslims understand refers to the 'Asr or mid-afternoon prayer, a time when people might be easily distracted). It instructs believers to stand before Allah in prayer with a state of devout obedience and humility. This interjection of prayer within verses about family law highlights that all aspects of a Muslim's life, including personal and social relations, are connected to the worship and remembrance of Allah, showing that adherence to these divine laws is itself an act of devotion.","arabic":"حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ"},{"verse":"239","text":"If ye fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most convenient), but when ye are in security, celebrate Allah's praises in the manner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before).","commentary":"Continuing the theme of prayer from the previous verse, this verse provides guidance on how to perform prayers during times of fear or danger, such as facing an enemy. It allows for flexibility, permitting prayer to be performed while walking or riding, in whatever posture is most convenient and safe under the circumstances, even if it means deviating from the normal procedure. However, it contrasts this with times of security, when believers are instructed to return to celebrating Allah's praises and performing prayer in the prescribed, complete manner that Allah has taught them. This emphasizes the importance of prayer and remembrance of Allah under all conditions, from safety to danger, acknowledging human limitations in difficult situations but restoring the full practice when conditions allow.","arabic":"فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالًا أَوْ رُكْبَانًا ۖ فَإِذَا أَمِنْتُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُمْ مَا لَمْ تَكُونُوا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"240","text":"Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year's maintenance and residence; but if they leave (The residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","commentary":"Returning to the topic of widows, this verse instructs men who are nearing death and leaving behind wives to make a will (bequeath) ensuring their widows receive provision and residence for one year. This was a right granted to widows. This provision for a year's maintenance and residence allowed the widow to stay in her husband's home. However, the verse also states that if the widow chooses to leave the residence after her waiting period (mentioned in verse 234) has concluded, there is no blame on her guardians or the community for what she does with herself in a lawful and appropriate manner. The use of the plural \"you\" indicates a communal responsibility to respect the widow's decision after her waiting period. The verse concludes by affirming that Allah is Exalted in Power and Wise, emphasizing that these laws are established with ultimate authority and profound wisdom, reflecting Allah's care for the welfare of people.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنْكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لِأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ ۚ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنْفُسِهِنَّ مِنْ مَعْرُوفٍ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"241","text":"For divorced women Maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale). This is a duty on the righteous.","commentary":"This verse follows the detailed rulings on divorce. It emphasizes the right of divorced women to receive fair support or provisions from their former husbands. This isn't just about financial maintenance; it's intended to help ease the difficulties and emotional impact of separation. Providing this support justly is considered a duty, especially for those who strive to live righteously and are mindful of Allah. The commentary suggests that this provision aims to lessen the bitterness and sadness that can come with divorce, highlighting Islam's emphasis on kindness and fairness even when a marriage has ended.","arabic":"وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"242","text":"Thus doth Allah Make clear His Signs to you: In order that ye may understand.","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding statement for the preceding set of rulings, including those on marriage, divorce, and related matters. It highlights that Allah makes His guidelines clear and understandable for humanity. The purpose behind making these rules clear is so that people can grasp their meaning and significance. It reminds us that Allah presents His laws clearly, fairly, and effectively, inviting us to reflect on their value and recognize His guidance and mercy in them. These teachings are meant to bring harmony and understanding to our relationships and society, emphasizing that following Allah's commands is beneficial for our lives, both individually and collectively.","arabic":"كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"243","text":"Didst thou not Turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (In number), for fear of death? Allah said to them: \"Die\": Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but Most of them are ungrateful.","commentary":"This verse asks us to reflect on a historical example: a large group of people who left their homes in great numbers because they feared death. It tells us that despite their attempt to escape, Allah caused them to die, and then He brought them back to life. This highlights that life and death are entirely in the hands of Allah. Their efforts to flee could not prevent what Allah had decreed for them. Allah's power over life and death is absolute. The verse concludes by noting that Allah bestows great favor and bounty upon humanity, yet many people are ungrateful for these blessings, including the gift of life itself.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ اللَّهُ مُوتُوا ثُمَّ أَحْيَاهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"244","text":"Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.","commentary":"Following the previous verse which showed Allah's absolute control over life and death, this verse directly addresses believers, encouraging them to strive and fight for the cause of Allah. It implies that since life and death are in Allah's hands anyway, the fear of death should not hold back someone who is committed to Allah's path. When striving for Allah's cause, believers are reminded that Allah hears their prayers and their intentions, and He knows all things, including their actions and their sincerity.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"245","text":"Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that giveth (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return.","commentary":"Building on the call to strive in the previous verse, which often involves sacrifice, this verse speaks about financial contribution for Allah's cause. It poses a rhetorical question, asking who will give a \"beautiful loan\" to Allah. This refers to spending wealth in charity and for Allah's sake. The verse assures believers that Allah will repay this loan by multiplying the reward many times over, both in this life and the Hereafter. It also emphasizes that wealth, whether scarcity or abundance, comes from Allah, and ultimately, everyone and all their possessions will return to Him. This reinforces the idea that wealth, like life, is a trust from Allah, to be used in ways that please Him.","arabic":"مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"246","text":"Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (That was) among them: \"Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of Allah.\" He said: \"Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that that ye will not fight?\" They said: \"How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?\" but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those who do wrong.","commentary":"This verse shifts to recount a story from the history of the Children of Israel after the time of Prophet Moses. It tells of a time when their elders asked a prophet among them to appoint a king to lead them in fighting for Allah's cause, claiming they had been driven from their homes and families. The prophet questioned their sincerity, asking if they might refuse to fight if it were actually commanded. Despite their strong declaration of readiness due to their suffering, when fighting was ordained, most of them turned away, except for a small group. This highlights how initial enthusiasm needs to be tested and that true commitment is shown when facing the actual challenge. The verse concludes by stating that Allah is fully aware of those who turn away from their commitments.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الْمَلَإِ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ إِذْ قَالُوا لِنَبِيٍّ لَهُمُ ابْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكًا نُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۖ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ أَلَّا تُقَاتِلُوا ۖ قَالُوا وَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَائِنَا ۖ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"247","text":"Their Prophet said to them: \"Allah hath appointed Talut as king over you.\" They said: \"How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, with wealth in abundance?\" He said: \"Allah hath Chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: Allah Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things.\"","commentary":"Following their request for a king, their prophet informed the Children of Israel that Allah had appointed Talut as their king. However, instead of accepting Allah's choice, they objected, arguing that some among them were more deserving of leadership because Talut did not come from a prominent lineage or possess great wealth. The prophet explained that Allah had chosen Talut based on his abundant knowledge and physical strength, qualities essential for leadership, especially in battle. He reminded them that Allah grants authority to whoever He wills, as Allah is boundless in His giving and knows all things. This shows that true leadership qualities, chosen by divine wisdom, may differ from what people perceive as important, like wealth or social status.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا ۚ قَالُوا أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِنَ الْمَالِ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يُؤْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"248","text":"And (further) their Prophet said to them: \"A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith.\"","commentary":"As further evidence of Talut's appointment by Allah, their prophet gave them a physical sign: the return of the Ark of the Covenant. This Ark was a sacred object containing relics from Prophet Moses and Prophet Aaron's families, and its return would bring a sense of peace and reassurance from Allah. The verse describes the Ark being carried by angels. The prophet stated that this would be a clear sign of Talut's authority for them, if they were truly believers. This act, involving divine intervention (angels carrying the Ark), was meant to remove any doubt about Talut's divinely appointed leadership.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ التَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ آلُ مُوسَىٰ وَآلُ هَارُونَ تَحْمِلُهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"249","text":"When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: \"Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused.\" but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: \"This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.\" but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: \"How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere.\"","commentary":"After being appointed and gathering an army, Talut led them out. He subjected his troops to a test at a stream: they were commanded not to drink from it, except for a small sip. This test was designed to see who would be obedient and disciplined, showing self-control and loyalty. The verse tells us that almost all of them failed this test by drinking their fill, leaving only a small number who passed. Later, when this small group crossed the river and faced the much larger forces of their enemy, Goliath, many among them felt overwhelmed and doubted their ability to win. However, a very small core of those who were certain they would return to Allah (meaning they were fully committed and not afraid of death) reminded the others that victory is by Allah's will and that Allah is with those who are patient and steadfast. This highlights that strength is not just in numbers, but in faith, discipline, and reliance on Allah.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِالْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُمْ بِنَهَرٍ فَمَنْ شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَمَنْ لَمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي إِلَّا مَنِ اغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ ۚ فَشَرِبُوا مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ قَالُوا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا الْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ ۚ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو اللَّهِ كَمْ مِنْ فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ"},{"verse":"250","text":"When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: \"Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us against those that reject faith.\"","commentary":"As the small, faithful group under Talut advanced to meet the large enemy force led by Goliath, they turned to Allah in prayer. Their prayer was for strength, specifically asking Allah to grant them patience and steadfastness in the face of adversity, to make their steps firm during the battle, and to grant them victory over the opposing forces. This prayer demonstrates their deep reliance on Allah for support and victory, acknowledging that success in battle comes from Him.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا بَرَزُوا لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ قَالُوا رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"251","text":"By Allah's will they routed them; and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever (else) He willed. And did not Allah Check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds.","commentary":"The verse narrates the outcome: by Allah's will, the small group routed the enemy forces. It specifically mentions that David, who was part of Talut's army, killed Goliath. Following this victory, Allah granted David kingship and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. This shows that victory and authority come from Allah and that Allah chooses whom He blesses with leadership and knowledge. The verse then broadens the lesson, stating a universal principle: if Allah did not use groups of people to check or counterbalance one another, the earth would become full of corruption and disorder. This inherent struggle and dynamic interaction between different groups, directed by Allah's will, serves a purpose in preventing greater mischief. It concludes by reminding us that Allah is full of immense bounty and favor towards all creation.","arabic":"فَهَزَمُوهُمْ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَقَتَلَ دَاوُودُ جَالُوتَ وَآتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَهُ مِمَّا يَشَاءُ ۗ وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَفَسَدَتِ الْأَرْضُ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"252","text":"These are the Signs of Allah: we rehearse them to thee in truth: verily Thou art one of the messengers.","commentary":"This final verse in the passage affirms that the preceding stories and lessons are \"Signs of Allah\" – divine revelations that contain wisdom and guidance. It emphasizes that these accounts are conveyed in truth to the Prophet Muhammad. By stating, \"verily Thou art one of the messengers,\" it confirms the Prophet Muhammad's status as a messenger of Allah, chosen to receive and deliver these truths and divine signs to humanity, learning from the experiences of past nations as part of his mission.","arabic":"تِلْكَ آيَاتُ اللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَمِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ"},{"verse":"253","text":"Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy spirit.

If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Fulfilleth His plan.","commentary":"This verse speaks about the messengers sent by Allah, who were chosen individuals given a special nature and message. These messengers were all united in conveying the core message of Allah's oneness. The verse indicates that Allah elevated some messengers above others in status. It highlights specific examples: one to whom Allah spoke directly (understood to be Prophet Moses), others who were raised in rank, and Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, to whom clear signs (miracles and revelations like the Gospel) were given and who was strengthened by the holy spirit (understood as the Archangel Gabriel). The verse then notes that despite the clear messages brought by the prophets, their followers and succeeding generations differed, some believing and some rejecting the faith, which sometimes led to conflict and fighting. It affirms that this conflict was part of Allah's plan to establish truth and confront falsehood.","arabic":"تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۘ مِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَٰكِنِ اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَفَرَ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ"},{"verse":"254","text":"O ye who believe! Spend out of (the bounties) We have provided for you, before the Day comes when no bargaining (Will avail), nor friendship nor intercession. Those who reject Faith they are the wrong-doers.","commentary":"Following the discussion about the different messengers and the differences among their followers, this verse turns to address the believers directly. It urges them to spend generously from the wealth that Allah has provided them for His cause. This spending is encouraged as a way to support and defend the way of life revealed by Allah and to counter wrongdoing. The verse warns that there will be a specific Day when worldly means like trading, friendship, or intercession will be of no benefit. It labels those who reject faith as \"wrong-doers\" because they harm themselves by choosing a misguided path and harm others by misleading them and preventing them from receiving the guidance of Allah. This verse connects to the previous one by transitioning from the historical context of prophets and followers to a direct instruction for the current community of believers regarding their conduct and responsibility.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"255","text":"Allah!

Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).","commentary":"This powerful verse, known as the Verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi), summarizes fundamental Islamic principles about Allah's nature and attributes. It begins by declaring that only Allah is worthy of worship. It describes Him as the Ever-Living and the One who sustains all existence, emphasizing that He is not affected by slumber or sleep. It states that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him, highlighting His absolute ownership and control. The verse clarifies that no one can intercede with Allah without His permission. It affirms His complete knowledge of all things, past, present, and future, while human knowledge is limited to what He allows them to know. The verse mentions that Allah's Throne extends over the heavens and the earth. In Islamic belief, such attributes are affirmed as they appear in the Qur’an, without likening Allah to His creation or explaining how they occur. Rather, they reflect His majesty and uniqueness in a way beyond human comprehension. Muslims believe Allah’s attributes are accepted as revealed, without interpreting them metaphorically or anthropomorphically. It concludes by stating that maintaining the heavens and the earth does not weary Him, for He is the Most High and Most Great. This verse sets a profound foundation for understanding Allah's unique status and power, which is crucial for grasping the following verses about freedom of belief and guidance.","arabic":"اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ۚ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ ۚ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ ۚ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ"},{"verse":"256","text":"Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.","commentary":"Building upon the absolute and unique nature of Allah described in the previous verse, this verse establishes a fundamental principle: there is to be no compulsion in matters of religion. This is because the truth of belief in Allah is made distinct and clear from error. Accepting faith is a matter of personal conviction, addressing the human mind, emotions, and inherent nature. True faith involves rejecting \"taghut\" (a term referring to anything that exceeds its bounds and seeks to dominate, including tyranny, false deities, or systems that disregard divine law) and believing solely in Allah. The verse uses the image of grasping a \"most trustworthy hand-hold\" that never breaks to describe the security and certainty gained by someone who rejects falsehood and believes in Allah. It concludes by reaffirming that Allah hears everything and knows all things, both outwardly expressed and hidden within people's hearts.","arabic":"لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَدْ تَبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِنْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انْفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"257","text":"Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein (For ever).","commentary":"Following the declaration of \"no compulsion in religion\" and the clarity between truth and error, this verse vividly portrays the contrasting outcomes of choosing faith versus rejection. It explains that Allah is the supporter and guide for those who believe. He leads them out of various forms of darkness – including ignorance, confusion, and misguided ways of life – into the single path of light which is faith in Him and adherence to His guidance. In contrast, those who reject faith have evil forces (represented by \"false deities\" or *taghut*) as their patrons. These patrons lead them away from the light of innate understanding and clarity into layers of darkness, which can include caprice, deviation, tyranny, or servility, and ultimately lead to a dire outcome in the afterlife. The verse uses the singular \"light\" to represent the unified truth of faith and the plural \"darkness\" to represent the diverse forms of error and deviation.","arabic":"اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمُ الطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُمْ مِنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَاتِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"258","text":"Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power?

Said Abraham: \"But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.\" Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.","commentary":"This verse tells the story of an argument between Prophet Abraham and a king who disputed with him about Allah. The king had been granted power by Allah, but in his arrogance, he questioned Allah's authority. When Prophet Abraham said that his Lord is the one who gives life and causes death, the king arrogantly claimed he could also give life and cause death, likely referring to his ability to spare or execute people.\n\nTo counter this, Abraham presented a different challenge based on a universal natural phenomenon: he stated that Allah causes the sun to rise from the east and challenged the king to make it rise from the west. This challenge exposed the limit of the king's power, which was merely temporal authority over people, compared to Allah's absolute power over the entire universe and its laws. The disbeliever was left speechless, unable to answer this undeniable proof. The verse concludes by stating that Allah does not guide those who are unjust or reject the truth out of stubbornness. This story highlights that true power belongs only to Allah and that those granted authority should acknowledge Him, not dispute His sovereignty. It connects to the broader theme of understanding Allah's unique power and authority, which is a key theme in the preceding verses as well.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِي حَاجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِي يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِي وَأُمِيتُ ۖ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"259","text":"Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs.

He said: \"How long didst thou tarry (thus)?\" He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day.\" He said: \"Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.\" When this was shown clearly to him, he said: \"I know that Allah hath power over all things.\"","commentary":"Continuing the theme of Allah's power over life and death, this verse presents another example. It describes a man who passed by a completely ruined village and wondered how Allah could ever bring it back to life after such destruction. To demonstrate His power, Allah caused this man to die for a hundred years and then brought him back to life.\n\nWhen the man was revived, he was asked how long he had remained in that state. He replied that it felt like only a day or part of a day. Allah informed him he had been dead for a hundred years and showed him proofs: his food and drink were unspoiled, demonstrating that the passage of time under Allah's will could affect things differently, while his donkey was merely scattered bones. Then, before his eyes, Allah caused the bones of the donkey to come together and be clothed with flesh, bringing it back to life. This direct experience served as a sign for the man and for humanity, showing that Allah's power to resurrect is not bound by human perception of time or the limitations of decay and death. Witnessing this miracle, the man fully understood and declared, \"I know now that Allah hath power over all things.\" This narrative reinforces the concept of Allah's absolute power over creation, including bringing the dead back to life, following the discussion in the previous verse.","arabic":"أَوْ كَالَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْيِي هَٰذِهِ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا ۖ فَأَمَاتَهُ اللَّهُ مِائَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ ۖ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ ۖ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ ۖ قَالَ بَلْ لَبِثْتَ مِائَةَ عَامٍ فَانْظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ ۖ وَانْظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ ۖ وَانْظُرْ إِلَى الْعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنْشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا ۚ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"260","text":"When Abraham said: \"Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead, \" He replied: \"Have you no faith?\" He said \"Yes, but just to reassure my heart.\" Allah said, \"Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.\"","commentary":"This verse returns to Prophet Abraham, who asks Allah to show him how He brings the dead back to life. Allah asks him if he lacks faith, to which Prophet Abraham responds that his faith is strong, but he wishes for this experience to further reassure his heart and gain a deeper understanding. This shows that even those with strong faith may desire a closer, personal experience of Allah's power for spiritual tranquility.\n\nIn response, Allah instructs Prophet Abraham to take four birds, make sure he is familiar with them, then cut them into pieces and scatter parts of their bodies on different mountain tops. He was then instructed to call the birds back to him. The verse states that they came swiftly to him, fully alive again. This was a direct, visible demonstration of Allah's power to resurrect the dead, showing that He can reassemble and give life to fragmented remains across distances. The verse concludes by reminding us to know that Allah is \"Almighty\" (possessing ultimate power) and \"Wise\" (acting with perfect knowledge and purpose). Like the previous verse, this story serves as another powerful illustration of Allah's absolute power over life and death, confirming that resurrection is entirely within His capability, as He is the source of all creation and life.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۖ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِنْ ۖ قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِنْ لِيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِي ۖ قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِنَ الطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ اجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ادْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْيًا ۚ وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"261","text":"The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears, and each ear Hath a hundred grains. Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.","commentary":"This verse begins by offering a beautiful comparison for those who spend their wealth for the sake of Allah. It is likened to a single grain of corn that grows into seven ears, with each ear bearing a hundred grains. This is presented as a vivid image of abundant, multiplying growth and life. This parable illustrates the generous reward Allah gives to those who give charity sincerely. It emphasizes that Allah can increase this reward many times over for whomever He wills. We understand from this that Allah's bounty is vast and unlimited. The verse concludes by affirming that Allah cares for everything and knows all things, including people's intentions when they give.","arabic":"مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنْبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنْبُلَةٍ مِائَةُ حَبَّةٍ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يُضَاعِفُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"262","text":"Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah, and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury,-for them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"Following the previous verse's powerful image of multiplied reward, this verse explains *who* receives this generous increase. It specifies that the reward is for those who spend for Allah's cause and crucially, do not spoil their act of giving by reminding the recipient of their generosity or by causing them any hurt or harm. The reward for such sincere and respectful giving is assured with Allah. Furthermore, those who give in this manner are promised freedom from fear and grief, both in this life and the hereafter. This connects to the previous verse by clarifying the conditions under which the potential for manifold increase is fully realized.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ لَا يُتْبِعُونَ مَا أَنْفَقُوا مَنًّا وَلَا أَذًى ۙ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"263","text":"Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.","commentary":"Building upon the theme of the previous verse, which warned against harming the recipient of charity, this verse emphasizes the importance of good manners and compassion. It states that speaking kind words and overlooking people's shortcomings is better in Allah's sight than giving charity that is followed by causing hurt. This highlights that the manner in which charity is given, and one's general conduct, are extremely important. It then mentions Allah's attributes, stating that Allah is free of all needs and is Most Forbearing. This reminds us that Allah does not need our charity, and His patience and forgiveness are immense, setting an example for believers to emulate in dealing with others, especially those in need.","arabic":"قَوْلٌ مَعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَا أَذًى ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"264","text":"O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it (Just) a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the believers, warning them not to nullify the reward of their charity by boasting about it or causing harm, echoing the point made in the previous verses (262 and 263). It then presents a contrasting example: those who spend their wealth not for Allah, but merely to be seen and praised by others, and who lack genuine belief in Allah and the Day of Judgment. Such people's actions are likened to a hard, smooth rock covered with a thin layer of soil. When heavy rain falls (representing trials or the reality of the hereafter), the soil washes away, leaving the rock bare and unproductive. This illustrates that their deeds, though they may appear good externally, have no true foundation (belief) and therefore yield no lasting benefit or reward from Allah. Allah does not guide those who reject faith.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُبْطِلُوا صَدَقَاتِكُمْ بِالْمَنِّ وَالْأَذَىٰ كَالَّذِي يُنْفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَاءَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۖ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا ۖ لَا يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"265","text":"And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if it receives not Heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do.","commentary":"In contrast to the barren rock described in the previous verse, this verse offers a powerful image of the sincere giver. Those who spend their wealth seeking only Allah's pleasure and from deep within their faith are likened to a fertile garden situated on a hill. This garden yields abundantly, doubling its produce with heavy rain, and even a light drizzle is sufficient for its growth. This illustrates how sincere charity, rooted in faith, is always fruitful and blessed, regardless of the amount given. It produces great results in terms of reward and spiritual growth. The verse concludes by affirming that Allah sees and is fully aware of everything people do, including the sincerity behind their giving. This reinforces the connection to the previous verse by presenting the positive outcome of giving with right intention, directly contrasting the negative outcome of insincere giving.","arabic":"وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِنْ لَمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"266","text":"Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong (enough to look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up? Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His) Signs; that ye may consider.","commentary":"This verse uses another moving parable to make a point related to the value and security of one's deeds. It asks if anyone would wish to possess a flourishing garden with palms, vines, and streams, providing abundant fruits, only to see it completely destroyed by a fiery whirlwind precisely when they are old, weak, and unable to provide for their dependent children. This parable can be understood as representing the loss of the reward for one's good deeds (the garden) which were spoiled by something harmful (like boasting or causing injury, as mentioned in previous verses), especially at a time when one needs those rewards most (in the hereafter). The verse states that Allah presents such parables and signs clearly so that people may reflect deeply on their actions and their consequences. This connects to the preceding discussion by highlighting the vulnerability of one's good works if they are not built upon a solid foundation of sincere faith and given with good manners.","arabic":"أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَاءُ فَأَصَابَهَا إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَاحْتَرَقَتْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"267","text":"O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise.","commentary":"Shifting from the manner and intention of giving, this verse addresses the quality of what is given. It directs believers to give in charity from the good and lawful wealth they have earned or from the good produce that Allah has provided from the earth. It strongly prohibits intentionally seeking out poor or inferior items to give as charity, emphasizing that one should not give what they themselves would only accept reluctantly or with disdain. This sets a high standard for charity, reflecting respect for both Allah and the recipient. The verse concludes by reminding believers that Allah is free of all needs and is worthy of all praise, meaning He does not need our charity, but giving benefits the giver, and He is deserving of gratitude for the blessings He has bestowed. This builds upon the concept of giving for Allah's sake discussed earlier, adding the dimension of giving from the best one has.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْفِقُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّا أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ ۖ وَلَا تَيَمَّمُوا الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنْفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُمْ بِآخِذِيهِ إِلَّا أَنْ تُغْمِضُوا فِيهِ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ"},{"verse":"268","text":"The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.","commentary":"This verse speaks directly about the psychological barriers to generous giving. It reveals that Satan, \"the Evil one,\" tries to frighten people with the fear of becoming poor if they spend in charity. He also encourages them towards indecent or shameful behavior (like stinginess, hoarding, or seeking wealth unjustly). In clear contrast, Allah promises His forgiveness for shortcomings and abundant bounty for those who follow His path. This highlights a fundamental choice: succumbing to Satan's fear-mongering or trusting in Allah's promises of reward and provision. It serves as an encouragement to overcome reluctance to give. The verse reiterates that Allah cares for all and knows all things, providing reassurance that He is aware of the believer's struggle against temptation and their sincere efforts to give. This connects to the previous verse's directive to give generously from good things, by identifying the inner struggle that might prevent people from doing so.","arabic":"الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُمْ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَعِدُكُمْ مَغْفِرَةً مِنْهُ وَفَضْلًا ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"269","text":"He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the Message but men of understanding.","commentary":"This verse addresses the gift of wisdom, which can be seen as the ability to understand and apply the deeper truths and guidance revealed by Allah, including the principles related to giving and life's purpose. It states that Allah grants this profound gift to whomever He wills. Whoever receives wisdom has indeed been given an immense and overflowing benefit. The verse points out that only those with genuine understanding or sound minds are truly able to grasp the significance of Allah's messages and guidance, such as the contrasting paths of Satan and Allah mentioned in the previous verse. Wisdom helps one discern the true value of sincere giving and the emptiness of actions done for show or driven by fear.","arabic":"يُؤْتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَنْ يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّا أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"270","text":"And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure Allah knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers.","commentary":"Concluding this section on charity, this verse provides reassurance and a warning. It confirms that whatever believers spend, whether in obligatory charity (like Zakat), voluntary charity, or other acts of devotion, Allah is fully aware of it all. This underscores that no good deed done sincerely is ever overlooked by Allah. It then contrasts the state of the believers with that of the wrongdoers, stating that the wrongdoers will have no helpers. This implies that those who fail to live up to their obligations, perhaps by not giving sincerely or justly, will face consequences without support, unlike the believers whose deeds are known and rewarded by Allah. This serves as a summary reminder of accountability and Allah's complete knowledge regarding one's giving and devotion.","arabic":"وَمَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ نَفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُمْ مِنْ نَذْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُ ۗ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ"},{"verse":"271","text":"If ye disclose (acts of) charity, even so it is well, but if ye conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion on giving charity, building on the previous point about the importance of intention. It explains that while giving charity openly is acceptable, doing so discreetly, particularly for voluntary acts, is often better. Giving charity privately helps ensure sincerity and avoids any potential for showing off or embarrassing the recipient. However, giving charity openly is also good and can encourage others to do the same. Regardless of whether charity is given openly or in secret, Allah is fully aware of the act and the intention behind it. The verse also mentions that giving charity can help purify a person and reduce the burden of their shortcomings.","arabic":"إِنْ تُبْدُوا الصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِيَ ۖ وَإِنْ تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا الْفُقَرَاءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۚ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنْكُمْ مِنْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"272","text":"It is not required of thee (O Messenger), to set them on the right path, but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the \"Face\" of Allah. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly.","commentary":"This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad, clarifying that his role is to convey Allah's message, but the ultimate decision of who accepts guidance rests solely with Allah. This emphasizes that faith and guidance are gifts from Allah. The verse then returns to the theme of doing good, particularly charity. It teaches that any good you do, such as giving charity, is ultimately for your own benefit, both spiritually and in terms of the reward you will receive. It stresses that good deeds should be done purely for the sake of Allah, seeking His pleasure above all else. The verse provides reassurance that whatever good you give will be fully compensated, and no one will be treated unfairly in receiving their reward from Allah.","arabic":"لَيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِأَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ وَمَا تُنْفِقُونَ إِلَّا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"273","text":"(Charity is) for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, seeking (For trade or work): the ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well.","commentary":"This verse describes a specific group of people who are particularly deserving of charity. These are individuals who are in need but are limited in their ability to travel or work to earn a living, especially those whose situation is connected to their dedication to serving Allah's cause or community. The verse highlights their dignity and self-respect, noting that they maintain a modest demeanor and avoid aggressively begging from people. Because of their self-restraint, those who are unaware of their true situation might mistake them for not being in need. The verse implies that a discerning person can recognize their need. It concludes by assuring that any good given to these individuals is known to Allah, Who will certainly reward it. This verse connects back to the broader theme of charity by identifying worthy recipients who might otherwise be overlooked.","arabic":"لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الَّذِينَ أُحْصِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِي الْأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَاءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُمْ بِسِيمَاهُمْ لَا يَسْأَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا ۗ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"274","text":"Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse concludes the section on the ethics and rewards of charity by providing a comprehensive summary. It promises a great reward from Allah for those who consistently give charity from their wealth, regardless of when they do it (day or night) or how they do it (secretly or openly). The verse gives reassurance that those who give in this manner will have their reward secured with Allah and will experience no fear or grief in the Hereafter. This final verse serves as a powerful encouragement, promising peace and security as a result of sincere and consistent charitable giving, linking back to the earlier promises of reward and the importance of intention.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"275","text":"Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury,\" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).","commentary":"This verse follows a passage discussing charity and introduces a strong contrast by addressing usury, which is called *riba* in Arabic. While charity is seen as giving and cooperation, usury involves charging an increase on money owed, regardless of the borrower's situation. The verse presents a very striking image of those who engage in usury, comparing them to someone afflicted by the touch of evil, suggesting a state of confusion or imbalance. This vivid comparison is used to show the severe consequences and harmful nature of usury. The commentary explains that this image highlights what happens both in this life and potentially in the hereafter. People who practice usury are described as claiming that \"trade is like usury,\" but the verse clearly distinguishes between the two, stating that Allah has allowed trade but forbidden usury. The key difference, as explained later in the commentary, is that trade involves risk for both parties and real effort, while usury guarantees a gain for the lender regardless of the borrower's outcome. The verse offers a way out for those who have practiced usury: if they stop after receiving this guidance from Allah, their past actions are left to Allah's judgment. However, it issues a strong warning that those who return to the practice of usury after being informed are destined for the Fire. This verse sets a clear distinction between the permissible act of trade and the prohibited practice of usury, emphasizing the grave consequences of ignoring this divine instruction.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَا لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَا ۗ وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا ۚ فَمَنْ جَاءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ فَانْتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"276","text":"Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.","commentary":"Continuing the theme from the previous verse which contrasted usury and trade, this verse further highlights the fundamental difference between usury and charity (which is known as *zakat* and general charitable giving). It states that Allah removes blessing from usury, meaning that despite any apparent gains, usury does not lead to true well-being or lasting prosperity, either for the individual or society. In contrast, Allah blesses and increases the reward for charitable deeds. This implies that giving in charity, though it reduces wealth outwardly, brings spiritual and material growth in ways not immediately apparent, fostering a healthy society. The verse concludes by stating that Allah does not love those who are ungrateful and persist in wrongdoing, implicitly linking the practice of usury to a lack of gratitude for Allah's blessings and to harmful actions. This verse reinforces the ethical framework where generosity and fair exchange are favored over exploitative practices like usury, showing their different impacts on individuals and the community, and on their relationship with Allah.","arabic":"يَمْحَقُ اللَّهُ الرِّبَا وَيُرْبِي الصَّدَقَاتِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ"},{"verse":"277","text":"Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"Following the strong condemnation of usury and its practitioners in the preceding verses, this verse presents a contrasting picture of those who live according to Islamic principles. It describes believers who not only have faith but also perform righteous deeds, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity (zakat). These are highlighted as core pillars of the Muslim community and key aspects of an Islamic way of life that stands in opposition to the system based on usury. The verse promises such individuals their reward from Allah and assures them that they will experience \"no fear, nor shall they grieve.\" This state of peace and security is presented as a direct result of living a life of faith, righteousness, prayer, and charity. The commentary highlights that charity, in particular, forms the basis of a caring society where usury becomes unnecessary. The tranquility and happiness promised here are presented as the fruit of a life built on submission to Allah's will and mutual support within the community, contrasting sharply with the anxiety and instability associated with usury described earlier.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"278","text":"O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if ye are indeed believers.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses those who believe and reinforces the message against usury. It emphasizes the importance of fearing Allah (being conscious of Allah's presence and commands) as a motivation for action. It then issues a clear command to give up any remaining demands for usury that are still outstanding. The phrase \"if ye are indeed believers\" serves as a test of true faith, indicating that abandoning usury is an essential requirement for someone claiming to be a Muslim. The commentary explains that this verse makes the rejection of usury a condition for authentic belief, leaving no room for people to verbally declare faith while practicing something Allah has forbidden. This instruction marked a turning point for the early Muslim community, demanding that they transition immediately to a system free from usury, showing that Islamic faith is meant to govern all aspects of life, including economic dealings.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَذَرُوا مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الرِّبَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"279","text":"If ye do it not, Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger: But if ye turn back, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.","commentary":"This verse follows the command to abandon usury and presents the severe consequence of not doing so. It issues a strong warning: if believers do not give up the remaining demands for usury, they are essentially declaring \"war from Allah and His Messenger.\" This is a terrifying prospect, highlighting the gravity of persisting in this forbidden practice. The commentary explains this is a warning of total condemnation for societies based on usury, affecting psychological, economic, and emotional aspects of life, leading to conflict and instability. However, the verse immediately provides an alternative: if they repent and turn away from usury, they are entitled to retrieve their original capital sums without any increase. The principle is clearly stated: \"Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.\" This ensures that while usurious gains are abolished, the initial loan amount is protected, guaranteeing a fair outcome where no one is wronged. The commentary emphasizes that the aim is to purify society and guide humanity towards a just system based on Allah's guidance.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"280","text":"If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time Till it is easy for him to repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only knew.","commentary":"Following the strong directives against usury and the reminder about claiming only the principal, this verse addresses the situation where a debtor is unable to repay a loan due to financial difficulty. It provides a merciful guideline, instructing creditors to grant the debtor more time until their circumstances improve and repayment becomes easy. Going beyond merely granting delay, the verse suggests an even better action: waiving the debt entirely as an act of charity. The verse states that doing so is \"best for you if ye only knew,\" implying hidden benefits and rewards for the creditor, perhaps in this life and certainly in the hereafter. The commentary highlights that this evokes an atmosphere of tolerance and compassion, contrasting sharply with the harshness of usury. It reinforces the Islamic principle of mutual support and emphasizes that the community should help those in genuine hardship, discouraging any form of harassment or pressure on an insolvent debtor.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ ۚ وَأَنْ تَصَدَّقُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"281","text":"And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly.","commentary":"This final verse in the passage serves as a powerful concluding reminder, shifting focus from worldly transactions and their consequences to the ultimate accountability in the hereafter. It urges everyone to \"fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah.\" This refers to the Day of Judgment, when all individuals will stand before Allah to be judged for their actions in this life. The verse emphasizes a fundamental principle of that Day: \"every soul shall be paid what it earned,\" meaning each person will receive the full consequence of their deeds, whether good or bad. Crucially, it adds, \"and none shall be dealt with unjustly.\" This assurance highlights Allah's perfect justice, where no one will be wronged by receiving less reward than they deserve or more punishment than they earned. The commentary notes that this reminder about the fearful Day of Judgment serves as a strong motivation, particularly in the context of financial dealings discussed previously, encouraging people to act justly and charitably, knowing they will be held accountable for their choices regarding wealth and their treatment of others. It underscores that living according to Allah's guidance, especially in matters like usury and debt, is ultimately for one's own benefit on the Day of Reckoning.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"282","text":"O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write: as Allah Has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear His Lord Allah, and not diminish aught of what he owes. If they party liable is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable Himself to dictate, Let his guardian dictate faithfully, and get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (For evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of Allah, More suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Good that teaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things. If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin. And Allah knoweth all that ye do.","commentary":"This verse provides comprehensive guidance for transactions involving future obligations, such as loans or deferred payments. It establishes the principle that these agreements should be put in writing, setting a fixed period for their fulfillment. This is seen as more just in the sight of Allah, providing stronger evidence and helping to prevent misunderstandings.\n\nThe verse instructs that an impartial scribe should write down the agreement accurately. It emphasizes that anyone with the ability to write, which is a skill granted by Allah, should not refuse to act as a scribe when needed. The person who owes the debt should dictate the terms, and they are reminded to be mindful of Allah, their Lord, and not to conceal or reduce any part of the obligation. If the debtor is unable to dictate due to incapacity or weakness, their guardian or representative should do so fairly.\n\nThe verse also requires securing witnesses for the contract. The standard is two men. If two men are not available, then one man and two women are to be called as witnesses, chosen from those deemed trustworthy. The reason mentioned in the commentary for having two women is to ensure that if one should forget or err in recalling details, the other can remind her, thereby safeguarding the accuracy of the testimony in a legal matter. The verse stresses that witnesses should not refuse when asked to give testimony, as it is a duty to help establish justice and preserve rights.\n\nIt advises against thinking any debt is too small to be recorded, reinforcing that writing it down is better and less likely to lead to disputes. For transactions conducted on the spot, where goods and payment are exchanged immediately, writing is not required, though witnesses are still encouraged. The verse concludes by protecting the roles of the scribe and witnesses, stating they should not be harmed for fulfilling their duties. Harming them is considered an act of disobedience to Allah. It reminds believers to be conscious of Allah, who teaches us and has complete knowledge of everything we do.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا تَدَايَنْتُمْ بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى فَاكْتُبُوهُ ۚ وَلْيَكْتُبْ بَيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ ۚ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا أَوْ ضَعِيفًا أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَاسْتَشْهِدُوا شَهِيدَيْنِ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَامْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّنْ تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَاءِ أَنْ تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الْأُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَاءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُوا ۚ وَلَا تَسْأَمُوا أَنْ تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَىٰ أَجَلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَادَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰ أَلَّا تَرْتَابُوا ۖ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلَّا تَكْتُبُوهَا ۗ وَأَشْهِدُوا إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ ۚ وَلَا يُضَارَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلَا شَهِيدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"283","text":"If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, Let the trustee (Faithfully) discharge His trust, and let him fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it,- His heart is tainted with sin. And Allah Knoweth all that ye do.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific situation related to transactions, particularly when traveling and a scribe is not available, building upon the detailed instructions in the previous verse. In such circumstances, the verse allows for a pledge or security to be given as a guarantee for the debt instead of a written contract. This serves as a practical solution when formal documentation is difficult.\n\nIt then speaks more broadly about situations where trust is involved. If someone is entrusted with something, whether it's the security for a debt or any other item, they are called upon to fulfill that trust faithfully and be mindful of Allah, their Lord. Both the person holding the security and the person who borrowed the money are considered trustees in their respective roles.\n\nThe verse follows this by emphasizing the importance of giving truthful testimony. It states that concealing evidence is a serious matter, tainting the heart with sin. It concludes with a reminder that Allah has full knowledge of all actions, implying that even hidden intentions regarding trust or testimony are known to Him and will be accounted for. This connects to the broader theme of accountability before Allah.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُوا كَاتِبًا فَرِهَانٌ مَقْبُوضَةٌ ۖ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِي اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ ۗ وَلَا تَكْتُمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ ۚ وَمَنْ يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"284","text":"To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah Calleth you to account for it. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and punisheth whom He pleaseth, for Allah hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to the ultimate reality of Allah's sovereignty and knowledge, providing a powerful conclusion to the preceding verses about financial dealings, trust, and testimony. It declares that everything in the vast expanse of the heavens and the earth belongs solely to Allah.\n\nIt then states that Allah knows not only our outward actions but also our inner thoughts and intentions, whether we express them openly or keep them hidden. He will hold everyone accountable for what is in their minds and what they do. This serves as a reminder that our inner state, our intentions regarding matters like honesty in business or truthfulness in testimony (discussed in the previous verses), are known to Allah.\n\nThe verse affirms Allah's absolute power and authority, stating that He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. This highlights that while there is accountability, there is also the possibility of forgiveness, all according to Allah's perfect will and power over all things. This conclusion ties the practical guidance on human interactions and responsibilities (as given in verses like 282 and 283) to the fundamental Islamic belief in Allah's complete ownership, knowledge, and control over everything, emphasizing the link between worldly conduct and divine accountability.","arabic":"لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَإِنْ تُبْدُوا مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ اللَّهُ ۖ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"285","text":"The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers. \"We make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His messengers.\" And they say: \"We hear, and we obey: (We seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys.\"","commentary":"This verse speaks about the faith of the Messenger (the Prophet Muhammad) and the believers who follow him. It tells us that the Messenger believes in the revelation he receives from Allah, and the believers share this same deep faith. It outlines the core beliefs that every Muslim holds: belief in Allah, in His angels, in His revealed books, and in all of His messengers.\n\nMuslims believe that all messengers, from the Prophet Adam to the Prophet Muhammad, brought messages from the same Divine source. We do not make a distinction between them; they are all respected and believed in.\n\nFollowing this declaration of faith, the verse describes the attitude of believers: they say, \"We hear, and we obey.\" This signifies their submission to Allah's commands as revealed through His messengers and books. They also seek Allah's forgiveness, recognizing their human imperfections. Finally, they affirm their certainty that everyone will ultimately return to Allah. This understanding that life is a journey back to the Divine source shapes a believer's perspective and actions. This verse connects back to the beginning of the Sura, which also speaks about the core beliefs of those who are guided by the Qur'an.","arabic":"آمَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۚ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْ رُسُلِهِ ۚ وَقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"286","text":"On no soul doth Allah Place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray:) \"Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden Like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Help us against those who stand against faith.\"","commentary":"This verse offers reassurance and speaks about individual responsibility and Allah's mercy. It tells us that Allah does not ask any soul to bear a responsibility or face a trial that is beyond its capability. This is a source of comfort and confidence for believers, knowing that Allah is aware of their strengths and limitations.\n\nIt also emphasizes the principle of individual accountability: a person will be rewarded for the good they do and will face the consequences for the wrong they do. This highlights that each person is responsible for their own actions and will stand before Allah individually.\n\nFollowing these principles of justice and capacity, the verse then presents a heartfelt prayer from the believers. They ask Allah not to hold them accountable for mistakes made out of forgetfulness or error, acknowledging that these are part of human nature. They also pray not to be tested with burdens similar to those placed upon some earlier communities, recognizing the lessons from history about the consequences faced by those who were disobedient or stubborn. They further ask Allah not to burden them with more than they can physically and spiritually handle. Finally, they earnestly seek Allah's pardon, forgiveness, and mercy, recognizing that ultimate success and deliverance come through His grace. The prayer concludes by affirming Allah as their Protector and asking for His help against those who stand against faith, which relates to the Sura's broader themes of the struggle for truth and the establishment of Allah's guidance on earth. This prayer encapsulates the believers' humility, their reliance on Allah's mercy, and their quest for divine support in facing challenges.","arabic":"لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِنْ نَسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ ۖ وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا ۚ أَنْتَ مَوْلَانَا فَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"}];
