    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin.","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing all humanity, reminding everyone that they originate from a single source and share a common Creator, Allah. It emphasizes the importance of revering Allah, the One who created us from a single person and from that created a mate, and from these two, spread forth countless men and women. This highlights the shared origin and unity of humankind. The verse also connects the reverence for Allah with the importance of respecting kinship ties, as these relationships stem from this shared beginning. It encourages people to be mindful of the bonds of family and community, reminding them that Allah is always aware of their actions and intentions. This introductory verse sets the stage for the social and legal principles that follow in the Sura, grounding them in the fundamental relationship between humanity and its Creator, and the interconnectedness of all people.","arabic":"وَآتُوا الْيَتَامَىٰ أَمْوَالَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَتَبَدَّلُوا الْخَبِيثَ بِالطَّيِّبِ ۖ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَمْوَالِكُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوبًا كَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"2","text":"If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.","commentary":"Following the broad principles in the first verse, this verse introduces specific guidance regarding the care of orphans. It instructs guardians to return the property of orphans to them when they reach maturity. It sternly warns against replacing the valuable assets of orphans with one's own inferior items, or mixing their wealth with one's own in order to misuse or consume it. The verse explicitly states that such actions are a grave wrong. This guidance highlights the Islamic emphasis on protecting the rights of the vulnerable and dealing justly, particularly concerning the property of those unable to manage it themselves.","arabic":"وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تُقْسِطُوا فِي الْيَتَامَىٰ فَانْكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا فَوَاحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلَّا تَعُولُوا"},{"verse":"3","text":"And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion from the previous verse, particularly addressing the situation of guardians who might be tempted to marry an orphan girl under their care, perhaps due to her property or other reasons, without ensuring fair treatment regarding her dower (a gift given to the wife) or overall rights. It provides a practical solution: if a guardian fears they cannot be just towards an orphan girl, they are advised to marry other women who are agreeable to them, up to four. However, the verse immediately qualifies this by stating that if one fears they cannot treat multiple wives justly, then they should marry only one. This condition of maintaining justice is paramount. The verse allows marrying up to four wives only if a man can be just to them, otherwise, he must limit himself to one wife or those in his care through specific legal means (referred to as \"those whom your right hands possess\" – this historical category of individuals is understood within Islam to be a complex matter related to captives of war, and is not comparable to modern slavery, with Islamic teachings introducing various paths to freedom and protection, though the concept itself can be sensitive). The connection here is the theme of preventing injustice, particularly towards vulnerable women, including orphans and wives. This verse aims to guide people towards maintaining fairness in marital relationships.","arabic":"وَآتُوا النِّسَاءَ صَدُقَاتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً ۚ فَإِنْ طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ مِنْهُ نَفْسًا فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئًا مَرِيئًا"},{"verse":"4","text":"To those weak of understanding Make not over your property, which Allah hath made a means of support for you, but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.","commentary":"Building on the theme of women's rights in marriage introduced in the previous verse, this verse specifically addresses the dower (often translated as \"bridal gift\" or \"mahr\"). It clarifies that the dower is a right belonging solely to the woman herself, to be given to her by the husband as a genuine gift upon marriage. It emphasizes that this is her property. It also adds that if, of her own free will and without any pressure, she chooses to give back a portion of it to her husband, he may accept and benefit from it. This verse aimed to correct pre-Islamic practices where dowry might be taken by the woman's guardian or treated as a price paid for her, establishing her independent right to her financial settlement in marriage.","arabic":"وَلَا تُؤْتُوا السُّفَهَاءَ أَمْوَالَكُمُ الَّتِي جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ قِيَامًا وَارْزُقُوهُمْ فِيهَا وَاكْسُوهُمْ وَقُولُوا لَهُمْ قَوْلًا مَعْرُوفًا"},{"verse":"5","text":"Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account.","commentary":"This verse addresses the management of property belonging to individuals who are deemed \"weak of understanding\" and unable to manage their finances wisely. It instructs guardians not to hand over the property directly to them, as Allah has designated wealth as a means of support for the community and individuals, and it should not be squandered. Instead, the guardian should use the property to provide for the individual's needs, such as food and clothing, and ensure they are treated with kindness and fairness. This verse continues the broader theme of protecting the vulnerable and managing wealth responsibly for the benefit of those who cannot do so for themselves, expanding the scope beyond just orphans to include others who may need financial guardianship.","arabic":"وَابْتَلُوا الْيَتَامَىٰ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغُوا النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوهَا إِسْرَافًا وَبِدَارًا أَنْ يَكْبَرُوا ۚ وَمَنْ كَانَ غَنِيًّا فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ ۖ وَمَنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُوا عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ حَسِيبًا"},{"verse":"6","text":"From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large,-a determinate share.","commentary":"This verse provides further detailed instructions regarding the care of orphans' property, building on the guidance in Verse 2. It directs guardians to test the orphans in their care as they approach maturity (indicated by reaching a marriageable age) to assess their sound judgment and ability to manage their own affairs. Once they demonstrate maturity and sound judgment, their property must be fully returned to them. The verse reiterates the prohibition against wastefully or hastily spending the orphan's property before they come of age. It also provides guidance on the guardian's compensation: a wealthy guardian should generously abstain from taking any payment, while a poor guardian may take a just and reasonable amount for their efforts. When the property is handed over, witnesses should be present to ensure accountability. The verse concludes by reminding everyone that Allah is sufficient as an ultimate reckoner, emphasizing that all actions are known to Him and will be accounted for. This detailed guidance reinforces the strong commitment to protecting the rights and property of orphans until they can manage it themselves.","arabic":"لِلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالْأَقْرَبُونَ وَلِلنِّسَاءِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالْأَقْرَبُونَ مِمَّا قَلَّ مِنْهُ أَوْ كَثُرَ ۚ نَصِيبًا مَفْرُوضًا"},{"verse":"7","text":"But if at the time of division other relatives, or orphans or poor, are present, feed them out of the (property), and speak to them words of kindness and justice.","commentary":"Transitioning from the management of orphans' property, this verse introduces the fundamental principle of inheritance. It clearly establishes that both men and women have a rightful share in the property left behind by their parents and close relatives. This share is fixed and determined by Allah, regardless of whether the inherited property is large or small. Historically, in many pre-Islamic societies, women were often denied inheritance rights, or young boys received little share. This verse marks a significant change by explicitly granting women a share and establishing a clear right for all eligible relatives, setting the stage for the detailed distribution rules that follow.","arabic":"وَإِذَا حَضَرَ الْقِسْمَةَ أُولُو الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينُ فَارْزُقُوهُمْ مِنْهُ وَقُولُوا لَهُمْ قَوْلًا مَعْرُوفًا"},{"verse":"8","text":"Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear Allah, and speak words of appropriate (comfort).","commentary":"While Verse 7 established the principle of fixed shares for designated heirs, this verse adds a layer of social consideration during the distribution of inheritance. It encourages those dividing the estate that if other relatives who are not direct heirs, or orphans or poor people, are present, they should be given something from the property as an act of kindness and justice. This is seen as a way to foster goodwill, prevent feelings of deprivation among those not receiving a formal share, and extend support to the needy, embedding compassion within the process of distributing wealth.","arabic":"وَلْيَخْشَ الَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُوا مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّةً ضِعَافًا خَافُوا عَلَيْهِمْ فَلْيَتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْيَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا"},{"verse":"9","text":"Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, eat up a Fire into their own bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire!","commentary":"This verse offers a powerful ethical appeal to those responsible for handling or dividing an estate, particularly when dealing with the property of orphans or leaving behind dependents. It urges them to consider how they would feel if they were leaving behind their own young, vulnerable children without protection. Just as they would fear for their own helpless family, they should have the same fear regarding the welfare of the orphans or dependents they are responsible for or whose estate they are managing. The verse directly connects this feeling of empathy to the reverence for Allah, instructing them to fear Allah and to speak kindly and justly to those involved, especially the vulnerable. This serves as a strong moral safeguard against mistreating orphans or mismanaging estates.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ الْيَتَامَىٰ ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا ۖ وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا"},{"verse":"10","text":"Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases ('s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Al-wise.","commentary":"Following the ethical appeal and warning in the previous verse, this verse delivers a severe warning about the consequence of unjustly consuming the property of orphans. It uses vivid imagery to convey the gravity of this act, describing those who do so as essentially swallowing fire into their own bodies. It states that they will ultimately face a painful torment in the afterlife. This strong condemnation underscores the seriousness with which Islam regards the violation of the rights of orphans and serves as a powerful deterrent against such injustice. It links the worldly act of consuming the orphan's wealth to a tangible, terrible consequence in the hereafter.","arabic":"يُوصِيكُمُ اللَّهُ فِي أَوْلَادِكُمْ ۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ ۚ فَإِنْ كُنَّ نِسَاءً فَوْقَ اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ ۖ وَإِنْ كَانَتْ وَاحِدَةً فَلَهَا النِّصْفُ ۚ وَلِأَبَوَيْهِ لِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِنْ كَانَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَوَرِثَهُ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ الثُّلُثُ ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ لَهُ إِخْوَةٌ فَلِأُمِّهِ السُّدُسُ ۚ مِنْ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِي بِهَا أَوْ دَيْنٍ ۗ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَاؤُكُمْ لَا تَدْرُونَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ لَكُمْ نَفْعًا ۚ فَرِيضَةً مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"11","text":"In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one). Thus is it ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Most Forbearing.","commentary":"This verse begins to lay out the system of inheritance in Islam, which is seen as a fundamental aspect of social and economic justice within the family. It follows the earlier discussion on protecting the vulnerable, like orphans (verses 2-6, 9-10), and establishing fairness, especially towards women (verse 4). This specific verse focuses on the shares of children and parents when someone passes away.\n\nAllah instructs that when both male and female children inherit, a son's share is equivalent to that of two daughters. This isn't about favoring one gender but reflects the differing financial responsibilities placed upon men and women in the Islamic social system. Men are obligated to provide for their wives and children, while women are not required to financially support anyone, even themselves if they have male relatives who can support them.\n\nThe verse details the shares for daughters if there are no sons: if two or more daughters inherit, they receive two-thirds of the estate collectively, and if there is only one daughter, she receives half.\n\nIt also specifies the shares for the deceased's parents: each parent receives one-sixth if the deceased has children. If the deceased has no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother receives one-third. If the deceased has siblings, the mother's share is reduced to one-sixth.\n\nImportantly, the verse states that all these distributions happen only after any debts of the deceased have been paid and any legitimate bequests (wills, within limits) have been fulfilled. Debts take absolute priority.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that these are fixed, ordained shares from Allah, reminding people that they may not fully grasp which relatives are ultimately most beneficial to them. This highlights the wisdom and complete knowledge of Allah in determining these matters, unlike human systems which are based on limited understanding.","arabic":"وَلَكُمْ نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزْوَاجُكُمْ إِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَلَكُمُ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْنَ ۚ مِنْ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِينَ بِهَا أَوْ دَيْنٍ ۚ وَلَهُنَّ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ الثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ ۚ مِنْ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ تُوصُونَ بِهَا أَوْ دَيْنٍ ۗ وَإِنْ كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ كَلَالَةً أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ ۚ فَإِنْ كَانُوا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ فِي الثُّلُثِ ۚ مِنْ بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصَىٰ بِهَا أَوْ دَيْنٍ غَيْرَ مُضَارٍّ ۚ وَصِيَّةً مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement.","commentary":"Building upon the inheritance rules in the previous verse (Verse 11), this verse outlines the shares for spouses and for siblings in specific situations.\n\nIt explains that a husband inherits half of his deceased wife's estate if she leaves no children. If she has children (from him or a previous marriage), his share is one-fourth. Similarly, a wife inherits one-fourth of her deceased husband's estate if he leaves no children. If he has children (from her or another wife), her share is one-eighth. This share is divided equally among multiple wives, if any.\n\nAgain, the verse stresses that these shares are distributed only after paying debts and fulfilling legitimate bequests, just as mentioned in Verse 11.\n\nThe verse then addresses the case of someone who dies leaving behind neither parents nor children (a situation known as *kalālah*). If such a person leaves a brother or a sister, each receives one-sixth. If there are more than two siblings, they share a third of the estate collectively. The commentary notes that this specific ruling applies to half-siblings on the mother's side; inheritance rules for full siblings or half-siblings on the father's side are explained elsewhere (in a later verse of this Sura).\n\nThe verse concludes by reiterating that these are commandments from Allah, emphasizing His perfect knowledge and abundant grace in establishing these detailed and just rules for human affairs.","arabic":"تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ"},{"verse":"13","text":"But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"Following the detailed rules of inheritance laid out in the preceding verses (Verse 11 and 12), this verse emphasizes the profound importance of adhering to these and all other divine laws. It declares that these rules are \"limits set by Allah,\" meaning they are boundaries and guidelines established by the Divine.\n\nObeying these limits and obeying Allah and His Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) is presented as a path to immense reward: entry into Paradise (Gardens) where one will live forever, a state described as the \"supreme achievement\" or ultimate success. This connection between following seemingly specific legal rules (like inheritance) and achieving ultimate salvation underscores a core principle in Islam: that submitting to Allah's authority in all aspects of life, big or small, is the essence of faith and leads to the best outcome in the Hereafter.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ نَارًا خَالِدًا فِيهَا وَلَهُ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ"},{"verse":"14","text":"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.","commentary":"This verse starkly contrasts the outcome of obedience described in Verse 13. It describes the consequence for those who choose to disobey Allah and His Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) and violate the boundaries or limits set by Allah, such as those just described concerning inheritance.\n\nThe consequence is entry into the Fire (Hellfire) to remain there permanently, accompanied by a humiliating punishment. This serves as a serious warning and reinforces the critical importance of adhering to Allah's commandments. Together, Verses 13 and 14 frame the legal instructions within a broader context of accountability to Allah and the ultimate destiny determined by one's response to His guidance and limits. They highlight that accepting and implementing Allah's law, even in matters of personal or social regulation, is a fundamental aspect of faith with eternal consequences.","arabic":"وَاللَّاتِي يَأْتِينَ الْفَاحِشَةَ مِنْ نِسَائِكُمْ فَاسْتَشْهِدُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةً مِنْكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ شَهِدُوا فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ فِي الْبُيُوتِ حَتَّىٰ يَتَوَفَّاهُنَّ الْمَوْتُ أَوْ يَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ لَهُنَّ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"15","text":"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse addresses specific instances of gross immoral conduct involving women within the early Muslim community. It outlines an initial measure: requiring the testimony of four trustworthy witnesses from the community to establish guilt. If found guilty based on this strict requirement, the woman was to be confined to her home. This confinement was to continue until her passing or until Allah revealed a different ruling. This verse marks a first step in establishing guidelines to maintain social purity, emphasizing the importance of rigorous proof before consequences are applied, and hinting that these rulings might be subject to further divine guidance.","arabic":"وَاللَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَانِهَا مِنْكُمْ فَآذُوهُمَا ۖ فَإِنْ تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُوا عَنْهُمَا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"16","text":"Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.","commentary":"Following the instruction regarding women in the previous verse, this verse addresses similar conduct involving two men from the community. It directs that they both be punished. The commentary suggests that this initial punishment was perhaps less severe, involving verbal rebuke or light physical correction. Crucially, the verse emphasizes that if these individuals sincerely repent and change their behavior, they should be left alone, and punishment should cease. This highlights the emphasis Islam places on repentance and reform. The verse concludes by affirming that Allah is the One who accepts repentance and is Most Merciful, reminding believers to also be merciful and forgiving towards those who genuinely seek to reform. This verse, like the previous one, indicates early steps in social regulation, which were later clarified and expanded upon in subsequent revelations.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا التَّوْبَةُ عَلَى اللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السُّوءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ فَأُولَٰئِكَ يَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"17","text":"Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, \"Now have I repented indeed;\" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous.","commentary":"Building on the theme of repentance mentioned in the previous verse, this verse clarifies whose repentance is accepted by Allah. It explains that Allah readily accepts the repentance of those who commit wrongdoings out of ignorance or momentary lapse and who then quickly turn back to Him in regret and seek forgiveness. This implies that the window for genuine repentance is open as long as one is in a state where they can truly reflect and change their life, not just when death is imminent. Such sincere and timely repentance earns Allah's mercy. The verse concludes by stating that Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom, assuring believers that His acceptance of repentance is based on His perfect understanding of their hearts and intentions.","arabic":"وَلَيْسَتِ التَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّي تُبْتُ الْآنَ وَلَا الَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"18","text":"O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.","commentary":"In contrast to the timely and sincere repentance discussed in the previous verse, this verse describes two situations where repentance is not accepted. First, it states that repentance offered only at the very moment of death, after a lifetime of deliberate wrongdoing, is not effective. This is because such a declaration is made out of necessity, not from a genuine change of heart or a desire to reform one's life. Second, it clarifies that repentance is also not accepted from those who die while actively rejecting faith in Allah. For these individuals, a severe punishment awaits in the afterlife. This verse underscores the importance of conscious choice and genuine commitment to faith and righteous living throughout one's life.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَرِثُوا النِّسَاءَ كَرْهًا ۖ وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا بِبَعْضِ مَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُبَيِّنَةٍ ۚ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِنْ كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا"},{"verse":"19","text":"But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, Take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong?","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to the rights and treatment of women within marriage, specifically addressing practices prevalent before Islam. It prohibits the custom of inheriting women against their will upon the death of a male relative. It also forbids husbands from treating their wives harshly with the intention of forcing them to give up part of the dowry (a gift from the husband to the wife as part of the marriage contract). An exception is mentioned if the wife has been clearly guilty of severe misconduct; however, even then, harshness is generally discouraged. The verse strongly emphasizes that husbands should live with their wives kindly and equitably. It offers profound advice: even if a husband dislikes something about his wife, he should be patient, as Allah might bring about great good through that situation, which may not be immediately apparent. This encourages maintaining the marital bond with patience and hope in Allah's wisdom, rather than dissolving it impulsively based on changing emotions.","arabic":"وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمُ اسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَآتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنْطَارًا فَلَا تَأْخُذُوا مِنْهُ شَيْئًا ۚ أَتَأْخُذُونَهُ بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"20","text":"And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they have Taken from you a solemn covenant?","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's mention of dowry and fair treatment, this verse addresses the situation when a man decides to divorce his wife and marry another woman. It explicitly forbids him from taking back any part of the dowry he had given to his first wife, no matter how substantial it was. It rhetorically questions how anyone could take back such a gift, implying that doing so would be a grave injustice and a clear sin. This reinforces the principle that the dowry is the wife's right and property, not a conditional payment or something to be reclaimed upon divorce, thereby safeguarding the wife's financial security and dignity.","arabic":"وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُ وَقَدْ أَفْضَىٰ بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَأَخَذْنَ مِنْكُمْ مِيثَاقًا غَلِيظًا"},{"verse":"21","text":"And marry not women whom your fathers married,- except what is past: It was shameful and odious,- an abominable custom indeed.","commentary":"This verse continues the theme from the previous one, further emphasizing the seriousness of the marital bond and why it is wrong for a man to reclaim the dowry upon divorce. It highlights two significant aspects of the relationship: the intimate connection that has occurred between the spouses (\"gone in unto each other\") and the fact that the marriage itself is a \"solemn covenant\" taken in the name of Allah. The commentary explains that \"gone in unto each other\" is not limited to physical intimacy but encompasses the deep emotional connection, shared life, secrets, and mutual support within a marriage. Marriage is presented not merely as a contract, but as a sacred promise and a bond of trust established under Allah's sanction. Breaking this solemn covenant by unfairly reclaiming the dowry, especially after having shared such a deep relationship, is portrayed as highly dishonorable.","arabic":"وَلَا تَنْكِحُوا مَا نَكَحَ آبَاؤُكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَمَقْتًا وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"22","text":"Prohibited to you (For marriage) are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, Mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;-","commentary":"This verse introduces a new set of regulations concerning marriage prohibitions, starting with a strong prohibition against marrying a woman whom one's father had previously married (stepmothers). This was a practice that existed in pre-Islamic times, sometimes involving inheritance of the stepmother or barring her from remarrying. Islam strictly forbids this practice, describing it in the strongest terms as \"shameful and odious\" and an \"abominable custom.\" The prohibition aims to protect the dignity of the father-son relationship and the sanctity of family bonds. An exception is made for such marriages that may have occurred before the advent of Islam, indicating that past actions are not held against individuals once they embrace the new laws. This prohibition serves as a foundation for the more detailed list of forbidden marriages that follows.","arabic":"حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أُمَّهَاتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُكُمْ وَأَخَوَاتُكُمْ وَعَمَّاتُكُمْ وَخَالَاتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُ الْأَخِ وَبَنَاتُ الْأُخْتِ وَأُمَّهَاتُكُمُ اللَّاتِي أَرْضَعْنَكُمْ وَأَخَوَاتُكُمْ مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ وَأُمَّهَاتُ نِسَائِكُمْ وَرَبَائِبُكُمُ اللَّاتِي فِي حُجُورِكُمْ مِنْ نِسَائِكُمُ اللَّاتِي دَخَلْتُمْ بِهِنَّ فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُونُوا دَخَلْتُمْ بِهِنَّ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَحَلَائِلُ أَبْنَائِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَابِكُمْ وَأَنْ تَجْمَعُوا بَيْنَ الْأُخْتَيْنِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"23","text":"Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.","commentary":"Following the general prohibition in the previous verse, this verse provides a detailed list of women whom a man is permanently forbidden to marry due to close relationship. These prohibited relationships are based on three categories: blood relation (lineage), relation through breastfeeding (suckling), and relations established through marriage. The list includes mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal and maternal aunts, nieces (daughters of brothers and sisters), foster-mothers (women who breastfed a child), foster-sisters, mothers-in-law, stepdaughters (under specific conditions), and the wives of one's biological sons. It also includes a temporary prohibition: marrying two sisters at the same time. The commentary explains that this list is part of Islam's comprehensive system for organizing family life and maintaining social purity, establishing clear boundaries for marriage relationships based on these close ties. It concludes by noting Allah's forgiveness and mercy, particularly regarding past practices before these laws were established.","arabic":"وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ ۖ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ مَا وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَنْ تَبْتَغُوا بِأَمْوَالِكُمْ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ ۚ فَمَا اسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً ۚ وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَاضَيْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ الْفَرِيضَةِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"24","text":"If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: And Allah hath full knowledge about your faith.

This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practise self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse concludes the list of prohibited women by stating that already married women are also forbidden, reinforcing the structure of marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prohibiting adultery and polyandry. An exception mentioned here refers to women who became captives of war in a historical context where such practices were prevalent internationally. The verse then declares that all women *not* on the prohibited lists are lawful for marriage. However, it strictly outlines the conditions for such lawful relationships: they must be sought through marriage (not illicit encounters), involve the giving of a dowry to the woman from the man's property as a required gift, and the intention must be to establish a bond of chastity and mutual commitment, not merely to satisfy desire. The dowry is the woman's right, though the couple may mutually agree to adjust the amount after it has been set. The verse emphasizes that these are divine ordinances from Allah, binding upon believers, and that these laws are based on Allah's perfect knowledge and wisdom, designed to guide humanity towards pure and beneficial relationships. It distinguishes sharply between lawful marriage, which builds families and societies, and all forms of illicit sexual relationships, which are forbidden.","arabic":"وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنْكُمْ طَوْلًا أَنْ يَنْكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ فَمِنْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ مِنْ فَتَيَاتِكُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَانِكُمْ ۚ بَعْضُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْضٍ ۚ فَانْكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذْنِ أَهْلِهِنَّ وَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ مُحْصَنَاتٍ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحَاتٍ وَلَا مُتَّخِذَاتِ أَخْدَانٍ ۚ فَإِذَا أُحْصِنَّ فَإِنْ أَتَيْنَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ فَعَلَيْهِنَّ نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى الْمُحْصَنَاتِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ الْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ ۚ وَأَنْ تَصْبِرُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"25","text":"Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion on marriage regulations, offering guidance for those who may not have the means to marry free believing women. It permits marrying believing women who were captives of war (referred to as \"those whom your right hands possess\"), provided they are believers. This permission comes from Allah, who knows your faith. The verse emphasizes that all believers are connected, highlighting a shared humanity and faith. It requires that marriage to such women be done with the permission of their guardians or owners, and that their dowry (a payment from the husband to the wife) be given equitably. The verse stresses that these marriages must be for the purpose of establishing a chaste union, not for casual or illicit relationships. It addresses a specific legal point for that time: if a married woman from this group commits a serious immoral act, her prescribed punishment is half that of a free married woman. This distinction acknowledges the differing social circumstances but still requires accountability. This permission to marry a believing woman from this group is presented as a concession for those who fear falling into sinful behavior due to lack of means to marry a free woman. However, the verse adds that exercising patience and self-restraint is preferable if possible. The verse concludes by reminding us that Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, indicating that these laws are given with consideration for human weakness and the availability of divine mercy. This connects to the broader theme of providing clear guidance for society's well-being while acknowledging human limitations.","arabic":"يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ سُنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ وَيَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Allah doth wish to Turn to you, but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that ye should turn away (from Him),- far, far away.","commentary":"Following the detailed legislation about marriage and relationships, this verse explains Allah's purpose behind revealing such laws. Allah wishes to make things clear for people and guide them by showing them the righteous ways of those who lived before them. This suggests that the principles of upright living and righteous conduct are consistent across divine messages throughout history. By revealing these ordinances, Allah also wishes to extend His mercy to people, guiding them away from harmful practices and towards a life that is pleasing to Him and beneficial for them. The verse ends by stating that Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise, reinforcing that these laws and guidance are based on perfect knowledge of human nature and needs, and are enacted with ultimate wisdom. This verse serves as an overarching statement about the nature of the divine laws being revealed, linking the specific regulations (like those in the preceding verses on marriage and social conduct) to Allah's universal wisdom, knowledge, and mercy.","arabic":"وَاللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الشَّهَوَاتِ أَنْ تَمِيلُوا مَيْلًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"27","text":"Allah doth wish to lighten your (difficulties): For man was created Weak (in flesh).","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's theme of Allah's wish to turn to people in mercy and guide them, this verse presents a contrasting desire. It highlights that while Allah wants people to follow His guidance and benefit from His mercy, there are others – those who prioritize their desires and ignore divine direction – who wish for people to stray far from Allah's path. This contrast underscores the fundamental choice people face: aligning themselves with Allah's will, which leads to clarity and mercy, or following fleeting desires, which leads to deviation and spiritual distance. This verse emphasizes the importance of adhering to the guidance provided (like the regulations in the preceding verses on marriage and conduct) as a way to stay close to Allah and resist the pull of unrestrained desires that lead one astray.","arabic":"يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ أَنْ يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ ۚ وَخُلِقَ الْإِنْسَانُ ضَعِيفًا"},{"verse":"28","text":"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!","commentary":"This verse provides a final explanation for the nature of the divine laws and guidance discussed. It states that Allah intends to make things easier for people and lighten their burdens. This is presented as a consequence of human nature: humans were created with inherent weaknesses. This doesn't mean Allah's laws are lax, but rather that they are practical and achievable, designed to guide people towards good without placing an unbearable strain on them. The regulations regarding marriage, relationships, and moral conduct, as outlined in the preceding verses, are part of this effort to lighten burdens by providing clear, healthy, and fulfilling ways to live, thereby protecting individuals and society from the chaotic and destructive consequences of unchecked desires or unrealistic expectations. This verse offers comfort and reassurance, confirming that Allah's path is intended to be one of ease and mercy, suited to the human condition, in contrast to the hardship and straying mentioned in the previous verse that results from abandoning divine guidance.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْكُمْ ۚ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"29","text":"If any do that in rancour and injustice,- soon shall We cast them into the Fire: And easy it is for Allah.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who believe, reminding them of their faith before outlining important principles regarding property and wealth. It prohibits people from taking one another's property unjustly or through dishonest means. The verse makes it clear that the only lawful way to acquire wealth from others is through trade and business conducted with mutual consent. Taking property through illegal methods is likened to destroying oneself or one's community, because such actions are harmful and destructive to society. Allah forbids these practices out of His great mercy for humanity, guiding believers towards just and beneficial ways of dealing with one another. This prohibition sets the stage for further details about financial matters and the consequences of violating these rules, as discussed in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا ۚ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا"},{"verse":"30","text":"If ye (but) eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden to do, We shall expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a gate of great honour.","commentary":"Building on the prohibition in the previous verse against taking property unjustly, this verse issues a stern warning about the consequences for those who persist in such actions deliberately and with ill intention. It states that if individuals engage in these forbidden financial practices out of malice and wrongdoing, they will face punishment in the afterlife, specifically being cast into the Fire. This emphasizes the seriousness of violating Allah's commands regarding justice in financial dealings. The verse concludes by stating that this punishment is easy for Allah, highlighting His absolute power and the inevitability of His decree for those who act unjustly. This serves as a strong deterrent and precedes a verse that offers hope through avoiding major sins.","arabic":"إِنْ تَجْتَنِبُوا كَبَائِرَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُدْخَلًا كَرِيمًا"},{"verse":"31","text":"And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts More freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn, and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath full knowledge of all things.","commentary":"Following the warning of punishment for intentional wrongdoing in the previous verse, this verse offers a message of hope and Allah's vast mercy. It reassures believers that if they strive to avoid the most serious and major sins that Allah has forbidden, He will forgive their lesser mistakes and allow them to enter paradise, described here as an \"abode of glory\" or \"a gate of great honour\". This highlights the merciful nature of Islam, which acknowledges human weakness but encourages striving to avoid the gravest wrongs. By focusing on avoiding major sins, believers are given a clear path to seeking Allah's forgiveness and attaining His pleasure, providing comfort after the strong warning in Verse 30 and transitioning to a discussion about different kinds of divine blessings.","arabic":"وَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْا مَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۚ لِلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا اكْتَسَبُوا ۖ وَلِلنِّسَاءِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا اكْتَسَبْنَ ۚ وَاسْأَلُوا اللَّهَ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"32","text":"To (benefit) every one, We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion. For truly Allah is witness to all things.","commentary":"Moving from the topic of avoiding major sins and seeking forgiveness, this verse addresses human desires and the distribution of Allah's blessings. It advises against coveting or envying the specific favors, wealth, or abilities that Allah has bestowed more generously on some people than others. Instead of focusing on what others have, the verse encourages individuals to work for what they can earn – clearly stating that both men and women have the right to benefit from their own earnings. It then directs people to ask Allah directly for His bounty and grace, emphasizing that His resources are limitless and He knows what is best for everyone. This verse is foundational in establishing the equal right of men and women to earn and own property, a point that leads into the next verse concerning how wealth is distributed through inheritance.","arabic":"وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالْأَقْرَبُونَ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَآتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"33","text":"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means.

It explains that Allah has ordained a system of inheritance, assigning specific shares of property left by parents and relatives to designated heirs. This ensures that wealth circulates within families and across generations according to a divine pattern, rather than being concentrated or left to arbitrary distribution. The verse also addresses historical social contracts or pledges of loyalty that existed, some of which had implications for inheritance or mutual financial responsibility. It directs believers to fulfill their obligations to those with whom they had such existing, valid covenants, even as the primary system of inheritance became based on kinship. By stating that \"Allah is witness to all things,\" the verse underscores the importance of upholding these financial obligations and the fact that Allah is fully aware of all transactions and agreements, serving as a transition to the next topic concerning roles within the family, which are also ordained by Allah.","arabic":"الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنْفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ ۚ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ۖ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"34","text":"If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things.","commentary":"Following the discussions on financial dealings and inheritance, this verse moves to the structure and dynamics within the family unit, which is fundamental in Islam. It describes the role of men as the protectors and maintainers of women. This is based on two reasons: the natural differences Allah has created between them, which suit men for the responsibility of providing and protecting, and the man's duty to support the family financially from his own wealth. The verse then describes the qualities of righteous women as being devout and guarding the sanctity of the marriage relationship and family honor, including in the husband's absence, as Allah has instructed.\n\nThe verse then addresses how to handle serious marital disharmony or disloyalty from the wife's side. It outlines a progressive approach for the husband to take within the home: first, gently advising and admonishing her; second, if that is ineffective, separating beds as a form of expressing displeasure; and third, as a last resort in certain difficult situations where other measures fail, a light, non-injurious physical correction. It is crucial to understand that Islamic teachings and the Prophet's example stress that any physical correction must be light, without causing pain or injury, and is intended as a symbolic measure to highlight the seriousness of the situation, not as punishment or abuse. The aim of these steps is reconciliation and preserving the family unit. The verse concludes by stating that if the wife changes her behavior and seeks harmony, the husband must not seek further reasons to cause her difficulty or harm. This section ends with a reminder that Allah is Most High and Great, placing human actions and authority within the context of His ultimate authority and justice. If these steps do not resolve the conflict, the next verse provides a further measure.","arabic":"وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَابْعَثُوا حَكَمًا مِنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَمًا مِنْ أَهْلِهَا إِنْ يُرِيدَا إِصْلَاحًا يُوَفِّقِ اللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا خَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"35","text":"Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are near, neighbours who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious;-","commentary":"This verse provides the next step when marital difficulties persist despite the measures outlined in Verse 34, or when a serious breakdown in the relationship (a breach) is feared. It directs the families of the husband and wife to get involved by appointing two arbiters – one from his side and one from hers. The purpose of these arbiters is to mediate and attempt to resolve the conflict between the couple. The verse emphasizes that if both the husband and wife, and the arbiters, sincerely desire reconciliation and work towards peace, Allah will help to bring them back together. This highlights the importance Islam places on preserving the marriage and involves the extended families in the process. The verse concludes by reaffirming that Allah has full knowledge of all things, including the intentions and efforts of the individuals involved, and is aware of what is best for them. This serves as a reminder that ultimately, the outcome is in Allah's hands, based on human efforts and sincerity.\n\n---","arabic":"وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَبِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَالْجَارِ ذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْجَارِ الْجُنُبِ وَالصَّاحِبِ بِالْجَنْبِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَنْ كَانَ مُخْتَالًا فَخُورًا"},{"verse":"36","text":"(Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide the bounties which Allah hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those who resist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt;-","commentary":"This verse begins by stating the most fundamental principle in Islam: worshipping only Allah and associating nothing else with Him. It then immediately follows with a comprehensive list of people to whom kindness and good treatment are due. This shows how direct devotion to Allah is intrinsically linked with righteous conduct towards others. The verse calls for kindness towards parents, relatives, orphans, those in need, different types of neighbors, companions, travelers, and those under one's care. This broad scope emphasizes the importance of social responsibility and compassion as part of one's faith. The verse concludes by warning against arrogance and boastfulness, qualities that are incompatible with sincere worship of Allah and genuine kindness to His creation. This ending sets the stage for the verses that follow, which describe the negative traits and consequences associated with a lack of faith and kindness.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَا آتَاهُمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۗ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُهِينًا"},{"verse":"37","text":"Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate, what a dreadful intimate he is!","commentary":"Continuing the thought from the end of the previous verse, this verse describes another negative trait: miserliness. It condemns those who are stingy, encourage others to be stingy, or conceal the blessings Allah has given them. This is contrasted with the spirit of generosity and sharing encouraged in the previous verse as a consequence of worshipping Allah alone. The verse explicitly links these behaviors to a rejection of faith, stating that Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for those who resist faith. This connection highlights that withholding kindness and failing to acknowledge Allah's blessings are seen as stemming from a deeper issue of not believing in and relying on Allah.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ رِئَاءَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلَا بِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكُنِ الشَّيْطَانُ لَهُ قَرِينًا فَسَاءَ قَرِينًا"},{"verse":"38","text":"And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in Allah and in the Last Day, and they spent out of what Allah hath given them for sustenance? For Allah hath full knowledge of them.","commentary":"Building on the condemnation of negative traits in the previous verses, this verse points out yet another undesirable behavior: spending wealth for the sake of showing off, without genuine faith in Allah and the Hereafter. While the previous verse criticized miserliness, this verse addresses spending done with the wrong intention, motivated by seeking human praise rather than seeking Allah's pleasure. It emphasizes that true generosity must be rooted in faith. The verse concludes with a stark warning that those who lack this faith and spend merely for show are essentially taking the Evil One (Satan) as their close companion, highlighting the corrupt nature of their motivation. This reinforces the idea introduced in the previous verses that actions are judged by their underlying belief and intention.","arabic":"وَمَاذَا عَلَيْهِمْ لَوْ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَأَنْفَقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِهِمْ عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"39","text":"Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward.","commentary":"This verse poses a rhetorical question, directly addressing those described in the preceding verses (37-38) who are miserly or spend for show due to their lack of faith. It asks what harm or burden it would be for them if they simply believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent from the provisions Allah has granted them. This highlights the ease and benefit of sincere faith and generosity, contrasting it with the spiritual burden of their current state. The verse concludes by stating that Allah has full knowledge of them, implying that He is aware of their intentions and actions, whether good or bad, and will judge accordingly. This sets the stage for the following verse, which assures that good deeds rooted in faith are fully known and rewarded by Allah.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ ۖ وَإِنْ تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَاعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِنْ لَدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"40","text":"How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as a witness against these people!","commentary":"Following the affirmation of Allah's knowledge in the previous verse (V39), this verse provides further assurance regarding His absolute justice and immense generosity. It declares that Allah is never unjust, not even by the slightest amount. This is a powerful statement guaranteeing fairness in divine judgment. It then emphasizes that when a good deed is done, Allah not only credits it fully but multiplies its reward and bestows an even greater reward out of His own grace. This reinforces the encouragement for faith and spending mentioned in the preceding verses (V39), illustrating the tremendous benefit of doing good deeds with sincere belief in Allah.","arabic":"فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِنْ كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"41","text":"On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah!","commentary":"This verse transitions from describing Allah's justice and reward in this life and the Hereafter to depicting a scene from the Day of Judgment. It poses a powerful question about the state of those who rejected faith, asking what their condition will be when Allah brings a witness from every nation to testify about their actions, and specifically brings Prophet Muhammad as a witness against his own people. This vivid imagery serves as a solemn reminder of accountability and the seriousness of rejecting the message brought by Allah's Messenger. This verse leads directly into the next, describing the reaction and ultimate fate of those who are found wanting on that day.","arabic":"يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَعَصَوُا الرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ الْأَرْضُ وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا"},{"verse":"42","text":"O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again.","commentary":"Continuing the scene from the previous verse (V41) set on the Day of Judgment, this verse describes the intense regret of those who rejected faith and disobeyed the Messenger. Faced with the consequences of their actions and witnessing the testimony against them, their shame and despair will be so profound that they will wish the earth would swallow them up. However, the verse emphasizes the futility of this wish and any attempt to conceal their past, stating that they will never be able to hide anything from Allah. This highlights Allah's complete and perfect knowledge, leaving no room for denial or escape from accountability.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْرَبُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَأَنْتُمْ سُكَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَعْلَمُوا مَا تَقُولُونَ وَلَا جُنُبًا إِلَّا عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ حَتَّىٰ تَغْتَسِلُوا ۚ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ مَرْضَىٰ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاءَ أَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنَ الْغَائِطِ أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُوا مَاءً فَتَيَمَّمُوا صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَامْسَحُوا بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا"},{"verse":"43","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they traffic in error, and wish that ye should lose the right path.","commentary":"Moving from the themes of faith, conduct, and accountability in the Hereafter, this verse addresses the believers with practical instructions regarding prayer, which is the central act of worship in Islam. It first advises against praying when one's mind is unclear (such as being intoxicated) until they can fully understand what they are saying. This emphasizes the importance of consciousness and presence of mind during prayer, which is a communion with Allah. Secondly, it instructs believers not to approach prayer in a state of ceremonial impurity, which requires a full ritual bath, with a specific exception mentioned for travelers (referring to specific circumstances or passage through a mosque).\n\nThe verse then provides alternatives for maintaining ritual purity when water is unavailable or harmful. It explains that if one is ill, traveling, has relieved themselves, or has had physical contact requiring ritual washing, and cannot find water, they may perform a \"dry ablution\" using pure earth or sand, lightly wiping their face and hands. This demonstrates the flexibility and ease Allah provides in religious obligations, ensuring that prayer remains possible even in difficult circumstances. The verse concludes by stating that Allah is Most Lenient and Much-Forgiving, reinforcing the message that these provisions are a sign of His mercy and forgiveness towards His servants.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِنَ الْكِتَابِ يَشْتَرُونَ الضَّلَالَةَ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَضِلُّوا السَّبِيلَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for a protector, and Allah is enough for a Helper.","commentary":"This verse begins by drawing attention to a group who had received divine scripture in the past. Despite having this guidance, they are described as trading it away for error and actively wanting others, specifically the believers, to lose their way. This highlights a contrast: they possessed guidance but chose to abandon it, and then sought to lead others astray from the path of truth. This sets the stage for discussing the attitudes and actions of this group described in the following verses.","arabic":"وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِأَعْدَائِكُمْ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"45","text":"Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: \"We hear and we disobey\"; and \"Hear what is not Heard\"; and \"Ra'ina\"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: \"What hear and we obey\"; and \"Do hear\"; and \"Do look at us\"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.","commentary":"Following the mention in the previous verse of those who trade in error and wish for believers to deviate, this verse provides reassurance. It informs the believers that Allah is fully aware of those who oppose them. It then emphasizes that Allah's protection and help are entirely sufficient for the believers, providing a strong sense of security against any schemes or hostilities mentioned.","arabic":"مِنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُوا يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَنْ مَوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَاسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَاعِنَا لَيًّا بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْنًا فِي الدِّينِ ۚ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَاسْمَعْ وَانْظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَٰكِنْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"46","text":"O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have (now) revealed, confirming what was (already) with you, before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers, for the decision of Allah Must be carried out.","commentary":"This verse describes specific behaviors attributed to some individuals among the Jewish community at the time. It notes that they would subtly alter the meaning of scriptures or use ambiguous language when speaking to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), often with underlying disrespect or defiance. For example, they might twist common phrases or reply in ways that, while seemingly polite, carried negative or disobedient meanings. The verse contrasts this with the straightforward and respectful attitude they should have adopted, stating that such honest behavior would have been better for them. Their rejection of truth and hostile actions are given as the reason for Allah's rejection of them (or \"cursing\" them), and it notes that only a few from this group ultimately accepted the new message. This continues the theme from Verse 44 about deviation from guidance.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ آمِنُوا بِمَا نَزَّلْنَا مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ نَطْمِسَ وُجُوهًا فَنَرُدَّهَا عَلَىٰ أَدْبَارِهَا أَوْ نَلْعَنَهُمْ كَمَا لَعَنَّا أَصْحَابَ السَّبْتِ ۚ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ مَفْعُولًا"},{"verse":"47","text":"Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed.","commentary":"This verse issues a direct call to the \"People of the Book,\" referring primarily to the Jewish community at the time, urging them to believe in the Qur'an that Allah has revealed. It highlights that this new revelation confirms the truth of the scriptures they already possess. The call is coupled with a stern warning: believe before consequences occur, described here as potentially losing their distinct identity or true guidance, perhaps in a way similar to the people who were previously punished for breaking the Sabbath law (mentioned in other scriptures and the Qur'an). The verse emphasizes that Allah's decree is certain to be carried out. This call to believe directly follows the description in Verse 46 of some individuals from the Jewish community displaying disrespect and deviation.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَنْ يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَىٰ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"48","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves? Nay-but Allah Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing.","commentary":"This verse introduces a fundamental concept in Islam: the absolute oneness of Allah. It declares that associating any partners with Allah (claiming divinity for anyone/anything other than Allah, or giving others rights only due to Allah, like the ultimate right to legislate) is a sin that Allah does not forgive if a person dies in that state without repenting. However, it immediately emphasizes the vastness of Allah's mercy by stating that He can forgive any other sin for whomever He wills. Associating partners with Allah is described as the most serious of sins. This principle is mentioned here possibly because the group discussed in the preceding verses, despite having scripture, had deviated into forms of associating partners with Allah by giving undue authority to religious figures or making claims that contradicted pure monotheism, which is the core message reinforced by the Qur'an.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ بَلِ اللَّهُ يُزَكِّي مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا"},{"verse":"49","text":"Behold! how they invent a lie against Allah! but that by itself is a manifest sin!","commentary":"The focus shifts to those who may claim a special status or purity for themselves, perhaps implying closeness to Allah or being favored, regardless of their actions. The verse challenges this notion, stating that it is Allah alone who purifies or bestows favor upon whom He wills. It implies that such claims made by people for themselves are unfounded. It also assures that no one will be wronged, emphasizing that true status is based on what Allah knows and bestows, not on self-declaration. This follows the discussion of deviation and the unforgivable sin of associating partners with Allah, suggesting that claims of purity or favor are hollow if not based on true faith and righteous conduct as judged by Allah.","arabic":"انْظُرْ كَيْفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ ۖ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِ إِثْمًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"50","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they believe in sorcery and Evil, and say to the Unbelievers that they are better guided in the (right) way Than the believers!","commentary":"This verse directly follows the previous one and identifies the act of claiming self-sanctity (in the context described in Verse 49, i.e., claiming special status or favor from Allah when one's actions or beliefs contradict divine guidance) as fabricating a lie against Allah. It sternly states that this act alone is a clear and undeniable sin. This reinforces the rejection of self-appointed claims of religious status or purity when such claims are not aligned with divine truth and are, in essence, false assertions about Allah's favor.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِنَ الْكِتَابِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّاغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"51","text":"They are (men) whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah Hath cursed, thou wilt find, have no one to help.","commentary":"Returning to the theme of the group who received earlier scriptures, this verse points out a surprising contradiction: despite having received divine guidance, some among them are described as believing in falsehood or influences that lead away from truth. Furthermore, they are reported to have claimed to those who did not believe in Allah (the \"unbelievers\" or idolaters) that they were better guided than the believers (the followers of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him). This is presented as a startling deviation, where those who had scripture appeared to align themselves with those who had none, against those who followed the new divine message. This highlights a deep level of opposition and misguided judgment.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ وَمَنْ يَلْعَنِ اللَّهُ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُ نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"52","text":"Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing to their fellow-men?","commentary":"This verse states the consequence for the actions and attitudes described in the previous verse (Verse 51) – supporting falsehood and claiming unbelievers are better guided than believers. It declares that these are people whom Allah has rejected (or \"cursed\"). It then makes a definitive statement that anyone rejected by Allah will find no one to help them. This emphasizes the ultimate consequence of opposing divine guidance and aligning with those who reject truth, underscoring that true support comes only from Allah.","arabic":"أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذًا لَا يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيرًا"},{"verse":"53","text":"Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty? but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.","commentary":"Following the declaration in Verse 52 that those rejected by Allah have no helper, this verse poses a rhetorical question challenging any perceived authority or entitlement of the group previously discussed. It questions if they hold any share in Allah's dominion or power that would justify their attitude or claims. It then contrasts this by pointing out their stinginess, even to the degree of not giving the slightest amount (symbolized by the tiny groove in a date-stone) to others. This illustrates a character trait – lack of generosity and perhaps envy or possessiveness – that further undermines any claim to high status or authority and connects to the reasons why they might oppose others receiving Allah's bounty. This serves to highlight their limited nature and lack of true authority compared to the boundless grace of Allah.","arabic":"أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ عَلَىٰ مَا آتَاهُمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۖ فَقَدْ آتَيْنَا آلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَآتَيْنَاهُمْ مُلْكًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"54","text":"Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire.","commentary":"This verse questions the attitude of some people, particularly referencing a group among the Jews at that time, asking if they are driven by envy towards others (specifically, Prophet Muhammad and his followers) because of the blessings Allah has bestowed upon them. Allah gave the Muslims guidance, prophecy, and strength. The verse points out that this envy is unfounded, because Allah had previously given the descendants of Prophet Abraham (which includes the Israelites) great blessings, including divine scriptures (the Book), wisdom, and even a significant kingdom. It highlights the inconsistency of envying others for receiving Allah's bounty when their own ancestors were also recipients of immense favor from Allah.","arabic":"فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ آمَنَ بِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ صَدَّ عَنْهُ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِجَهَنَّمَ سَعِيرًا"},{"verse":"55","text":"Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse which mentioned the blessings given to Prophet Abraham's descendants, this verse explains that despite receiving the Book, wisdom, and a kingdom, this group was divided in their response to the prophets sent to them (including, by extension, Prophet Muhammad). Some believed in the messengers and the guidance they brought, while many others turned away and rejected it. As a consequence for this rejection and turning away from Allah's signs, the verse sternly warns that Hellfire is a sufficient and severe punishment. This shows that receiving blessings in the past does not guarantee salvation; belief and acceptance of Allah's guidance are necessary.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"56","text":"But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit to Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades, cool and ever deepening.","commentary":"Following the mention of Hell as the consequence for those who turn away, this verse describes the severe punishment awaiting those who deliberately reject Allah's signs, which include the divine revelations and the prophets sent with them. It paints a vivid picture of the intensity of the suffering in the Fire, explaining that their skins will be renewed repeatedly after being burned. This continuous renewal is so that they constantly experience the pain and fully taste the penalty for their rejection. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's absolute power to carry out this punishment and His perfect wisdom in decreeing it as a just consequence for disbelief.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۖ لَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ ۖ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"57","text":"Allah doth command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For Allah is He Who heareth and seeth all things.","commentary":"In stark contrast to the severe punishment described in the previous verse for those who reject faith, this verse describes the beautiful reward for those who embrace belief and act righteously. It promises that they will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, where rivers flow, signifying abundance and tranquility. This will be their eternal dwelling place, emphasizing the lasting nature of the bliss. The verse also mentions the presence of pure and holy companions and describes the peaceful, cool, and deep shade they will enjoy, adding to the feeling of comfort, ease, and perfect happiness in Paradise. This verse highlights the opposing destinies based on one's response to Allah's guidance: severe punishment for rejection and immense, eternal reward for belief and good deeds.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تُؤَدُّوا الْأَمَانَاتِ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ أَنْ تَحْكُمُوا بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"58","text":"O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination.","commentary":"This verse begins by outlining two fundamental commands from Allah: upholding trusts and administering justice. The concept of \"trusts\" is broad, starting with the primary trust within human nature to recognize and believe in Allah, and extending to all forms of responsibility, such as honesty in dealings, caring for others, and contributing to the welfare of the community. The command for justice is equally universal, emphasizing that fairness is required in all dealings between people, regardless of their background or beliefs. These commands are presented as excellent guidance from Allah, reinforced by the reminder that Allah hears and sees everything, encouraging individuals to be mindful of their actions in all circumstances. This verse sets a foundation for the practical application of faith, linking inner belief to outward behavior in society.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا"},{"verse":"59","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the Evil One, though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right).","commentary":"Building on the foundational principles of trust and justice from the previous verse, this verse specifies the source of authority and guidance for believers. It commands obedience first to Allah, then to the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad), and then to those in authority who are from among the believers and uphold Allah's commands. Obedience to the Messenger is presented as part of obedience to Allah, as he conveyed Allah's message and guidance. The verse establishes a clear hierarchy and a method for resolving disagreements: any disputes should be referred back to Allah and His Messenger, which means seeking resolution in the teachings of the Qur'an and the Prophet's practice (Sunnah). This process is stated as a condition of true belief in Allah and the Last Day, and is described as the best and most appropriate way to reach a correct decision, ensuring that guidance ultimately comes from the Divine source.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوا أَنْ يَكْفُرُوا بِهِ وَيُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَنْ يُضِلَّهُمْ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا"},{"verse":"60","text":"When it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah hath revealed, and to the Messenger\": Thou seest the Hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust.","commentary":"This verse contrasts with the previous one by highlighting the contradictory behavior of some who claim to believe but choose not to follow the divine guidance offered through Allah and His Messenger. It describes people who profess belief in the revelations sent to Prophet Muhammad and earlier prophets, yet when faced with disputes, they prefer to seek judgment from sources other than Allah's law. The verse refers to these alternative sources metaphorically as \"the Evil One\" or \"false gods,\" implying systems or authorities that are not based on divine revelation and deviate from the path Allah has commanded. Despite being instructed to reject such systems, their inclination towards them is seen as a sign of being led astray by negative influences, specifically referred to as Satan's desire to distance them from the truth.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ وَإِلَى الرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ الْمُنَافِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنْكَ صُدُودًا"},{"verse":"61","text":"How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth? Then their come to thee, swearing by Allah: \"We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!\"","commentary":"This verse continues the theme from the previous one (verse 60), illustrating the reaction of those whose claims of belief are not sincere. It describes how when these individuals, identified here as hypocrites, are invited to resolve their issues by turning to the divine revelation (the Qur'an) and the guidance of the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad), they visibly turn away with aversion and dislike. This reluctance to seek judgment from the very source they claim to believe in exposes the insincerity of their faith and highlights the disconnect between their words and actions. Their aversion is presented as a clear sign of hypocrisy, demonstrating their real preference for sources of authority other than Allah and His Messenger.","arabic":"فَكَيْفَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ جَاءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَا إِلَّا إِحْسَانًا وَتَوْفِيقًا"},{"verse":"62","text":"Those men,-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, but admonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls.","commentary":"Following the description of the hypocrites' aversion in verse 61, this verse questions their reaction when the consequences of their actions (perhaps choosing non-divine judgment or showing insincerity) lead to misfortune or difficulty. It depicts them coming to the Messenger after facing hardship, desperately trying to justify their past behavior. They even swear by Allah, claiming that their true intention was not to reject divine guidance but merely to achieve harmony and reconciliation among people. This highlights the pattern of insincere excuses offered when their flawed approach, which deviates from Allah's commands, results in negative outcomes, further exposing the gap between their outward claims and inner reality.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُلْ لَهُمْ فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًا بَلِيغًا"},{"verse":"63","text":"We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of Allah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful.","commentary":"In response to the hypocrites' excuses mentioned in verse 62, this verse offers guidance on how to deal with such individuals. It reassures the Messenger (and by extension, believers) that Allah is fully aware of the true state of their hearts and their hidden intentions, despite their outward claims and oaths. While recognizing their insincerity, the instruction is not to confront them harshly about their hypocrisy but to distance oneself from their behavior (\"keep clear of them\") while continuing to offer sincere advice and admonition. The phrase \"speak to them a word to reach their very souls\" emphasizes the importance of delivering the message effectively, aiming to penetrate their inner selves with truth and wisdom, encouraging genuine change rather than mere outward compliance.","arabic":"وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ رَسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"64","text":"But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the central role and authority of Allah's Messengers, connecting back to the command in verse 59 to obey the Messenger and contrasting with the behavior described in verses 60-62. It clarifies that the fundamental purpose of sending a Messenger is for him to be obeyed, as this obedience is in accordance with Allah's will and serves to establish the divine way of life. The verse then opens a door for those who \"wronged themselves\" (by disobeying or showing insincerity) to seek repentance. It assures them that if they had come to the Messenger, sought Allah's forgiveness directly, and the Messenger had also prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found Allah readily accepting of repentance and Most Merciful. This highlights the opportunity for reconciliation and forgiveness through turning back to Allah and seeking the Messenger's intercession.","arabic":"فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا"},{"verse":"65","text":"If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were (actually) told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthest to strengthen their (faith);","commentary":"Following the invitation to seek forgiveness in verse 64, this verse delivers a powerful and definitive statement about the conditions of true faith, emphasizing the point made earlier in verse 59 about referring disputes. Introduced with a strong oath by Allah, it unequivocally declares that individuals cannot be considered true believers until they accept the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) as the ultimate judge in all their disputes. More importantly, it adds that this acceptance must come without any hesitation or resistance in their hearts and souls. They must submit to his decisions with complete conviction and willing acceptance. This verse underscores that accepting and implementing Allah's law as conveyed by the Messenger is not just an outward act but requires inner peace, full satisfaction, and total submission, defining a core aspect of what it means to have sincere faith.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ اقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ أَوِ اخْرُجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ مَا فَعَلُوهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُوا مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتًا"},{"verse":"66","text":"And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward;","commentary":"This verse follows the declaration in verse 65 by highlighting the merciful and manageable nature of the commands that Allah has actually given. It suggests that if Allah had imposed extremely difficult duties, such as giving up one's life or leaving one's home, only a small number of people might be able or willing to fulfill them. However, the verse emphasizes that the commands Allah *has* given are within the capacity of most people. It asserts that if people sincerely follow these existing commands, it would be greatly beneficial for them in this life and the Hereafter, and would significantly strengthen their faith. This serves to encourage believers by showing that the path laid out for them is not an unbearable burden, but one designed for their well-being and spiritual growth.","arabic":"وَإِذًا لَآتَيْنَاهُمْ مِنْ لَدُنَّا أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"67","text":"And We should have shown them the Straight Way.","commentary":"This verse concludes the thought from the previous one (verse 66) by detailing the positive outcome of obeying Allah's commands, which are described as being within people's capacity. It promises that if believers follow the guidance and do what Allah has asked of them, they will receive a significant and great reward directly from Allah's presence. This serves as further encouragement, highlighting the immense divine generosity that awaits those who sincerely strive to live according to the principles outlined in these verses, reinforcing that obedience leads not only to spiritual strength but also to abundant blessings and favor from Allah.","arabic":"وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا"},{"verse":"68","text":"All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah,- of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!","commentary":"Following on from the previous verses which discuss the ease of the path set by Allah and what He asks of people, this verse assures that Allah would have guided them clearly to the right path. It implies that those who are willing to follow Allah's guidance, which is made accessible to them, would indeed be shown the 'Straight Way' to live their lives and connect with Him.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ ۚ وَحَسُنَ أُولَٰئِكَ رَفِيقًا"},{"verse":"69","text":"Such is the bounty from Allah: And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all.","commentary":"This verse describes the immense reward and honor for those who sincerely obey Allah and follow the guidance of His Messenger. It explains that by doing so, they will attain a high status and be in the company of the most esteemed individuals in the afterlife: the prophets sent by Allah, those who are absolutely truthful and sincere in their faith, those who bore witness to the truth (often interpreted as martyrs or those who testify to the truth of Allah's message), and the truly righteous people. The verse highlights this as a truly beautiful and desirable companionship. This follows the previous verses by describing the blessed outcome for those who are shown and follow the Straight Way.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ الْفَضْلُ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"70","text":"O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the message of the previous one (Verse 69). It explicitly states that the noble companionship and high status described as a reward for obedience are a generous gift or \"bounty\" from Allah, emphasizing that it is granted out of His grace. The verse concludes by stating that Allah's knowledge encompasses all things, which serves as an assurance that He is fully aware of everyone's deeds and intentions, and His promise of this bounty for the deserving is absolute and based on perfect knowledge.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا خُذُوا حِذْرَكُمْ فَانْفِرُوا ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ انْفِرُوا جَمِيعًا"},{"verse":"71","text":"There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: \"Allah did favour us in that we were not present among them.\"","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing the believers and giving them guidance related to facing potential danger. It advises them to be fully prepared and watchful against threats. It then gives a strategic instruction for times of conflict: the believers should advance either in small, separate groups or as one large, unified force. This advice is practical and highlights that the guidance in the Qur'an covers all aspects of life, including how a community should organize and protect itself when facing external threats. It prepares the believers for facing challenges as a unified body, whether segmented for tactical reasons or united as one.","arabic":"وَإِنَّ مِنْكُمْ لَمَنْ لَيُبَطِّئَنَّ فَإِنْ أَصَابَتْكُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ قَالَ قَدْ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيَّ إِذْ لَمْ أَكُنْ مَعَهُمْ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"72","text":"But if good fortune comes to you from Allah, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - \"Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!\"","commentary":"Following the call for preparedness and unity in the previous verse, this verse points out a different attitude found within the community. It describes some individuals who hold back or lag behind when it is time to go forth. Their reaction to misfortune or setback that happens to the believers who went forth is revealed: they express relief and feel favored by Allah because they avoided the difficulty. This highlights a focus on personal safety and avoiding hardship rather than commitment to the collective cause.","arabic":"وَلَئِنْ أَصَابَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُ مَوَدَّةٌ يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنْتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"73","text":"Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value).","commentary":"This verse continues describing the attitude of those who lagged behind, contrasting their reaction to misfortune (Verse 72) with their reaction to good fortune that comes to the believers from Allah. If the believers achieve success or gain advantage, these same individuals express regret that they weren't present, wishing they could have shared in the success. The verse notes that this reaction appears as though there was no real bond of affection or shared purpose between them and the believers who went forth. This reveals a self-centered motive, where their desire to participate is driven by the prospect of worldly gain rather than commitment to the cause or loyalty to their fellow believers. These verses (72-73) present a picture of individuals whose focus is primarily on immediate personal outcomes, whether avoiding loss or gaining benefit, rather than the higher objectives of the community's striving for the sake of Allah.","arabic":"فَلْيُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يَشْرُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَمَنْ يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَوْ يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"74","text":"And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)?- Men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!\"","commentary":"After highlighting the self-interested attitude of those who lag behind (Verses 72-73), this verse calls on those whose priority is the life after death to strive in Allah's cause. It presents this striving as an exchange: giving up the transient life of this world for the eternal reward of the hereafter. The verse promises a great reward from Allah to anyone who fights in His cause, emphasizing that this reward is assured regardless of the outcome – whether they are killed in the process or achieve victory. This serves as a powerful motivation, shifting the focus from immediate worldly concerns (like avoiding hardship or seeking temporary gain) to the immense value of Allah's pleasure and the eternal reward, thereby addressing the hesitant attitude described previously.","arabic":"وَمَا لَكُمْ لَا تُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ الْقَرْيَةِ الظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَاجْعَلْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ وَلِيًّا وَاجْعَلْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"75","text":"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.","commentary":"Building on the call to strive for Allah's cause in the previous verse (74), this verse provides a compelling reason and noble purpose for doing so. It asks rhetorically why believers would not fight to defend the oppressed and vulnerable – men, women, and children who are suffering injustice and calling out to Allah for rescue and help from those who are oppressing them. This clarifies that fighting in Islam is not for conquest or material gain, but fundamentally linked to defending the weak and establishing justice, especially when believers are persecuted for their faith and cannot defend themselves. It presents a clear, humanitarian dimension to striving for Allah's cause, appealing to the believers' sense of compassion and duty.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ الطَّاغُوتِ فَقَاتِلُوا أَوْلِيَاءَ الشَّيْطَانِ ۖ إِنَّ كَيْدَ الشَّيْطَانِ كَانَ ضَعِيفًا"},{"verse":"76","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: They said: \"Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term, near (enough)?\" Say: \"Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!","commentary":"This verse clearly distinguishes between two opposing sides in the conflict mentioned in the preceding verses. It states that believers strive for the cause of Allah, which means working to uphold divine principles, justice, and truth as revealed by Allah. In contrast, those who reject faith are described as striving for a cause aligned with negative influences and opposition to divine guidance. The verse refers to these influences collectively as \"Evil\" and the followers of such influences as \"friends of Satan,\" representing forces that oppose Allah's will. The believers are then encouraged to stand against these opposing forces, with the reassurance that the power and schemes of such opposition are ultimately weak. This verse frames the conflict as a fundamental struggle between divine guidance and forces that oppose it, emphasizing the strength of the believers' foundation in Allah's support compared to the inherent weakness of falsehood.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّوا أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً ۚ وَقَالُوا رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا الْقِتَالَ لَوْلَا أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ ۗ قُلْ مَتَاعُ الدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِمَنِ اتَّقَىٰ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا"},{"verse":"77","text":"\"Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!\" If some good befalls them, they say, \"This is from Allah\"; but if evil, they say, \"This is from thee\" (O Prophet). Say: \"All things are from Allah.\" But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact?","commentary":"Following the contrast between those who strive for Allah's cause and those who oppose it (Verse 76), this verse describes another attitude related to fighting. It refers to a group who, during an earlier period when they faced persecution, were instructed to refrain from fighting and focus on prayer and charity. However, when the time came later and the order to fight was given, some among them showed great fear of people (the enemy), a fear that was as strong as or even greater than their fear of Allah. Out of this fear, they questioned why fighting was now ordered and wished for a delay, preferring to live out their natural lifespan in peace. The verse directly addresses this fear and desire for worldly respite by stating that the enjoyment of this life is brief, while the hereafter is far better for those who live righteously, assuring them that they will face no injustice. This highlights a struggle within some individuals regarding commitment when faced with personal danger and contrasts their limited worldly perspective with the greater value of the eternal life and Allah's justice.","arabic":"أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُوا يُدْرِكْكُمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنْتُمْ فِي بُرُوجٍ مُشَيَّدَةٍ ۗ وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُوا هَٰذِهِ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُوا هَٰذِهِ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ ۚ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ ۖ فَمَالِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ الْقَوْمِ لَا يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثًا"},{"verse":"78","text":"Whatever good, (O man!) happens to thee, is from Allah; but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse (77) which addressed the fear of death and the desire for delay, this verse emphasizes the inescapable reality of death. It states that death will inevitably reach everyone regardless of where they are, even in the most fortified places. This is a direct counterpoint to the fear of fighting as a cause of death, impressing that the timing of death is determined by Allah, not by participation in conflict or efforts to avoid it. The verse then shifts to describe another flawed attitude held by some people: they attribute good outcomes to Allah but blame the Prophet for misfortunes. This reveals a misunderstanding of the relationship between cause and effect, divine will, and the Prophet's role. The response provided is a clear statement: \"All things are from Allah,\" emphasizing that both perceived good and evil ultimately occur by His will. The verse concludes by questioning the inability of such people to grasp this fundamental truth.","arabic":"مَا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِنْ نَفْسِكَ ۚ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"79","text":"He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah: But if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over their (evil deeds).","commentary":"Building on the statement in the previous verse (78) that \"All things are from Allah,\" this verse provides a further clarification regarding the source of good and evil experiences for human beings, focusing on personal responsibility. It explains that any good that comes to a person is from Allah, meaning it is a result of His grace, guidance, and the systems He has established. Conversely, any evil or misfortune that befalls a person is a consequence of their own actions, choices, and deviations from Allah's guidance. This reconciles the concept that everything is ultimately by Allah's will with the principle of human accountability. The verse then addresses the Prophet, confirming his role as a messenger sent to convey instructions to humanity, and affirms that Allah is a sufficient witness to this mission. This reinforces the authority of the message being delivered.","arabic":"مَنْ يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ ۖ وَمَنْ تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا"},{"verse":"80","text":"They have \"Obedience\" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.","commentary":"This verse further clarifies the relationship between Allah and the Messenger, directly following the affirmation of the Prophet's role as a messenger in the previous verse (79). It states a fundamental principle: obeying the Messenger is equivalent to obeying Allah Himself. This is because the Messenger conveys Allah's commands and guidance without alteration. Therefore, accepting and following the Messenger's directives is the practical way to submit to Allah. The verse then addresses those who turn away from the Messenger and his message. It reassures the Prophet that he is not sent as a \"keeper\" or overseer of their actions, implying his responsibility is to deliver the message clearly, not to force people to obey or to constantly monitor their wrongdoing. Their ultimate accountability is to Allah. This reinforces the concept of individual choice and responsibility in accepting or rejecting the divine message.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ فَإِذَا بَرَزُوا مِنْ عِنْدِكَ بَيَّتَ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ غَيْرَ الَّذِي تَقُولُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ ۖ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا"},{"verse":"81","text":"Do they not consider the Qur'an (with care)? Had it been from other Than Allah, they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy.","commentary":"This verse describes a group of people who verbally pledge their obedience to Prophet Muhammad when they are in his presence. However, when they are no longer with him, some among them secretly plan or discuss things contrary to what the Prophet has conveyed or instructed. It explains that Allah is fully aware of these secret plans and records them. The verse then instructs the Prophet (and by extension, the believers) to avoid engaging with them deeply regarding their hidden intentions, and instead, to place complete trust in Allah. It emphasizes that Allah is sufficient as someone to rely on and handle all affairs. This highlights the difference between outward appearance and inner reality for some people in the community at the time, and provides guidance on how to navigate such insincerity, connecting it to the importance of trusting Allah.","arabic":"أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا"},{"verse":"82","text":"When there comes to them some matter touching (Public) safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have Tested it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan.","commentary":"Following the description of those who were insincere or doubtful about the Prophet's message, this verse poses a question, urging reflection: Why don't they carefully contemplate the Qur'an? It presents a way for people to discern the divine origin of the Qur'an. It states that if the Qur'an had come from any source other than Allah, people would inevitably find many inconsistencies or contradictions within it. The absence of such discrepancies, despite its comprehensive nature and the varying circumstances and long period over which it was revealed, is presented as evidence that it is indeed from Allah, unlike human works which often show inconsistencies or changes in style or thought over time. This verse connects to the previous one by implicitly suggesting that sincere reflection on the Qur'an would resolve doubts or insincerity regarding its divine authority.","arabic":"وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ ۗ وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَاتَّبَعْتُمُ الشَّيْطَانَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"83","text":"Then fight in Allah's cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment.","commentary":"This verse addresses a behaviour seen in the community: when some people hear news or rumours concerning public safety or potential danger (like matters of war or peace), they spread it immediately without verification. This could cause confusion or disruption. The verse advises that the correct procedure would be to refer such information to Prophet Muhammad or to those in positions of authority among the believers. These leaders, who are skilled in understanding and assessing such matters, would be able to properly investigate and determine the truth and whether the information should be shared. The verse concludes by reminding the believers that were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah, many of them might have been led astray by harmful influences or negative consequences resulting from such indiscipline. This links back to the earlier discussion of insincerity and doubt, highlighting the importance of discipline, reliance on sound authority, and recognizing Allah's guidance as protection against negative influences.","arabic":"فَقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ لَا تُكَلَّفُ إِلَّا نَفْسَكَ ۚ وَحَرِّضِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَكُفَّ بَأْسَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ وَاللَّهُ أَشَدُّ بَأْسًا وَأَشَدُّ تَنْكِيلًا"},{"verse":"84","text":"Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And Allah hath power over all things.","commentary":"After addressing issues of doubt, insincerity, and lack of discipline within the community, this verse issues a direct command, primarily to Prophet Muhammad, to engage in fighting for the cause of Allah. It reassures the Prophet that he is responsible only for his own actions and obligations in this regard, even if others hesitate. He is also instructed to encourage the believers to join the effort. The verse offers hope and motivation by stating that Allah may curb the might of those who reject faith. It reinforces the message by emphasizing Allah's supreme strength and ability to punish. This serves as a powerful call to action, shifting the focus from internal issues to the external challenge, and emphasizing reliance on Allah's power for success.","arabic":"مَنْ يَشْفَعْ شَفَاعَةً حَسَنَةً يَكُنْ لَهُ نَصِيبٌ مِنْهَا ۖ وَمَنْ يَشْفَعْ شَفَاعَةً سَيِّئَةً يَكُنْ لَهُ كِفْلٌ مِنْهَا ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُقِيتًا"},{"verse":"85","text":"When a (courteous) greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or (at least) of equal courtesy.

It states that anyone who encourages, supports, or facilitates a good deed will receive a share of the reward associated with it. Conversely, anyone who promotes or aids an evil deed will share in the negative consequences or burden of that action. This principle is broad but is presented here in the context of encouraging fighting for Allah's cause (a good cause) versus discouraging it (potentially contributing to an evil outcome or burden). The verse concludes by affirming that Allah has power over all things, reinforcing His ability to account for and bring about the consequences of everyone's actions and influence.","arabic":"وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُمْ بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّوا بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَا أَوْ رُدُّوهَا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَسِيبًا"},{"verse":"86","text":"Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah's?","commentary":"This verse provides guidance on social interaction and manners, specifically regarding greetings. It instructs believers that when someone offers them a greeting, they should respond with a greeting that is even better or, at the very least, equal in courtesy. This encourages politeness and aims to foster positive relationships within the community. While seemingly distinct from the preceding verses about fighting and responsibility, it follows the general principle in Verse 85 about good deeds having good consequences, and promotes a specific good social practice. The verse concludes by reminding people that Allah keeps a careful account of all things, implying that even seemingly small acts of courtesy are known to Him and will be considered.","arabic":"اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۗ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا"},{"verse":"87","text":"Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way.","commentary":"This verse begins with a powerful declaration of the core belief in Islam: the absolute oneness of Allah. It emphasizes that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. Following this fundamental principle, the verse reminds everyone that Allah will certainly gather all people on the Day of Judgment. This future event is presented as a certainty, with no room for doubt. The verse concludes by asking a rhetorical question, highlighting the absolute truthfulness of Allah's word – whose promise or statement could possibly be more true or reliable than Allah's? This foundational declaration sets the stage for the subsequent verses, which deal with practical directives and laws for the Muslim community, grounding all actions and rules in the belief in Allah's oneness and accountability in the hereafter.","arabic":"فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَاللَّهُ أَرْكَسَهُمْ بِمَا كَسَبُوا ۚ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَهْدُوا مَنْ أَضَلَّ اللَّهُ ۖ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"88","text":"They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks;-","commentary":"Building on the principle of clarity established in the previous verse, this verse addresses a situation within the early Muslim community where there was disagreement on how to deal with certain individuals who outwardly claimed to be Muslim but inwardly opposed Islam and supported its enemies. The verse questions why the believers are divided into two groups regarding these \"hypocrites.\" It states that Allah has rejected or cast them aside because of their harmful actions and intentions. The verse then asks if anyone can guide those whom Allah has let go astray, implying that their behavior and intentions have led them so far from the right path that guidance from humans is ineffective. This highlights the danger of hypocrisy and the importance of recognizing it, warning the believers against a hesitant or tolerant stance towards those who undermine the community from within. The commentary suggests this verse likely refers to hypocrites living outside the main Muslim community in Madinah who claimed Islam but sided with the enemy.","arabic":"وَدُّوا لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُوا فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَاءً ۖ فَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدْتُمُوهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"89","text":"Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (Guarantees of) peace, then Allah Hath opened no way for you (to war against them).","commentary":"Continuing the theme from the previous verse about dealing with hypocrites, this verse exposes their true desire: they wish for the believers to abandon their faith and become disbelievers like themselves. It warns the believers not to form close alliances with such individuals unless they genuinely change their ways and commit to the cause of Allah, which in the historical context often involved migrating to join the Muslim community and live by its principles. The verse then gives a strong directive regarding those who actively turn against the Muslim community and become hostile enemies, stating they should not be taken as allies or helpers. The commentary clarifies that the stern measures mentioned are conditional on them actively opposing and turning hostile against the community, particularly referring to those outside the Muslim state who claimed faith but sided with its enemies. It emphasizes that the basis for alliance in Islam is shared belief and commitment, not tribal or worldly ties, and contrasts this firmness with Islam's general tolerance towards those of other faiths who are not hostile.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِيثَاقٌ أَوْ جَاءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَنْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ أَوْ يُقَاتِلُوا قَوْمَهُمْ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَاتَلُوكُمْ ۚ فَإِنِ اعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْا إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَمَ فَمَا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"90","text":"Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto: if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them.","commentary":"This verse provides important exceptions to the directives given in the previous verse regarding hostile groups. It specifies that the strong measures do not apply to those who seek refuge with or are part of a group with whom the Muslims have a peace treaty. It also makes an exception for individuals or groups who remain neutral, refraining from fighting against the Muslims or joining their own people in fighting them. The verse notes that if Allah had willed, these neutral parties could have been empowered to fight the Muslims, implying that their neutrality is a favor from Allah. Therefore, if they stay away, do not fight, and offer peace, the Muslims are instructed not to initiate hostilities against them. This demonstrates Islam's inclination towards peace when it is offered and does not compromise the core principles or security of the Muslim community, showing a balanced approach between firmness towards enemies and tolerance towards others who are peaceful or neutral.","arabic":"سَتَجِدُونَ آخَرِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَأْمَنُوكُمْ وَيَأْمَنُوا قَوْمَهُمْ كُلَّ مَا رُدُّوا إِلَى الْفِتْنَةِ أُرْكِسُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَعْتَزِلُوكُمْ وَيُلْقُوا إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَمَ وَيَكُفُّوا أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكُمْ جَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"91","text":"Never should a believer kill a believer; but (If it so happens) by mistake, (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased's family, unless they remit it freely.

If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom.","commentary":"This verse describes another group of people who try to maintain a deceptive position, attempting to gain trust from both the Muslims and their own people (who are hostile to Muslims). They pretend to be allies when with Muslims but easily fall back into disloyalty or hostility when with their own group. The verse states that if these individuals do not clearly separate themselves from hostility, offer peace, and cease their harmful actions, then the Muslims have a clear justification to deal with them firmly. The commentary explains that this refers to a specific type of hypocrite or double-dealer who actively undermines the Muslim community while trying to appear neutral or friendly for their own gain. It reinforces the principle that clear and consistent action, not deception, is required for peace or alliance, and that the Muslim community has a right to defend itself against such treacherous behavior.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ أَنْ يَقْتُلَ مُؤْمِنًا إِلَّا خَطَأً ۚ وَمَنْ قَتَلَ مُؤْمِنًا خَطَأً فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُؤْمِنَةٍ وَدِيَةٌ مُسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يَصَّدَّقُوا ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ مِنْ قَوْمٍ عَدُوٍّ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُؤْمِنَةٍ ۖ وَإِنْ كَانَ مِنْ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِيثَاقٌ فَدِيَةٌ مُسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ وَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُؤْمِنَةٍ ۖ فَمَنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ تَوْبَةً مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"92","text":"If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (For ever): And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him.","commentary":"Shifting from external relations, this verse addresses internal matters within the Muslim community, specifically the profound value of a believer's life. It declares emphatically that a believer should never intentionally kill another believer. If such a death occurs purely by mistake, Islamic law requires specific forms of compensation and atonement. These include freeing a believing enslaved person and paying financial compensation to the victim's family, unless the family generously chooses to waive the compensation. The verse then outlines variations based on the victim's circumstances: if the accidental victim was a believer living among a people hostile to Muslims, the requirement is only to free a believing enslaved person. If the victim was a believer from a people with whom Muslims have a peace treaty, both compensation to the family and freeing a believing enslaved person are required. For someone unable to afford these, a continuous two-month fast is prescribed as repentance. This detailed legislation underscores the sanctity of a believer's life and provides a framework for addressing accidental harm, highlighting Allah's comprehensive knowledge and wisdom in legislating for diverse situations. It contrasts the possibility of accidental killing with the severity of intentional killing discussed in the next verse.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِنًا مُتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاؤُهُ جَهَنَّمُ خَالِدًا فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَعَنَهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُ عَذَابًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"93","text":"O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: \"Thou art none of a believer!\" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do.","commentary":"Following the rules for accidental killing, this verse addresses the intentional killing of a believer. It states that the consequence for someone who deliberately murders a believer is an extremely severe divine punishment: dwelling in Hell eternally. The verse emphasizes the gravity of this act by adding that the killer incurs the wrath and curse of Allah, and that a dreadful punishment is prepared for them. The commentary notes that Islam views the intentional killing of a believer as a crime that deeply violates the bond of faith established by Allah between believers, considering it a transgression against the very idea of believing in Allah. The intensity of the language used reflects the enormity of taking a life intentionally, especially the life of someone bound by faith. This verse starkly differentiates intentional killing from accidental killing, emphasizing that the former carries severe divine retribution that cannot be simply compensated for in this life.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُوا وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَنْ أَلْقَىٰ إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَامَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فَعِنْدَ اللَّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كُنْتُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُوا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"94","text":"Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons.

Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-","commentary":"This verse instructs believers to exercise caution and discernment, especially when engaging in efforts for the cause of Allah, such as expeditions or travel. It specifically warns against hastily dismissing someone who offers the greeting of peace (a common sign among Muslims) as not being a believer, especially if motivated by a desire for worldly gain. The verse reminds believers that true, lasting rewards are with Allah, far superior to fleeting worldly possessions. It also brings attention to their own past state, perhaps referring to a time before they fully embraced Islam or when they had to conceal their faith, reminding them that Allah bestowed His grace upon them. Therefore, they should investigate matters carefully and not jump to conclusions or act on suspicion or greed. This teaching emphasizes the importance of assuming good faith, avoiding worldly motives in religious endeavors, and exercising thoroughness and fairness in dealing with others, highlighting that Allah is fully aware of their actions and intentions. It serves as a balance to the earlier verses, stressing caution and discernment in identifying believers, particularly when encountering people whose status might be unclear.","arabic":"لَا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ ۚ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً ۚ وَكُلًّا وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"95","text":"Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse highlights a significant difference in standing between believers who are active in struggling and sacrificing for Allah's cause, and those who remain inactive without a valid reason. It explains that those who actively strive, giving their wealth and risking their lives for Allah's cause, are granted a higher rank by Allah than those who stay home and face no hardship. While Allah has promised good to all believers, He distinguishes those who strive with a special, higher reward. This sets the stage for the following verses which further elaborate on this distinction and the consequences of inaction or migration.","arabic":"دَرَجَاتٍ مِنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"96","text":"When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: \"In what (plight) Were ye?\" They reply: \"Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth.\" They say: \"Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)?\" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge! -","commentary":"Continuing the theme from the previous verse, this verse clarifies the nature of the \"special reward\" promised by Allah to those who strive for His cause. It specifies that this reward includes elevated ranks specially granted by Allah, as well as His forgiveness and mercy. This underscores the immense value Allah places on sincere effort and sacrifice made for His sake, promising abundant reward and clemency in return.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنْتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"97","text":"Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men, women, and children - who have no means in their power, nor (a guide-post) to their way.","commentary":"This verse presents a stark scene of believers who remained in oppressive environments despite having the ability to migrate for the sake of their faith, prioritizing worldly comfort or possessions over living freely as Muslims. When the angels take their souls, they are questioned about their state, to which they offer the excuse of being \"weak and oppressed.\" The angels then challenge this excuse, pointing out that Allah's earth was vast enough for them to migrate and escape the oppression. This highlights the principle that if one is able to leave a place where they cannot freely practice their faith, they should do so. The verse warns that remaining inactive in such circumstances, when migration is possible, is seen as \"wronging oneself\" and can lead to a terrible outcome in the afterlife. This contrasts sharply with the value placed on striving and migration in the preceding verses.","arabic":"إِلَّا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"98","text":"For these, there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again.","commentary":"Following the stern warning in the previous verse, this verse provides a crucial exception. It clarifies that the warning about not migrating does not apply to those who are genuinely unable to leave. This includes men, women, and children who are truly helpless, lacking the physical ability, means, or guidance to escape the oppressive situation. This demonstrates the fairness and compassion of Allah, acknowledging that not everyone has the capacity to undertake migration, and their situation is understood differently.","arabic":"فَأُولَٰئِكَ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا"},{"verse":"99","text":"He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah, finds in the earth Many a refuge, wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger, His reward becomes due and sure with Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse continues from the previous one, offering hope and reassurance specifically to those who are genuinely helpless and unable to migrate from oppressive circumstances. For these individuals, Allah holds out the prospect of forgiveness. This highlights Allah's immense leniency and willingness to forgive repeatedly, emphasizing that He does not hold people accountable for duties they are truly incapable of fulfilling. This contrasts with the fate of those who were able but chose not to migrate (mentioned in Verse 97).","arabic":"وَمَنْ يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً ۚ وَمَنْ يَخْرُجْ مِنْ بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"100","text":"When ye travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers, for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies.","commentary":"This verse addresses the apprehensions someone might feel about leaving their home and familiar surroundings to migrate for the sake of Allah. It provides strong reassurance, promising that anyone who migrates for Allah's cause will find abundant refuge and resources elsewhere on earth. Furthermore, it offers a specific guarantee: even if a person undertaking this migration dies on the journey, their full reward for having migrated for Allah and His Messenger is assured with Allah from the moment they leave home. This highlights the importance and reward associated with prioritizing faith above worldly attachments and provides comfort against the fear of hardship or even death during the migration. It contrasts with the negative portrayal of those who chose not to migrate despite being able.","arabic":"وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَنْ تَقْصُرُوا مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ إِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَنْ يَفْتِنَكُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ إِنَّ الْكَافِرِينَ كَانُوا لَكُمْ عَدُوًّا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"101","text":"When thou (O Messenger) art with them, and standest to lead them in prayer, Let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with thee, Taking their arms with them: When they finish their prostrations, let them Take their position in the rear.

For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"Moving to practical aspects of living and traveling while potentially facing opposition, this verse discusses prayer. It grants permission to believers to shorten their prayers when they are traveling and have reason to fear attack from those who oppose them. This concession shows the flexibility of Islamic practice in challenging circumstances, prioritizing safety and vigilance while still maintaining the connection with Allah through prayer. The verse emphasizes the clear and present danger posed by opponents, highlighting the need for caution. This transitions the focus from the principle of migration to the practicalities of maintaining faith and safety while on the move or potentially facing hostility.","arabic":"وَإِذَا كُنْتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوا أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ فَإِذَا سَجَدُوا فَلْيَكُونُوا مِنْ وَرَائِكُمْ وَلْتَأْتِ طَائِفَةٌ أُخْرَىٰ لَمْ يُصَلُّوا فَلْيُصَلُّوا مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوا حِذْرَهُمْ وَأَسْلِحَتَهُمْ ۗ وَدَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ تَغْفُلُونَ عَنْ أَسْلِحَتِكُمْ وَأَمْتِعَتِكُمْ فَيَمِيلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَيْلَةً وَاحِدَةً ۚ وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنْ كَانَ بِكُمْ أَذًى مِنْ مَطَرٍ أَوْ كُنْتُمْ مَرْضَىٰ أَنْ تَضَعُوا أَسْلِحَتَكُمْ ۖ وَخُذُوا حِذْرَكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُهِينًا"},{"verse":"102","text":"When ye pass (Congregational) prayers, celebrate Allah's praises, standing, sitting down, or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger, set up Regular Prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's mention of prayer in fearful situations, this verse provides a detailed instruction for how Muslims should perform prayer when in a state of battle or imminent danger, specifically when praying congregationally behind the Prophet. It outlines a method where the congregation divides, with one group praying while the other provides guard, and then they switch roles. This demonstrates the immense importance of maintaining prayer even in the most critical and dangerous moments, while also emphasizing the absolute necessity of vigilance and preparedness against opponents who are constantly looking for an opportunity to attack. The verse allows for some flexibility (like putting down arms due to rain or illness) but reiterates the core principle of taking every precaution. It also offers reassurance by mentioning the humiliating punishment Allah has prepared for opponents, reinforcing the believers' confidence in Allah's support.","arabic":"فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ قِيَامًا وَقُعُودًا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِكُمْ ۚ فَإِذَا اطْمَأْنَنْتُمْ فَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ ۚ إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَابًا مَوْقُوتًا"},{"verse":"103","text":"And slacken not in following up the enemy: If ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have Hope from Allah, while they have none.

It encourages constant remembrance of Allah, whether standing, sitting, or lying down, acknowledging that circumstances might prevent the formal posture of prayer during danger. However, once the danger passes and security is restored, believers are commanded to re-establish the performance of regular prayers in their full form. This is because prayer is a duty prescribed for believers at specific times. This verse reinforces the importance of prayer as a fundamental obligation with set times, while showing the flexibility granted during exceptional circumstances, connecting constant remembrance with formal worship.","arabic":"وَلَا تَهِنُوا فِي ابْتِغَاءِ الْقَوْمِ ۖ إِنْ تَكُونُوا تَأْلَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ يَأْلَمُونَ كَمَا تَأْلَمُونَ ۖ وَتَرْجُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَرْجُونَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"104","text":"We have sent down to thee the Book in truth, that thou mightest judge between men, as guided by Allah: so be not (used) as an advocate by those who betray their trust;","commentary":"This verse concludes the passage by encouraging believers to persevere in their efforts and not lose heart when facing hardship, particularly in pursuing those who oppose them. It offers perspective by reminding believers that their opponents also face difficulties and suffering. However, the key difference lies in their mindset and ultimate hope: believers have hope for reward and support from Allah, something their opponents lack. This unique hope provides believers with a powerful source of strength and resilience to endure difficulties and continue their striving. The verse ends by affirming Allah's knowledge and wisdom, suggesting that His commands and insights into the situation are rooted in perfect understanding and a wise plan. This serves as a final encouragement, rooting the call for perseverance in trust in Allah's divine attributes and the distinct advantage believers have in their relationship with Him.","arabic":"إِنَّا أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِمَا أَرَاكَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَلَا تَكُنْ لِلْخَائِنِينَ خَصِيمًا"},{"verse":"105","text":"But seek the forgiveness of Allah; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse begins by reminding the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, that Allah has revealed the Qur'an to him with truth. The purpose of this revelation is for the Prophet to judge and settle disputes between people based on the guidance and knowledge given to him by Allah. The verse then gives a clear instruction: do not be an advocate or defender for those who are dishonest or who betray trust. This sets a fundamental principle that justice must be served impartially, regardless of who is involved, and that one should not support wrongdoing. This instruction came in the context of a specific incident where a group attempted to deflect blame for a theft onto an innocent person.","arabic":"وَاسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"106","text":"Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for Allah loveth not one given to perfidy and crime:","commentary":"Following the strong directive in the previous verse not to defend the dishonest, this verse instructs the Prophet (and by extension, all believers) to seek Allah's forgiveness. This serves as a reminder that even with the best intentions, humans can make mistakes, and seeking Allah's forgiveness is always available. It highlights Allah's nature as Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, showing that the door to repentance and mercy is constantly open for those who turn to Him. This verse connects back to the previous one by emphasizing humility and reliance on Allah even while striving for justice.","arabic":"وَلَا تُجَادِلْ عَنِ الَّذِينَ يَخْتَانُونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَنْ كَانَ خَوَّانًا أَثِيمًا"},{"verse":"107","text":"They may hide (Their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (Them) from Allah, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night, in words that He cannot approve: And Allah Doth compass round all that they do.","commentary":"This verse reiterates the command from Verse 105 not to argue or contend on behalf of those who are dishonest. It describes such individuals as \"betraying their own souls,\" meaning their actions ultimately harm themselves the most by incurring sin and divine displeasure. The verse explicitly states that Allah does not love those who are deceitful and persist in criminal behavior. This provides the divine reason behind the prohibition: such conduct is displeasing to Allah, making their defense inappropriate. It reinforces the link to the previous verses by emphasizing the seriousness of the act of dishonesty and its consequences.","arabic":"يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا"},{"verse":"108","text":"Ah! These are the sort of men on whose behalf ye may contend in this world; but who will contend with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Judgment, or who will carry their affairs through?","commentary":"This verse exposes the futility of trying to conceal wrongdoing from Allah. It points out that while dishonest people may attempt to hide their actions and plots from other humans, they cannot hide anything from Allah. Allah's knowledge is complete and encompasses everything; He is aware of their hidden intentions and secret plans, even when they conspire privately at night. The verse emphasizes that Allah disapproves of such schemes. This connects directly to the previous verse by highlighting the deceptive nature of the dishonest individuals and contrasting their limited ability to hide things from people with Allah's all-encompassing knowledge.","arabic":"هَا أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ جَادَلْتُمْ عَنْهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فَمَنْ يُجَادِلُ اللَّهَ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلًا"},{"verse":"109","text":"If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse continues the theme of divine justice and accountability. It highlights the contrast between this worldly life and the Day of Judgment. While some might attempt to defend or advocate for dishonest people in this world, the verse poses a powerful question: who will be able to defend them or manage their affairs before Allah on the Day of Judgment? This emphasizes that human efforts to shield wrongdoers are temporary and ultimately ineffective when facing Allah's perfect justice. It serves as a strong warning to both the dishonest individuals and anyone who might support them, linking the actions in this life to the ultimate accountability in the hereafter, building on the previous verses about Allah's awareness and disapproval.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ يَجِدِ اللَّهَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"110","text":"And if any one earns sin. he earns it against His own soul: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.","commentary":"Shifting focus from the severity of dishonesty and its consequences, this verse opens the door to hope and repentance. It states that if anyone commits a wrong deed or harms themselves through sin, but then sincerely seeks Allah's forgiveness, they will find that Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. This verse highlights the immense mercy of Allah, making it clear that forgiveness is available to anyone who turns to Him in sincere repentance, regardless of the wrong committed. It provides a pathway for those who have erred, contrasting with the dire consequences for the unrepentant mentioned in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَكْسِبْ إِثْمًا فَإِنَّمَا يَكْسِبُهُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"111","text":"But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is innocent, He carries (on himself) (Both) a falsehood and a flagrant sin.","commentary":"This verse establishes the fundamental principle of individual responsibility in Islam. It states that when a person commits a sin, they earn it against their own soul, meaning they alone bear the consequence and burden of that action. This underscores that there is no concept of inherited sin or one person bearing the responsibility for another's wrongdoing. It emphasizes that Allah's system is based on His perfect knowledge and wisdom, ensuring that accountability is just and specific to each individual's deeds. This principle reinforces the idea from Verse 110 that \"wronging one's own soul\" means incurring the consequence upon oneself.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَكْسِبْ خَطِيئَةً أَوْ إِثْمًا ثُمَّ يَرْمِ بِهِ بَرِيئًا فَقَدِ احْتَمَلَ بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"112","text":"But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy, a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But (in fact) they will only Lead their own souls astray, and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not (before): And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee.","commentary":"This verse addresses a particularly serious form of wrongdoing: committing a fault or sin and then falsely blaming it on an innocent person. This directly relates back to the context of the story mentioned earlier, where an attempt was made to blame a theft on an innocent individual. The verse states that someone who does this not only commits the original wrong but also burdens themselves with two additional major sins: the falsehood of making a false accusation and the grave sin of unjustly harming an innocent person's reputation or well-being. This highlights the severe consequences of compounding a wrong with deception and injustice towards others, connecting to the principles of individual accountability and the importance of protecting the innocent discussed in the previous verses.","arabic":"وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَهَمَّتْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ أَنْ يُضِلُّوكَ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۖ وَمَا يَضُرُّونَكَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ وَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَكَ مَا لَمْ تَكُنْ تَعْلَمُ ۚ وَكَانَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"113","text":"In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men, (Secrecy is permissible): To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall soon give a reward of the highest (value).","commentary":"This verse speaks specifically about the divine protection and guidance granted to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. It reveals that a group of people intended to deceive him and lead him away from the path of truth and justice in the specific incident being discussed. However, Allah's grace and mercy ensured that their plot failed. The verse states that their attempts to mislead others only resulted in them leading themselves astray, and they could not cause any harm to the Prophet in the least. This is attributed to Allah's immense favor upon the Prophet: revealing the Book (the Qur'an) and wisdom to him, and teaching him knowledge he did not possess before. This protection and guidance are highlighted as a great blessing from Allah, reinforcing the opening verses about the divine source and purpose of the Qur'an and the Prophet's role as a just judge guided by Allah.","arabic":"لَا خَيْرَ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِنْ نَجْوَاهُمْ إِلَّا مَنْ أَمَرَ بِصَدَقَةٍ أَوْ مَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ إِصْلَاحٍ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"114","text":"If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell,- what an evil refuge!","commentary":"This verse addresses the nature of secret discussions. It points out that most secret conversations don't lead to positive outcomes. However, it makes an exception for talks that encourage good deeds, such as giving to charity, acting justly, or helping to resolve disputes between people. It emphasizes that if someone engages in such secret talks with the sincere intention of earning Allah's approval, they will receive a great reward. This highlights that the intention behind a secret discussion, and whether it aims to benefit others or resolve issues, is what determines its value in the sight of Allah.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"115","text":"Allah forgiveth not (The sin of) joining other gods with Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this: one who joins other gods with Allah, Hath strayed far, far away (from the right).","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse, which touches on intentions and actions, this verse speaks about the consequence of rejecting clear guidance once it has been presented. It explains that if someone actively opposes the Messenger of Allah (Prophet Muhammad) after the truth has been made clear to them, and chooses a way of life different from that of the believers, Allah will let them continue on the path they have chosen. Ultimately, this path leads to Hell, which is described as a terrible destination. This emphasizes the importance of accepting and following divine guidance once it is understood.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَنْ يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا"},{"verse":"116","text":"(The Pagans), leaving Him, call but upon female deities: They call but upon satan the persistent rebel!","commentary":"This verse clarifies a crucial principle: associating partners with Allah in worship or in His unique attributes (often called Shirk in Arabic) is the one sin that Allah does not forgive if a person dies without repenting from it. However, Allah has the power to forgive any other sin for whomever He wills. The verse describes someone who associates partners with Allah as having gone severely astray from the correct path. This underscores the absolute oneness of Allah as the central tenet of Islamic faith and highlights the gravity of attributing divinity or divine rights to anyone or anything else.","arabic":"إِنْ يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِهِ إِلَّا إِنَاثًا وَإِنْ يَدْعُونَ إِلَّا شَيْطَانًا مَرِيدًا"},{"verse":"117","text":"Allah did curse him, but he said: \"I will take of Thy servants a portion Marked off;","commentary":"Connecting to the previous verses about misguidance and associating partners with Allah, this verse describes a form of polytheism practiced by some people before Islam, who worshipped female deities instead of or alongside Allah. It explains that when people turn away from Allah to worship others, they are in effect following the influence of Satan, who is described as a persistent rebel against Allah. This highlights the Islamic view that any form of worship directed away from Allah is ultimately a form of obedience or submission to the forces of misguidance represented by Satan.","arabic":"لَعَنَهُ اللَّهُ ۘ وَقَالَ لَأَتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيبًا مَفْرُوضًا"},{"verse":"118","text":"\"I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.\" Whoever, forsaking Allah, takes satan for a friend, hath of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest.","commentary":"This verse continues the theme introduced in the previous one about Satan's influence. It describes Allah's rejection of Satan due to his disobedience. Satan, in his defiance, vowed to mislead a significant number of Allah's servants, claiming a portion of them for himself. This sets the stage for the following verses, which detail some of the ways Satan attempts to lead people astray, illustrating the ongoing spiritual struggle between following Allah's guidance and succumbing to Satan's temptations.","arabic":"وَلَأُضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلَأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلَآمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ آذَانَ الْأَنْعَامِ وَلَآمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَّخِذِ الشَّيْطَانَ وَلِيًّا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَانًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"119","text":"Satan makes them promises, and creates in them false desires; but satan's promises are nothing but deception.","commentary":"Building on Satan's declaration in the previous verse, this verse outlines some of his specific methods for misleading people. These include instilling false desires, commanding actions seen as deviations from Allah's laws (like certain pre-Islamic practices such as ritually marking or slitting the ears of cattle), and corrupting the natural state or form that Allah created. The verse warns that anyone who abandons Allah's guidance and chooses Satan as their protector or master has certainly suffered a clear and undeniable loss, emphasizing the negative outcome of falling under Satan's influence.","arabic":"يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ ۖ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا"},{"verse":"120","text":"They (his dupes) will have their dwelling in Hell, and from it they will find no way of escape.","commentary":"Following the description of Satan's intentions and methods, this verse further elaborates on how Satan operates. It explains that Satan lures people by making appealing promises and stirring up enticing desires that are ultimately hollow and misleading. The verse explicitly states that all of Satan's promises are merely deceptions. This serves as a strong caution against being swayed by superficial attractions and temptations that divert one from the path of truth and righteousness, which connects to the eventual destination mentioned in the next verse.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَا يَجِدُونَ عَنْهَا مَحِيصًا"},{"verse":"121","text":"But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness,- we shall soon admit them to gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,-to dwell therein for ever. Allah's promise is the truth, and whose word can be truer than Allah's?","commentary":"This verse presents the grim consequence for those who are deceived by Satan's false promises and temptations, as described in the previous verses. It states that their ultimate dwelling place will be Hell, and there will be no way for them to escape it. This serves as a stark contrast to the reward promised to those who follow Allah's guidance, which is detailed in the following verse, highlighting the two very different outcomes depending on whether one follows Allah or is misled by Satan.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۖ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقًّا ۚ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ قِيلًا"},{"verse":"122","text":"Not your desires, nor those of the People of the Book (can prevail): whoever works evil, will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find, besides Allah, any protector or helper.","commentary":"In sharp contrast to the fate of those who follow Satan (mentioned in the previous verse), this verse describes the beautiful outcome for those who believe in Allah and live righteous lives. It promises that they will be admitted to Paradise, depicted as gardens with flowing rivers, where they will reside eternally. This is presented as Allah's true promise, and the verse emphasizes the absolute truthfulness of Allah's word, contrasting it with Satan's deceitful promises mentioned earlier.","arabic":"لَيْسَ بِأَمَانِيِّكُمْ وَلَا أَمَانِيِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ ۗ مَنْ يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ وَلَا يَجِدْ لَهُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"123","text":"If any do deeds of righteousness,- be they male or female - and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.","commentary":"Concluding this section which discussed guidance, misguidance, and their outcomes, this verse establishes a fundamental principle of divine justice. It makes it clear that achieving salvation or avoiding punishment is not based on mere wishful thinking or belonging to a particular group (referring here to Muslims and the \"People of the Book\" like Jews and Christians), but solely on one's actions. Anyone who commits evil will face the consequences, and they will find no protector or helper other than Allah. This underscores the universal nature of divine accountability based on deeds, not privilege or affiliation.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْ ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا"},{"verse":"124","text":"Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.","commentary":"This verse explains the fundamental principle for being rewarded by Allah and entering Paradise (Heaven). It makes it clear that the reward is based on two essential things: having sincere faith in Allah and doing good, righteous deeds. This applies equally to everyone, whether male or female. The verse emphasizes Allah's absolute justice, promising that anyone who fulfills these two conditions will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the slightest. It contrasts with any idea of special favour or automatic reward based on group identity; instead, it links the outcome directly to a person's belief and actions. This sets the stage for the next verse by defining what constitutes a praiseworthy life – one built on faith and good deeds.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۗ وَاتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ خَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"125","text":"But to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that Encompasseth all things.","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse, which outlines the requirements for Paradise (faith and good deeds), this verse describes the very best way of life. It defines someone \"better in religion\" as one who completely submits themselves to Allah – meaning to align their will and actions with Allah's guidance. This submission is coupled with doing good deeds, reiterating the importance mentioned in Verse 124. The verse highlights following the example of Prophet Abraham, who is presented as a model of pure faith, turning away from anything false and devoting himself entirely to Allah. It also mentions Prophet Abraham's special status, as Allah took him as a close friend. This verse shows that true faith, leading to good deeds, involves total submission to Allah, exemplified by Prophet Abraham.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُحِيطًا"},{"verse":"126","text":"They ask thy instruction concerning the women say: Allah doth instruct you about them: And (remember) what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book, concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed, and yet whom ye desire to marry, as also concerning the children who are weak and oppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deed which ye do, but Allah is well-acquainted therewith.","commentary":"This verse concludes this section by placing the principles of faith, action, and reward discussed in the previous verses within the context of Allah's supreme reality. It declares that Allah is the ultimate owner and ruler of everything in the vast universe, both in the heavens and on Earth. Nothing exists outside of His control or domain. The phrase \"He it is that Encompasseth all things\" means that Allah's knowledge and power surround and include everything. Understanding this absolute dominion reinforces the reasons why submitting to Allah, as mentioned in Verse 125, and living a life of faith and good deeds, as described in Verse 124, is the only logical and true path, as everything ultimately belongs to and is overseen by Him.","arabic":"وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِي النِّسَاءِ ۖ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ فِي يَتَامَى النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَنْ تَنْكِحُوهُنَّ وَالْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الْوِلْدَانِ وَأَنْ تَقُومُوا لِلْيَتَامَىٰ بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ وَمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِهِ عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"127","text":"If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint, Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.","commentary":"This verse addresses questions that arose about the rights and status of women, particularly concerning orphan girls and helpless children. It explains that Allah Himself is providing guidance on these matters. Historically, in pre-Islamic times, vulnerable groups like orphan girls and children were often treated unfairly, sometimes being denied their inheritance or prevented from marrying for the financial gain of their guardians. This verse specifically instructs people to be just towards orphans, ensuring they receive their due rights and fair treatment, especially regarding property and marriage. It reminds everyone that Allah is fully aware of every good deed performed. This highlights the importance of justice and fairness in society, particularly towards the most vulnerable, and sets the stage for further guidance on family relationships and individual conduct.","arabic":"وَإِنِ امْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِنْ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا أَوْ إِعْرَاضًا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَنْ يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحًا ۚ وَالصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ ۗ وَأُحْضِرَتِ الْأَنْفُسُ الشُّحَّ ۚ وَإِنْ تُحْسِنُوا وَتَتَّقُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"128","text":"Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether, so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding, and practise self-restraint, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the guidance on the general rights of women and orphans, this verse focuses on potential difficulties within a marriage. It addresses a situation where a wife is concerned about her husband's ill-treatment or neglect, which could lead to separation. To avoid the hardship of divorce, which is permissible but disliked, the verse suggests that the couple can reach a peaceful agreement. This settlement might involve the wife choosing to give up some of her rights, like financial support or her allotted share of the husband's time (in the case of multiple wives), if doing so helps preserve the marriage and brings peace. The verse emphasizes that \"peace is best.\" It acknowledges the human inclination towards self-interest but encourages kindness and being conscious of Allah in all actions, assuring that Allah is aware of everything done with good intentions. This verse connects to the previous one by continuing the theme of protecting women's welfare within the framework of Islamic guidance, offering a practical solution for marital strain.","arabic":"وَلَنْ تَسْتَطِيعُوا أَنْ تَعْدِلُوا بَيْنَ النِّسَاءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَمِيلُوا كُلَّ الْمَيْلِ فَتَذَرُوهَا كَالْمُعَلَّقَةِ ۚ وَإِنْ تُصْلِحُوا وَتَتَّقُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"129","text":"But if they disagree (and must part), Allah will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: for Allah is He that careth for all and is Wise.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion on relationships within a marriage, particularly in contexts where a man may be married to more than one woman. It acknowledges a natural human reality: it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain perfect emotional equity or equal affection between wives, even with the best intentions. However, while emotional inclination is beyond direct control, the verse strictly prohibits treating one wife unfairly or neglecting her rights altogether. This means a husband must strive for fairness in outward treatment, such as providing for them equally, dividing his time justly, and treating them with respect. The command is not to abandon a wife or neglect her rights, leaving her in a state of uncertainty, \"hanging\" without clear marital status. It encourages striving to do what is right and being conscious of Allah, promising that Allah is forgiving and merciful for any shortcomings in uncontrollable feelings, as long as one is just in actions and fears Allah. This verse builds on the theme of marital harmony and fairness discussed in the previous verse, providing specific guidance within the context of multiple marriages.","arabic":"وَإِنْ يَتَفَرَّقَا يُغْنِ اللَّهُ كُلًّا مِنْ سَعَتِهِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ وَاسِعًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"130","text":"To Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth. Verily we have directed the People of the Book before you, and you (o Muslims) to fear Allah. But if ye deny Him, lo! unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and Allah is free of all wants, worthy of all praise.","commentary":"Following the guidance on seeking peaceful reconciliation in marriage (Verse 128) and striving for fairness (Verse 129), this verse addresses the situation where disagreements between a husband and wife cannot be resolved, and separation becomes necessary. It acknowledges that despite efforts to maintain the marriage, sometimes parting is the only viable path. In such cases, the verse offers reassurance that even though the marriage ends, neither party is left without support. Allah, in His vast bounty and wisdom, will provide for both the husband and the wife individually. This provides comfort and emphasizes reliance on Allah even during difficult transitions like divorce, assuring that He cares for all His creation and will open new paths for both individuals. This verse serves as a conclusion to the specific guidance on marital disputes, transitioning to a broader theme of Allah's provision and control over all affairs.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَلَقَدْ وَصَّيْنَا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَنِ اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ وَإِنْ تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَنِيًّا حَمِيدًا"},{"verse":"131","text":"Yea, unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is Allah to carry through all affairs.","commentary":"This verse transitions from specific family laws to a fundamental principle that underpins all Islamic guidance: Allah's absolute ownership and control over everything in the universe. It states that because everything belongs to Allah, He alone has the right to set rules and give commands. The verse highlights a universal directive given to all previous communities who received divine revelations (\"People of the Book\") as well as to the Muslim community: to be conscious of Allah (often translated as \"fear Allah\"). This consciousness involves being aware of Allah's presence, power, and commands in all aspects of life, including family matters like those just discussed. The verse also points out that if people choose to disbelieve or ignore Allah's commands, it does not diminish Allah's dominion in any way, as He owns everything and is completely independent and self-sufficient, worthy of all praise regardless of human actions. This verse connects the specific laws previously mentioned to the larger universal system and the core command to live consciously aware of Allah.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا"},{"verse":"132","text":"If it were His will, He could destroy you, o mankind, and create another race; for He hath power this to do.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the message of the previous verse, emphasizing again that all that is in the heavens and on earth belongs entirely to Allah. It adds that Allah is sufficient to manage and carry out all affairs. This means that Allah's power and control are absolute, and nothing happens except by His will and knowledge. For believers, this serves as a source of comfort and reliance – knowing that the ultimate control rests with Allah, who is sufficient to handle all matters and provide for all needs. It also underscores the idea that submitting to Allah's commands, including those related to family and justice, is aligning oneself with the One who is in control of everything. This verse strengthens the foundation of divine authority established in Verse 131, highlighting Allah's comprehensive power and sufficiency.","arabic":"إِنْ يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ وَيَأْتِ بِآخَرِينَ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ قَدِيرًا"},{"verse":"133","text":"If any one desires a reward in this life, in Allah's (gift) is the reward (both) of this life and of the hereafter: for Allah is He that heareth and seeth (all things).","commentary":"Building on the themes of Allah's absolute ownership and power (Verses 131-132), this verse serves as a powerful reminder of humanity's dependence on Allah and the extent of His capability. It states clearly that if Allah willed, He could completely remove humanity and create a new creation in its place. This is not meant as a threat but to illustrate the vastness of Allah's power and His independence from humanity. It highlights that Allah's laws and guidance, including those regarding how people treat each other within families and society, are for humanity's benefit and not because Allah needs anything from them. It reinforces the call to be conscious of Allah by showing that human existence itself is entirely dependent on His will and power. This verse continues the theme of Allah's supreme power established in the preceding verses.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ يُرِيدُ ثَوَابَ الدُّنْيَا فَعِنْدَ اللَّهِ ثَوَابُ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"134","text":"O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.","commentary":"Concluding this section, this verse links human desires and actions to the concept of divine reward. It addresses those who may focus solely on achieving benefits and rewards in this worldly life. It reminds them that Allah is the ultimate source of all rewards, both in this life and in the afterlife. This encourages people to seek rewards from Allah by living according to His guidance, which includes the principles of justice, fairness, and consciousness of Allah mentioned in the preceding verses. By acting righteously and seeking Allah's pleasure, one can hope for good in this world and receive the immense reward of the afterlife. The verse ends by stating that Allah hears and sees all things, reinforcing the awareness of Allah's constant knowledge of our intentions and actions, which should motivate us to strive for what is good and just. This verse connects the divine laws and the call to be conscious of Allah with the ultimate outcome of human life – accountability and reward in both worlds.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ بِالْقِسْطِ شُهَدَاءَ لِلَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوِ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ ۚ إِنْ يَكُنْ غَنِيًّا أَوْ فَقِيرًا فَاللَّهُ أَوْلَىٰ بِهِمَا ۖ فَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا الْهَوَىٰ أَنْ تَعْدِلُوا ۚ وَإِنْ تَلْوُوا أَوْ تُعْرِضُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا"},{"verse":"135","text":"O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who believe, calling them to uphold justice with unwavering firmness. It emphasizes that when giving testimony or making a judgment, one must do so solely for the sake of Allah, regardless of personal feelings, relationships, or the social standing of those involved. This includes being just even if it means testifying against oneself, one's parents, or close relatives, or if the person is rich or poor. The principle is to prioritize truth and fairness, putting aside personal desires or biases that could lead one away from justice. The verse concludes with a reminder that Allah is fully aware of all actions, serving as a strong motivation for believers to adhere strictly to justice. This sets a high standard for the community's conduct, which is foundational for the discussions that follow.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا آمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۚ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا"},{"verse":"136","text":"Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe (again) and (again) reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way.","commentary":"Following the call to justice, this verse reinforces the core beliefs required of those who follow Islam. It directly calls upon believers to affirm their faith in Allah, in Prophet Muhammad as His Messenger, in the Qur'an revealed to him, and in the scriptures sent to prophets before him (like the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel). This highlights the continuity of divine revelation. The verse then states that anyone who denies these fundamental elements of faith – Allah, His angels, His revealed books, His messengers, and the Day of Judgment – has strayed significantly from the path of truth. This verse outlines the foundational faith that empowers believers to uphold the challenging standard of justice mentioned in the previous verse and prepares for understanding the distinction made in subsequent verses.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا ثُمَّ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا ثُمَّ ازْدَادُوا كُفْرًا لَمْ يَكُنِ اللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلَا لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"137","text":"To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;-","commentary":"Building on the definition of core beliefs, this verse describes a state of spiritual instability: people who accept faith, then abandon it, perhaps return to it, and repeatedly reject it, becoming increasingly hardened in their disbelief. The commentary explains that while initial disbelief followed by faith is forgiven, this pattern of repeatedly turning away after experiencing faith indicates a deliberate rejection of truth that is difficult to remedy. This repeated shift shows a deep-seated issue or lack of sincerity. This verse sets the stage for the following verses which discuss the characteristics and consequences for those who exhibit hypocrisy or a lack of true commitment.","arabic":"بَشِّرِ الْمُنَافِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"138","text":"Yea, to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them? Nay,- all honour is with Allah.","commentary":"This verse sharply shifts focus to a specific group: the hypocrites. By using the term \"glad tidings,\" which is usually used for good news, to describe a \"grievous penalty,\" the verse employs a form of stark sarcasm or derision. It serves as a pointed warning, suggesting that for those who outwardly claim faith but inwardly conceal disbelief or act contrary to their profession, a severe consequence awaits them. This short, impactful statement introduces the theme of hypocrisy which is further elaborated in the subsequent verses.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَتَّخِذُونَ الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۚ أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِنْدَهُمُ الْعِزَّةَ فَإِنَّ الْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا"},{"verse":"139","text":"Already has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:-","commentary":"This verse describes a defining characteristic of the hypocrites mentioned in the previous verse: their preference for forming alliances and seeking support from those who reject faith rather than from fellow believers. The verse questions their motive, asking if they seek 'honour' or 'status' from those who reject faith. It emphatically clarifies that true honour, strength, and dignity belong solely to Allah, and are attained by seeking His support and adhering to His path, not by aligning with those who oppose faith. This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the hypocrites about the true source of power and esteem.","arabic":"وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلَا تَقْعُدُوا مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ ۚ إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِثْلُهُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ جَامِعُ الْمُنَافِقِينَ وَالْكَافِرِينَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعًا"},{"verse":"140","text":"(These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\"- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): \"Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?\" but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers.","commentary":"This verse references a previous instruction revealed in the Qur'an, reminding believers that they should not remain in gatherings where Allah's revelations are being mocked or denied. It states that they should leave such company unless the conversation shifts to other topics. The warning is stark: if they stay and remain silent, they risk becoming like those who are ridiculing the faith, implying a shared responsibility or state of mind. The verse concludes with a powerful statement that Allah will ultimately gather both the hypocrites and those who openly reject faith together in the punishment of Hell. This guidance serves as a practical measure to protect the believers' faith and to distinguish them from those who lack sincerity, connecting to the description of hypocrites who align with opponents of faith mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِنْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ قَالُوا أَلَمْ نَكُنْ مَعَكُمْ وَإِنْ كَانَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُوا أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُمْ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۚ فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ وَلَنْ يَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"141","text":"The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah, but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to be seen of men, but little do they hold Allah in remembrance;","commentary":"This verse further illustrates the opportunistic and two-faced nature of the hypocrites described earlier. It depicts them as people who are observing the situation keenly, waiting to see who prevails. If the believers achieve a success granted by Allah, the hypocrites quickly claim to have been on their side. However, if those who reject faith gain an advantage, the hypocrites turn to them, claiming to have supported them and protected them from the believers. This reveals their lack of genuine commitment and their strategy of trying to be on the winning side, whichever it may be. The verse asserts that Allah will ultimately judge between these groups on the Day of Resurrection. It concludes with a significant promise: Allah will never grant those who reject faith a definitive way to triumph completely over the believers, as long as the believers remain true to their faith and fulfill its requirements. This promise provides reassurance to sincere believers, highlighting that ultimate victory and dominance belong to faith when it is truly upheld.","arabic":"إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ يُرَاءُونَ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"142","text":"(They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying,- never wilt thou find for him the way.","commentary":"Continuing the portrayal of hypocrites, this verse exposes their flawed thinking: they imagine they can deceive Allah, but it is Allah who allows them to be caught in their own deceit. This highlights their ignorance of Allah's all-encompassing knowledge. The verse then describes a key aspect of their religious practice, specifically their approach to prayer, which is a central act of worship in Islam. It states that when they stand for prayer, they do so reluctantly, primarily to be seen by other people rather than out of sincere devotion to Allah. They remember Allah only rarely. This paints a picture of their superficial religiosity, done for show rather than genuine faith, further distinguishing them from true believers whose prayer is heartfelt and for Allah's sake.","arabic":"مُذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ وَلَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ ۚ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"143","text":"O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves?","commentary":"This verse adds another layer to the description of the hypocrites' internal state, linking back to their insincere prayer and general conduct. It describes them as being unsettled and indecisive, not truly belonging to either the community of sincere believers or the group of those who openly reject faith. Their wavering position is a result of their lack of conviction. The verse emphasizes that for someone whom Allah allows to stray (due to their deliberate choices), it is impossible to find the correct path. This underscores the consequence of their instability and lack of sincerity, which leaves them without true guidance and prepares the ground for the subsequent warning.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۚ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"144","text":"The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them;-","commentary":"Returning to address the believers directly, this verse reiterates a crucial warning presented earlier (in verses 138-139). After detailing the negative characteristics and consequences of the hypocrites, particularly their alliances with those who reject faith, believers are strongly advised again not to take those who reject faith as allies or close friends instead of fellow believers. The verse poses a rhetorical question, asking if they desire to provide clear evidence *against themselves* to Allah by forming such alliances. This implies that choosing allegiance with those who oppose faith over the community of believers is an act that clearly demonstrates a flawed understanding of faith and opens one up to accountability before Allah. This serves as a final caution in this segment, reinforcing the importance of loyalty within the community of faith and warning against the path taken by hypocrites.\n\n---","arabic":"إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ وَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"145","text":"Except for those who repent, mend (their lives) hold fast to Allah, and purify their religion as in Allah's sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of immense value.","commentary":"This verse describes the ultimate fate of those who practice hypocrisy, stating that they will be in the lowest levels of the Fire in the Hereafter. This severe outcome is presented as a consequence of their actions and internal state described in the preceding verses, which depicted them as vacillating between believers and disbelievers, seeking alliance with the latter, and being insincere in their practice of faith like prayer. The verse emphasizes that in that state, they will find no one to help or support them, highlighting the complete isolation and absence of any protection from the consequence of their hypocrisy. Their earthly reliance on worldly allies will offer no benefit in the Hereafter.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا وَأَصْلَحُوا وَاعْتَصَمُوا بِاللَّهِ وَأَخْلَصُوا دِينَهُمْ لِلَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ وَسَوْفَ يُؤْتِ اللَّهُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"146","text":"What can Allah gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe? Nay, it is Allah that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things.","commentary":"Following the description of the severe fate of hypocrites in the previous verse, this verse offers a path to salvation. It clarifies that the outcome described in Verse 145 does not apply to those who turn away from hypocrisy through sincere repentance. These individuals are required to demonstrate their change by mending their lives, meaning they correct their behavior and actions to align with sincere faith. They must also \"hold fast to Allah,\" seeking refuge and strength solely in Him, and purify their religion, making their faith and devotion truly sincere and dedicated to Allah alone. By fulfilling these conditions, they will be counted among the genuine believers. The verse concludes by promising that Allah will grant all true believers, including those who sincerely repented and reformed, a great reward. This offers hope and emphasizes that the door of repentance is open, allowing individuals to change their destiny.","arabic":"مَا يَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ بِعَذَابِكُمْ إِنْ شَكَرْتُمْ وَآمَنْتُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ شَاكِرًا عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"147","text":"Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech, except where injustice hath been done; for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth all things.","commentary":"This verse provides a profound perspective on the relationship between Allah and humanity, particularly following the discussion of punishment and reward. It poses a rhetorical question, asking what benefit Allah would gain from punishing people if they choose to believe and be grateful. The implied answer is that Allah gains absolutely nothing from their punishment. This highlights that punishment is not for Allah's gain or pleasure, but rather a consequence of disbelief and ingratitude that people bring upon themselves. The verse then affirms that Allah is the one who appreciates goodness and is \"responsive to gratitude,\" meaning He values and rewards belief and thankfulness. He is All-Knowing, aware of people's innermost states and actions. This reinforces the idea that the path to Allah's favor, as described in Verse 146, is through sincere faith and gratitude, which are beneficial entirely to the individual, not to Allah.","arabic":"لَا يُحِبُّ اللَّهُ الْجَهْرَ بِالسُّوءِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ إِلَّا مَنْ ظُلِمَ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ سَمِيعًا عَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"148","text":"Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon, verily Allah doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values).","commentary":"This verse teaches about the importance of maintaining a high standard of social conduct and purity in speech. It explains that Allah does not approve of spreading evil or using bad language openly. Such speech can damage a community's trust and values, making evil seem commonplace and harming innocent people.\n\nHowever, there is an exception: if someone has been truly wronged, they are permitted to speak out about the injustice they have suffered. This is allowed within the context of seeking to address the wrong that has been done to them, to repel injustice, and to deter wrongdoers. It is a measure to restore justice, not an allowance for general foul language or libel.\n\nThe verse concludes by reminding us that Allah hears everything that is said and knows what is in people's hearts. This emphasizes that motives and intentions are known to Him.","arabic":"إِنْ تُبْدُوا خَيْرًا أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ أَوْ تَعْفُوا عَنْ سُوءٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا قَدِيرًا"},{"verse":"149","text":"Those who deny Allah and His messengers, and (those who) wish to separate Allah from His messengers, saying: \"We believe in some but reject others\": And (those who) wish to take a course midway,-","commentary":"Following the principle of avoiding evil speech, this verse encourages positive behavior. It highlights the value of doing good, whether it is done openly or in private. Both have benefits: doing good publicly can encourage others, while doing good privately helps purify the heart and soul.\n\nThe verse also encourages pardoning others for wrongs they may have done. Even when one has the right and ability to retaliate or seek justice (as mentioned in the previous verse's exception), choosing to pardon is presented as a higher and more commendable act. This forgiveness is encouraged by reminding us that Allah Himself is Oft-forgiving and powerful; He has the power to punish, yet He pardons sins. By forgiving others, we hope for Allah's forgiveness for ourselves. This verse connects to the previous one by moving from the prohibition of evil speech and a limited exception to the encouragement of doing good and pardoning others, promoting a more virtuous standard of behavior.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا"},{"verse":"150","text":"They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who reject faith, specifically highlighting the attitude of denying Allah and His messengers. It points out a specific group of people who claim to believe in Allah but reject His messengers, or claim to believe in some messengers while rejecting others. The verse describes this selective approach as a fundamental denial of faith.\n\nThe Islamic understanding is that belief in Allah necessitates believing in the messengers He sent to convey His message. Since the message comes from the One Allah, the messengers are considered part of a continuous chain, all bringing essentially the same core message of submitting to Allah. Therefore, accepting some messengers while rejecting others is seen as a rejection of the unity of the divine message itself, which stems from the unity of Allah. This verse introduces the category of those who adopt this partial belief.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُهِينًا"},{"verse":"151","text":"To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers, we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse provides the consequence for the attitude described in the previous one. It declares that those who deny Allah and His messengers, or who try to distinguish between Allah and His messengers or between the messengers themselves, are in fact disbelievers. Their claim of partial belief is not accepted, as faith is considered a complete, indivisible whole.\n\nBecause they are deemed disbelievers, the verse states that Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for them. This serves as a stern warning about the gravity of denying any part of the unified divine message brought by the messengers.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْهُمْ أُولَٰئِكَ سَوْفَ يُؤْتِيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا"},{"verse":"152","text":"The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle), for they said: \"Show us Allah in public,\" but they were dazed for their presumption, with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority.","commentary":"In contrast to the previous verses, this verse describes the believers and the reward they will receive. It defines believers as those who accept Allah and all of His messengers without making any distinction between them. This emphasizes the Islamic principle that all messengers, from the earliest like Prophet Noah and Prophet Abraham, to Prophet Moses, Prophet Jesus, and Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon them all, are respected and accepted as conveying the same fundamental message from Allah.\n\nThose who hold this comprehensive belief will be given their full reward by Allah. The verse ends by mentioning Allah's attributes of being Oft-forgiving and Most Merciful, suggesting that even for the believers, His forgiveness and mercy are essential for receiving their ultimate reward. This provides a clear distinction and outcome between the two groups described in the preceding verses: those who deny parts of the message face punishment, while those who accept the entirety are promised reward and receive Allah's mercy.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُكَ أَهْلُ الْكِتَابِ أَنْ تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ كِتَابًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ ۚ فَقَدْ سَأَلُوا مُوسَىٰ أَكْبَرَ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ فَقَالُوا أَرِنَا اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ بِظُلْمِهِمْ ۚ ثُمَّ اتَّخَذُوا الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ فَعَفَوْنَا عَنْ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ سُلْطَانًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"153","text":"And for their covenant we raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); and (on another occasion) we said: \"Enter the gate with humility\"; and (once again) we commanded them: \"Transgress not in the matter of the sabbath.\" And we took from them a solemn covenant.","commentary":"This verse addresses the demands made by some among the \"people of the Book\" (referring here primarily to the Jews) to Prophet Muhammad. They asked him to bring down a tangible book from heaven as proof of his message. The verse explains that this demanding and stubborn attitude is not new; it highlights their history with their own Prophet Moses, peace be upon him.\n\nIt recounts how they made an even greater and presumptuous demand of Prophet Moses, asking to see Allah directly. For this transgression, they were struck by a thunderbolt. Despite witnessing this and other clear signs, they later worshipped a golden calf while Prophet Moses was away. The verse mentions that Allah forgave them for this, and He gave Prophet Moses clear proofs of his authority and guidance. This historical account is mentioned to show that the demanding nature of the \"people of the Book\" towards Prophet Muhammad was consistent with their past behavior towards their own prophets, indicating a pattern of resistance to truth even when confronted with clear evidence.","arabic":"وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ الطُّورَ بِمِيثَاقِهِمْ وَقُلْنَا لَهُمُ ادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ لَا تَعْدُوا فِي السَّبْتِ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُمْ مِيثَاقًا غَلِيظًا"},{"verse":"154","text":"(They have incurred divine displeasure): In that they broke their covenant; that they rejected the signs of Allah; that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they said, \"Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah's Word; We need no more)\";- Nay, Allah hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy, and little is it they believe;-","commentary":"Continuing the historical account from the previous verse, this verse lists further instances of the Israelites' interactions with divine commands and covenants during the time of Prophet Moses. It mentions that Allah raised Mount Sinai above them as a witness to a solemn covenant they made, implying they were compelled to accept it.\n\nIt also recalls specific commands given to them: to enter a certain gate (referring to Jerusalem) in a state of humility, and the commandment not to violate the Sabbath law. Despite these clear instructions and the solemn covenant taken from them, their history showed a pattern of disobedience and breaking their pledges. This verse continues to build the historical narrative of the Israelites' challenges with following divine guidance, setting the stage for explaining why certain things were later made unlawful for them or why they faced consequences, as mentioned in later verses.","arabic":"فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِمْ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَكُفْرِهِمْ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَقَتْلِهِمُ الْأَنْبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ ۚ بَلْ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا"},{"verse":"155","text":"That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge;","commentary":"This verse lists several reasons why the Israelites incurred divine displeasure, directly linking them to their actions described in previous verses and adding new ones. These reasons include breaking the solemn covenants they had made, rejecting the clear signs sent by Allah, and unjustly killing prophets who were sent to them.\n\nIt also mentions their saying, \"Our hearts are enclosed\" or \"sealed.\" The commentary explains this could mean either they were suggesting their hearts were impervious to the Prophet's message, or that their hearts already contained sufficient knowledge from Allah's word, implying they had no need for further guidance. The verse refutes this claim, stating that it is Allah who has sealed their hearts due to their disbelief and blasphemy. This indicates that their inability or unwillingness to believe was a consequence of their rejection and actions, not an inherent state, and as a result, only a small number of them truly came to believe. This continues the narrative of their history of resistance to divine guidance.","arabic":"وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَانًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"156","text":"That they said (in boast), \"We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah\";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-","commentary":"This verse continues the list of actions that led to divine displeasure, specifying two further points. First, it reiterates their rejection of faith. This rejection is not just general disbelief but is tied to their specific actions and attitudes towards the divine message and messengers as previously described.\n\nSecond, it mentions the monstrous false charge they made against Mary, the mother of Prophet Jesus, peace be upon them. This refers to their accusation against her purity and honor, which is considered a grave slander in Islam. This highlights their severe hostility towards figures honored in Islam, even those they might be expected to respect based on their own traditions.","arabic":"وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَٰكِنْ شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِنْهُ ۚ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ ۚ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا"},{"verse":"157","text":"Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;-","commentary":"This verse addresses a particularly severe claim made by the Israelites: their boast that they killed Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. This claim is presented as another example of their transgression and arrogance, following the grave charge against his mother mentioned in the previous verse.\n\nThe verse then presents the Islamic truth regarding Prophet Jesus's end. It definitively states that they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him. Instead, it was made to appear to them as though they had. The verse adds that those who dispute this matter are filled with doubt and lack certain knowledge, relying only on speculation. It emphatically repeats that they did not kill him. The following verse (not included in the requested range) further clarifies that Allah raised him up to Himself. This verse is crucial for clarifying the Islamic belief about Prophet Jesus and refuting the historical narrative held by some others, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the event from other perspectives while providing a clear divine account.","arabic":"بَلْ رَفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"158","text":"And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;-","commentary":"This verse follows the previous one (Verse 157) which discusses the claim that Prophet Jesus was killed and crucified. This verse clarifies that this claim is false. Allah states clearly that Prophet Jesus was not killed or crucified as some people claimed. Instead, Allah raised him up unto Himself. This indicates a special event where Prophet Jesus was taken by Allah. The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah is Exalted in Power and Wise, meaning He has the ability to do whatever He wills, and His actions are always based on wisdom. This serves as a powerful affirmation of the truth regarding Prophet Jesus's fate, directly from the Divine perspective.","arabic":"وَإِنْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"159","text":"For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from Allah's Way;-","commentary":"Continuing the discussion about Prophet Jesus, this verse speaks about the People of the Book (followers of earlier revelations, like Jews and Christians). It states that, eventually, every one of them will believe in Prophet Jesus before their own death. This could refer to the moments before one's soul leaves the body, when certain truths become clear, though it is then too late for this belief to be of benefit in the hereafter. It also mentions that Prophet Jesus will be a witness against them on the Day of Judgment, presumably regarding their beliefs and actions concerning him and his message. This follows from the previous verse's assertion of Prophet Jesus's true fate, highlighting the significance of belief in him.","arabic":"فَبِظُلْمٍ مِنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُوا حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَاتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا"},{"verse":"160","text":"That they took usury, though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men's substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment.","commentary":"This verse begins to list some reasons why certain things that were previously allowed for the historical Jewish people were later restricted for them. The primary reason given here is \"their iniquity,\" which refers to their wrongdoing and sinfulness. It specifically mentions that they hindered many people from Allah's Way, meaning they actively tried to prevent others from following the path guided by Allah. As a consequence of these actions, Allah made certain good and wholesome foods unlawful for them, things that had been permissible before. This demonstrates a divine consequence for persistent wrongdoing and obstruction of guidance.","arabic":"وَأَخْذِهِمُ الرِّبَا وَقَدْ نُهُوا عَنْهُ وَأَكْلِهِمْ أَمْوَالَ النَّاسِ بِالْبَاطِلِ ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا"},{"verse":"161","text":"But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And (especially) those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in Allah and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a great reward.","commentary":"Adding to the list of wrongdoings from the previous verse, this verse highlights two more actions of the historical Jewish people that led to consequences: they took usury (interest on loans), even though it had been forbidden to them, and they wrongfully consumed other people's property. These acts of financial exploitation and injustice are presented as further examples of their deviation. For those among them who persisted in rejecting faith despite the guidance and warnings, Allah states that a grievous punishment has been prepared for them in the hereafter. This verse reinforces the link between their specific harmful actions and the severe consequences they would face.","arabic":"لَٰكِنِ الرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ مِنْهُمْ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ ۚ وَالْمُقِيمِينَ الصَّلَاةَ ۚ وَالْمُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ أُولَٰئِكَ سَنُؤْتِيهِمْ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا"},{"verse":"162","text":"We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.","commentary":"In contrast to the people described in the previous verses who rejected faith and committed wrongdoings, this verse highlights a positive exception. It speaks of those among the People of the Book (specifically mentioning those with profound knowledge) and other believers who accepted the message revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), recognizing its consistency with what was revealed before him through earlier prophets. These are described as people who are firm in their faith, practice regular prayer, give to charity, and truly believe in Allah and the Last Day. This shows that not all individuals among earlier communities behaved in the same way, and those who embraced the truth, regardless of their background, are promised a great reward from Allah.","arabic":"إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا"},{"verse":"163","text":"Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We have not;- and to Moses Allah spoke direct;-","commentary":"Addressing Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), this verse establishes the continuity of divine revelation throughout history. It explains that the inspiration (revelation) given to him is not a new phenomenon, but rather follows the same pattern as the revelations sent to Prophet Noah and all the messengers who came after him. The verse then lists many of these noble messengers, including Prophet Abraham, Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Isaac, Prophet Jacob and his descendants, Prophet Jesus, Prophet Job, Prophet Jonah, Prophet Aaron, and Prophet Solomon. It also specifically mentions giving the Psalms to Prophet David. This list emphasizes that Prophet Muhammad is part of a long, consistent line of messengers chosen by Allah.","arabic":"وَرُسُلًا قَدْ قَصَصْنَاهُمْ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَرُسُلًا لَمْ نَقْصُصْهُمْ عَلَيْكَ ۚ وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا"},{"verse":"164","text":"Messengers who gave good news as well as warning, that mankind, after (the coming) of the messengers, should have no plea against Allah: For Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","commentary":"This verse continues the theme of divine messengership from the previous verse. It acknowledges that while the Qur'an mentions some messengers by name and recounts parts of their stories (as seen in the previous verse and throughout the Qur'an), there were also many other messengers sent by Allah whose stories have not been mentioned. This shows the vastness of Allah's communication with humanity throughout time. The verse also specifically highlights a unique aspect of Prophet Moses's relationship with Allah: that Allah spoke to him directly. This detail about Prophet Moses is presented as a distinct form of divine communication among the messengers.","arabic":"رُسُلًا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"165","text":"But Allah beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His (own) knowledge, and the angels bear witness: But enough is Allah for a witness.","commentary":"Building upon the mention of numerous messengers in the preceding verses (163-164), this verse explains their essential role and purpose. Messengers were sent to bring good news to those who believe and obey Allah, promising them guidance and reward, while also giving warning to those who disbelieve and disobey, informing them of the consequences. The fundamental reason for sending these messengers throughout history is explicitly stated: so that humanity would have no excuse or argument before Allah on the Day of Judgment. By sending messengers with clear messages, Allah ensures that people are fully informed of their responsibilities and the path to guidance. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's attributes: Exalted in Power, meaning He has complete authority, and Wise, meaning all His actions and decisions, including sending messengers, are based on perfect wisdom.","arabic":"لَٰكِنِ اللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ أَنْزَلَهُ بِعِلْمِهِ ۖ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يَشْهَدُونَ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا"},{"verse":"166","text":"Those who reject Faith and keep off (men) from the way of Allah, have verily strayed far, far away from the Path.","commentary":"Following the explanation of the purpose of messengers, this verse directly addresses Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the authenticity of the message he received. It serves as a powerful affirmation from Allah in the face of any doubt or denial from others. Allah Himself bears witness that the revelation sent down to the Prophet originates from Allah's own infinite knowledge. Furthermore, the angels, who are messengers of Allah and involved in the process of conveying revelation, also bear witness to this truth. The verse concludes by stating that Allah's testimony alone is sufficient, emphasizing His ultimate authority and truthfulness. This verse provides reassurance to the Prophet and believers about the divine source of the message.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّوا ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا"},{"verse":"167","text":"Those who reject Faith and do wrong,- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any way-","commentary":"This verse describes the state of those who reject faith and actively prevent others from following Allah's path. It highlights their significant deviation from the truth. Their rejection of faith is coupled with hindering others, indicating a double wrongdoing: they not only deny the truth themselves but also work to keep others away from it. The verse emphasizes that such people have gone profoundly astray, losing their way completely. This serves as a warning about the severe consequences of both disbelief and actively opposing the spread of divine guidance, contrasting sharply with the path of believers discussed in previous verses.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَظَلَمُوا لَمْ يَكُنِ اللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلَا لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ طَرِيقًا"},{"verse":"168","text":"Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein for ever. And this to Allah is easy.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who choose to reject faith and persistently commit wrongdoing. It explains that, due to their actions and denial of the truth, Allah will not grant them forgiveness in the hereafter nor guide them towards a path of salvation. This outcome is a direct consequence of their choices and consistent refusal to accept guidance, following the principle that actions have consequences. It sets the stage for the subsequent verse by describing the state of those who actively turn away from divine guidance and justice.","arabic":"إِلَّا طَرِيقَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا"},{"verse":"169","text":"O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from Allah: believe in him: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith, to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.","commentary":"Following from the previous verse, this verse clarifies the ultimate consequence for those who reject faith and do wrong: their path leads only to Hell, where they will remain eternally. It emphasizes the finality of this state for those who die in such a condition. The phrase \"And this to Allah is easy\" underscores Allah's absolute power and ability to bring about this consequence without any difficulty, reinforcing the certainty and justice of the outcome for those who deliberately choose the path of disbelief and persistent wrongdoing.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمُ الرَّسُولُ بِالْحَقِّ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ فَآمِنُوا خَيْرًا لَكُمْ ۚ وَإِنْ تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا"},{"verse":"170","text":"O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not \"Trinity\": desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.","commentary":"This verse is a universal call to all humanity. It proclaims that Prophet Muhammad has come to them with the truth from Allah, urging them to believe in him and the message he conveys. The verse presents belief as being in their own best interest, leading to their benefit in this life and the hereafter. It then contrasts this by stating that if they choose to disbelieve, it does not diminish Allah in any way, as He is the possessor of everything in the heavens and on the earth, completely self-sufficient and independent of creation. It concludes by affirming that Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise, highlighting that His message and His judgment are based on perfect knowledge and wisdom. This verse serves as a concluding address following the preceding discussion on messengers, belief, disbelief, and consequences, presenting a clear invitation and warning to all people.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا تَغْلُوا فِي دِينِكُمْ وَلَا تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ ۚ إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَقُولُوا ثَلَاثَةٌ ۚ انْتَهُوا خَيْرًا لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّمَا اللَّهُ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ سُبْحَانَهُ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ ۘ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا"},{"verse":"171","text":"Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship Allah, nor do the angels, those nearest (to Allah): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant,-He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer).","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing the \"People of the Book,\" a term in the Qur'an often referring to communities who received earlier scriptures, such as the Jews and Christians. It calls upon them not to exceed the bounds of truth in their religious beliefs and to speak only truth about Allah.\n\nThe verse then directly addresses the nature of Prophet Jesus, son of Mary. It states clearly that Prophet Jesus was a messenger of Allah, His Word conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. From a Muslim perspective, Prophet Jesus is a highly respected prophet, born miraculously by Allah's command (\"Be!\"). This birth, while miraculous, does not elevate him to a divine status.\n\nThe verse then explicitly advises against the concept of a \"Trinity,\" stating that desisting from this idea is better. It reaffirms the fundamental Islamic belief in the absolute Oneness of Allah, emphasizing that Allah is far above having a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah, and He alone is sufficient as the ultimate guardian and sustainer of all affairs. This explanation contrasts the Islamic belief in strict monotheism with the concept of Trinity.","arabic":"لَنْ يَسْتَنْكِفَ الْمَسِيحُ أَنْ يَكُونَ عَبْدًا لِلَّهِ وَلَا الْمَلَائِكَةُ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ ۚ وَمَنْ يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيْهِ جَمِيعًا"},{"verse":"172","text":"But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find, besides Allah, any to protect or help them.","commentary":"Following the declaration of Prophet Jesus's true nature as a messenger and the emphasis on Allah's absolute Oneness in the previous verse (171), this verse clarifies that Prophet Jesus himself never considered it beneath him to be a servant and worshipper of Allah. Similarly, the angels closest to Allah also do not consider it beneath them to serve and worship Him.\n\nThis point is made to reinforce the idea that servitude and worship are due to Allah alone, and even the most honored of creation, like Prophet Jesus and the highest angels, humbly fulfill this role. It sets a standard, showing that accepting the role of being a servant of Allah is not a matter of pride or status, but the natural and true relationship between creation and the Creator. The verse then introduces the contrast: those who *do* disdain His worship and are arrogant about it will be gathered before Allah to answer for their attitude, setting the stage for the consequences mentioned in the next verse (173).","arabic":"فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ اسْتَنْكَفُوا وَاسْتَكْبَرُوا فَيُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا وَلَا يَجِدُونَ لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا"},{"verse":"173","text":"O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: For We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest.","commentary":"Building on the distinction made in the previous verse (172) between those who humbly serve Allah and those who are arrogant, this verse outlines the differing outcomes for these two groups.\n\nIt promises that those who believe in Allah and act righteously will receive their full reward, and even more, out of Allah's immense generosity. This highlights the positive consequence of embracing faith and righteous conduct.\n\nIn contrast, those who were disdainful and arrogant regarding Allah's worship will face a severe punishment. This emphasizes the serious nature of rejecting or being too proud to serve Allah, the Creator of all things. The verse concludes by stating that these arrogant individuals will find no one besides Allah who can offer them protection or help, underscoring Allah's absolute authority and the futility of seeking help from others against His judgment. This connects directly back to the warning given in verse 172.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بُرْهَانٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ نُورًا مُبِينًا"},{"verse":"174","text":"Then those who believe in Allah, and hold fast to Him,- soon will He admit them to mercy and grace from Himself, and guide them to Himself by a straight way.","commentary":"Following the specific address to the People of the Book and the discussion about the nature of Prophet Jesus and the consequences of belief or arrogance (verses 171-173), this verse broadens the address to all of humanity (\"O mankind!\"). It declares that a clear and convincing proof has come to them from their Lord, Allah.\n\nThis \"convincing proof\" and the \"manifest light\" primarily refer to the Qur'an itself and the message brought by Prophet Muhammad. It is presented as a powerful evidence of truth from Allah, designed to clarify matters of faith and guidance. This transition serves as a general call to all people to recognize the truth and clarity offered by the final revelation, setting the stage for the benefits of responding positively to this call, as described in the next verse (175).","arabic":"فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَاعْتَصَمُوا بِهِ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِي رَحْمَةٍ مِنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا"},{"verse":"175","text":"They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, Her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance (between them): if there are brothers and sisters, (they share), the male having twice the share of the female. Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His law), lest ye err. And Allah hath knowledge of all things.","commentary":"This verse describes the blessed outcome for those who respond to the call presented in the previous verse (174). It highlights the response required: believing in Allah and holding fast to Him.\n\n\"Holding fast to Him\" implies seeking refuge, strength, and guidance solely from Allah, relying on Him completely. For those who do this, the verse promises that Allah will soon admit them into His mercy and grace. Furthermore, He will guide them directly to Himself along a straight path. This imagery suggests a clear, unobstructed journey towards Allah, facilitated by His guidance and favor. It shows the intimate connection and support Allah provides to those who sincerely turn to Him and rely on Him, illustrating the positive result of accepting the proof and light mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِي الْكَلَالَةِ ۚ إِنِ امْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ ۚ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَا إِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهَا وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَتَا اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا الثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ۚ وَإِنْ كَانُوا إِخْوَةً رِجَالًا وَنِسَاءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ ۗ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَضِلُّوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"176","text":"","commentary":"This final verse of the Sura shifts to a specific legal ruling concerning inheritance. It responds to a query about the estate of someone who leaves no direct descendants (children or grandchildren) or ascendants (parents or grandparents). This situation is referred to as *kalalah*.\n\nThe verse provides clear directives from Allah regarding how the inheritance of such a person is to be distributed among siblings. It specifies the share for a single sister when a man dies childless, the share for a brother when a woman dies childless, and the share for two or more sisters. It also lays down the general rule for sharing among both brothers and sisters, where the male receives a portion double that of the female.\n\nThe verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah makes these laws clear to prevent people from erring, and that Allah has full knowledge of all things. This concluding remark reinforces the divine source and wisdom behind Islamic law, linking these practical rules back to the overarching authority and knowledge of Allah, a theme woven throughout the Sura. Its placement at the end also brings the Sura to a close with a matter of social and familial order, echoing some of the themes addressed earlier in this long chapter.","arabic":""}];
