    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Praise be Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold (others) as equal, with their Guardian-Lord.","commentary":"This verse opens the chapter by declaring that all praise is due to Allah alone. It highlights Allah as the Creator of everything in existence, specifically mentioning the vastness of the heavens and the earth, and the fundamental phenomena of darkness and light. These are presented as magnificent signs of Allah's power and planning in the universe. The verse then notes the paradox that despite this clear evidence of a single, Supreme Creator, some people still choose to associate others or other things as equals to Allah, who is their sustainer and guardian. This sets the central theme of the chapter: the importance of recognizing Allah's unique oneness and the error of associating partners with Him.","arabic":"الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ ۖ ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ"},{"verse":"2","text":"He it is created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). And there is in His presence another determined term; yet ye doubt within yourselves!","commentary":"Building on the theme of creation from the previous verse, this verse focuses specifically on the creation of humanity. It states that Allah created humans from clay, connecting human existence to the very substance of the earth, which Allah also created. It then explains that Allah has decreed a specific term for each person's life (their death). Additionally, there is another term known only to Allah, which refers to the time when all will be gathered for accountability (the Day of Resurrection). Despite these clear signs of Allah's power over life and death, and the certainty of an appointed time, the verse observes that some people remain in doubt. This verse transitions from the creation of the cosmic universe to the creation and destiny of humankind, emphasizing Allah's control over both.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ طِينٍ ثُمَّ قَضَىٰ أَجَلًا ۖ وَأَجَلٌ مُسَمًّى عِنْدَهُ ۖ ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ تَمْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, and what ye reveal, and He knoweth the (recompense) which ye earn (by your deeds).","commentary":"This verse reinforces the concept introduced in the first two verses: that the same Allah who created the heavens, earth, and humankind is the sole divine authority present everywhere, in the heavens and on earth. It emphasizes Allah's absolute knowledge, stating that He knows everything people keep secret within themselves and everything they do openly. Furthermore, He is fully aware of the consequences or recompense of all their actions. This comprehensive knowledge implies accountability for human choices. By highlighting Allah's omnipresence and omniscience immediately after mentioning His creation and the appointed terms of life and judgment, the verse underlines that He is the ultimate authority and judge, connecting the power of creation with the power of knowledge and accountability for human actions.","arabic":"وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَفِي الْأَرْضِ ۖ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but they turned away therefrom.","commentary":"This verse describes the attitude of people who do not believe. It explains that whenever evidence or signs from Allah come to them, guiding them toward recognizing Him and His message, they deliberately turn away from these signs. This highlights a key challenge faced by messengers throughout history: people choosing to ignore the clear indications of truth. This verse sets the stage for the following verses by showing the initial negative reaction to divine signs.","arabic":"وَمَا تَأْتِيهِمْ مِنْ آيَةٍ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا كَانُوا عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learn the reality of what they used to mock at.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this highlights that the rejection isn't just passive turning away; it's an active denial of the truth once it has been clearly presented. The verse then issues a warning that these individuals will eventually understand the real consequences or the truth of what they previously made fun of or dismissed. This serves as a reminder that actions have consequences, and the reality that is denied now will become evident later. It directly follows Verse 4, detailing the outcome of the attitude described there.","arabic":"فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوا بِالْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ ۖ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِيهِمْ أَنْبَاءُ مَا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them).","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to historical examples as a lesson for those who reject the truth. It prompts reflection by asking if people have considered the fate of earlier nations. It points out that Allah had granted these past civilizations great strength, resources, and prosperity (like abundant rain and flowing rivers) – perhaps even more than the people being addressed now. However, despite their power and wealth, they were destroyed because of their wrongdoing and deviation from Allah's guidance. The verse emphasizes that Allah then replaced them with new generations. This shows Allah's power and serves as a warning that worldly strength and resources do not guarantee safety from consequences if one rejects the truth and commits widespread sin. It connects to the warning in Verse 5 by providing concrete historical examples of what happens to those who deny and mock the truth.","arabic":"أَلَمْ يَرَوْا كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ مِنْ قَرْنٍ مَكَّنَّاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَا لَمْ نُمَكِّنْ لَكُمْ وَأَرْسَلْنَا السَّمَاءَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِدْرَارًا وَجَعَلْنَا الْأَنْهَارَ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهِمْ فَأَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَأَنْشَأْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْنًا آخَرِينَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"If We had sent unto thee a written (message) on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: \"This is nothing but obvious magic!\"","commentary":"This verse illustrates the depth of the rejection described in the previous verses. It highlights a level of stubbornness where even if Allah were to send the message in a physical form, like writing on paper that people could see and touch, those who are determined not to believe would still dismiss it. They would rationalize it away, claiming it was merely a trick or magic. This shows that their issue is not a lack of evidence, but a refusal to accept the truth, no matter how it is presented. It underscores the challenging nature of conveying a divine message when faced with such deep-seated denial, connecting back to the initial description of their attitude in Verses 4 and 5.","arabic":"وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَابًا فِي قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"They say: \"Why is not an angel sent down to him?\" If we did send down an angel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be granted them.","commentary":"Here, the verse addresses one of the specific demands made by people who did not believe: they asked why an angel wasn't sent down visibly with the messenger to confirm his truthfulness. The response explains that angels appear on Earth for specific, significant purposes, often related to divine judgment or the conclusion of matters. If Allah were to send an angel visibly in response to their challenge, it would be a sign of finality, leaving no more time for them to change their minds and accept the truth. This implies that Allah, in His mercy, is giving them time and opportunities through a human messenger rather than bringing a decisive angelic manifestation that would lead to immediate consequences for their rejection. This verse begins a short discussion about the nature of angels, leading into the next verse.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ ۖ وَلَوْ أَنْزَلْنَا مَلَكًا لَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ثُمَّ لَا يُنْظَرُونَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.","commentary":"Continuing the explanation from Verse 8 about why an angel wasn't sent visibly, this verse adds another point. It clarifies that even if Allah *did* choose to send an angel as a messenger to humanity, the angel would appear in human form. This is because humans live in the physical world and can best relate to and interact with someone who shares their physical form. Sending an angel in its true, non-human form would not be suitable for human interaction or for conveying a message meant for people. The verse concludes by stating that sending an angel as a man would only add to the existing confusion of those who were already questioning and confused about why a human being (Prophet Muhammad) was chosen as a messenger. This highlights their existing state of doubt and the inappropriate nature of their demand for a visible angel. It directly follows Verse 8, explaining further the reasons behind Allah's choice of a human messenger.","arabic":"وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَاهُ مَلَكًا لَجَعَلْنَاهُ رَجُلًا وَلَلَبَسْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَا يَلْبِسُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Mocked were (many) messengers before thee; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked.","commentary":"This verse provides perspective and reassurance by stating that the current messenger (Prophet Muhammad) is not the first to be ridiculed or mocked. Many messengers before him faced similar treatment from the people they were sent to. However, the verse adds a powerful consequence: those who mocked and scoffed at the messengers were eventually overtaken and surrounded by the very thing they mocked – the divine punishment or the reality of the message they dismissed. This serves as both comfort to the messenger that his experience is part of a pattern, and a stark warning to those who are currently mocking. It connects to the warnings in Verses 5 and 6 by reinforcing that mocking Allah's messengers and message inevitably leads to negative consequences for the mockers.","arabic":"وَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِالَّذِينَ سَخِرُوا مِنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"Say: \"Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth.\"","commentary":"Following the reference to the fate of mockers in Verse 10, this verse issues a direct command to travel the world. The purpose of this travel is not just for trade or exploration, but specifically to observe and reflect upon the remnants and historical signs of civilizations that rejected the truth and denied Allah's messengers. By seeing the physical evidence of the destruction or decline of these past nations, people can learn from history and understand the inevitable outcome for those who persistently reject divine guidance. This encourages a conscious effort to reflect on the past as a way to guide present behavior and reinforces the historical lessons mentioned in Verse 6.","arabic":"قُلْ سِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ انْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Say: \"To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?\" Say: \"To Allah. He hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) Mercy. That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe.","commentary":"This verse begins by asking a fundamental question: who owns everything in the heavens and on earth? The answer is immediately provided: it belongs to Allah. This establishes Allah's absolute ownership over the entire universe. The verse then highlights a profound aspect of Allah's nature, stating that He has committed Himself to mercy. This means that mercy is a principle that governs His interaction with His creation, stemming purely from His own will and generosity. The verse also confirms with certainty that everyone will be gathered together on the Day of Judgment. This gathering is also seen as an act of Allah's care and mercy, as it signifies that Allah has a purpose for creation and will account for all deeds. The verse concludes by pointing out that those who deny this reality are the ones who have truly lost themselves because they reject the very truth that could guide them. This verse sets the stage by asserting Allah's absolute ownership and His commitment to mercy, linking it to the certainty of accountability in the hereafter.","arabic":"قُلْ لِمَنْ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ قُلْ لِلَّهِ ۚ كَتَبَ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ ۚ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"To him belongeth all that dwelleth (or lurketh) in the night and the day. For he is the one who heareth and knoweth all things.\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse's assertion of Allah's ownership of everything in the universe in terms of place (heavens and earth), this verse reinforces that ownership in terms of time, stating that everything that exists or rests, whether by night or by day, belongs to Allah. This emphasizes His dominion over all creation at all times. It then adds two of Allah's attributes: He is the One who hears all things and knows all things. This means Allah is fully aware of everything that happens within His creation, including the actions and words of all beings, both openly and secretly. This serves as a reminder that nothing is hidden from Allah, connecting back to His ultimate authority established in the previous verse and His complete knowledge of all things.","arabic":"وَلَهُ مَا سَكَنَ فِي اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Say: \"Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? And He it is that feedeth but is not fed.\" Say: \"Nay! but I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah (in Islam), and be not thou of the company of those who join gods with Allah.\"","commentary":"This verse directly confronts the idea of seeking protection, support, or ultimate authority from anyone other than Allah. It presents a powerful argument based on Allah's unique attributes: He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who provides sustenance to all, needing nothing Himself. The question posed, \"Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah?\", highlights the illogic of turning to anything less powerful or self-sufficient than the Creator and Sustainer. The response is a firm rejection, stating that the Prophet (and by extension, every Muslim) is commanded to be among the first to submit completely to Allah and to never associate anything or anyone else with Him in worship or authority. This verse establishes the core principle of Islam: absolute submission to Allah alone, which means recognizing Him as the sole ultimate authority and refraining from attributing divine qualities or rights (like ultimate sovereignty or the right to legislate) to any creature.","arabic":"قُلْ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَتَّخِذُ وَلِيًّا فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ ۗ قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ ۖ وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"Say: \"I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the penalty of a Mighty Day.","commentary":"Building on the command in the previous verse to submit solely to Allah and avoid associating partners with Him, this verse expresses the deep reverence and fear of Allah felt by the Prophet. He states that if he were to disobey Allah, his Lord, he would greatly fear the punishment of a \"Mighty Day,\" referring to the Day of Judgment. This emphasizes the seriousness of the command to submit to Allah alone and highlights the grave consequences of disobedience. It also serves as a warning to others, showing that even the Prophet, who is closest to Allah, holds the consequences of disobedience in such awe. This feeling of accountability reinforces the importance of upholding Allah's oneness and submitting to His commands.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ"},{"verse":"16","text":"\"On that day, if the penalty is averted from any, it is due to Allah's mercy; And that would be (Salvation), the obvious fulfilment of all desire.","commentary":"Following the mention of the dreadful punishment on the Day of Judgment in the previous verse, this verse offers a contrasting image: the immense mercy of Allah. It explains that if someone is spared that severe punishment on the Day of Judgment, it is purely due to Allah's mercy. This emphasizes that salvation and avoiding punishment are not solely the result of one's own actions, but are ultimately granted by Allah's grace. Being saved on that Day is described as the ultimate triumph and the fulfillment of all aspirations. This highlights the importance of seeking Allah's mercy and connects back to the declaration in Verse 12 that Allah has committed Himself to mercy, offering hope alongside the warning of accountability.","arabic":"مَنْ يُصْرَفْ عَنْهُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَقَدْ رَحِمَهُ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْمُبِينُ"},{"verse":"17","text":"\"If Allah touch thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; if He touch thee with happiness, He hath power over all things.","commentary":"This verse further elaborates on Allah's absolute power and control over all aspects of life, connecting to the idea of taking Him as the sole protector and master mentioned in Verse 14. It states that if Allah allows any hardship or affliction to befall someone, there is no one who can remove it except Him. Conversely, if Allah grants good fortune or happiness, it is also entirely within His power, as He has control over all things. This reinforces the message that ultimate power rests solely with Allah and that seeking help or fortune from others is futile. It encourages reliance on Allah alone in both times of difficulty and ease.","arabic":"وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"18","text":"\"He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers; and He is the Wise, acquainted with all things.\"","commentary":"This verse continues to describe Allah's supreme attributes, reinforcing the reasons why He alone should be taken as a master and protector. It describes Allah as \"the irresistible,\" meaning He is supreme and none can withstand His will or authority. He is also described as watching over His servants, signifying His constant awareness and oversight of all they do. Furthermore, He is stated to be \"the Wise,\" possessing perfect wisdom in all His actions and decrees, and \"acquainted with all things,\" having comprehensive knowledge of everything. These attributes further emphasize Allah's unique and unparalleled nature, solidifying the message from previous verses about the necessity of submitting to Him alone and acknowledging His sole sovereignty based on His overwhelming power, perfect wisdom, and complete knowledge.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْخَبِيرُ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Say: \"What thing is most weighty in evidence?\" Say: \"Allah is witness between me and you; This Qur'an hath been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah?\" Say: \"Nay! I cannot bear witness!\" Say: \"But in truth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him.\"","commentary":"This verse brings the passage to a powerful climax, directly addressing the core issue of Allah's oneness. It starts with a challenging question: what is the most powerful or weighty evidence? The immediate answer is that Allah Himself is the ultimate witness. The Prophet is instructed to declare that Allah is a witness to the truth between him and those who associate partners with Allah. As part of this divine testimony, the verse states that the Qur'an has been revealed to the Prophet to warn them and everyone it reaches. This means the Qur'an itself carries Allah's decisive testimony regarding His oneness. The verse then directly challenges the polytheists: can they truthfully bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah? The Prophet is commanded to definitively declare that he absolutely cannot bear such false witness. Instead, he firmly states the truth: Allah is the one and only God, and he completely dissociates himself from their practice of associating anything with Allah. This verse provides a clear and unequivocal statement of faith in Allah's absolute oneness and a decisive separation from all forms of polytheism, emphasizing that the Qur'an itself serves as the ultimate evidence revealed by Allah.","arabic":"قُلْ أَيُّ شَيْءٍ أَكْبَرُ شَهَادَةً ۖ قُلِ اللَّهُ ۖ شَهِيدٌ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ ۚ وَأُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنُ لِأُنْذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَنْ بَلَغَ ۚ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ مَعَ اللَّهِ آلِهَةً أُخْرَىٰ ۚ قُلْ لَا أَشْهَدُ ۚ قُلْ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ وَإِنَّنِي بَرِيءٌ مِمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe.","commentary":"This verse refers to people who have received Divine revelations before, meaning followers of earlier scriptures. It states that they recognize the truth of the message brought by the Prophet Muhammad, in the Qur’an, as clearly as they recognize their own children. They understand its nature as Divine revelation. However, the verse adds that some among them still refuse to believe because they have essentially chosen to harm their own spiritual selves by rejecting the truth. This verse serves to emphasize the clear nature of the truth presented in the Qur’an, suggesting that even those with prior experience of revelation can see its authenticity. It leads into the next verse by highlighting the profound wrongness of rejecting such a clear truth.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمُ ۘ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejecteth His signs? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper.","commentary":"Following the statement that the truth is clear and recognized by those familiar with revelation, this verse poses a rhetorical question: who could possibly do greater wrong than someone who invents falsehoods about Allah or rejects the clear signs He provides? It identifies such people as \"wrong-doers,\" using a term often applied in the Qur'an to those who deviate from truth and justice. The verse emphasizes that such individuals will ultimately not succeed or prosper, highlighting the serious consequences of their actions and connecting their rejection of truth to their eventual outcome, which will be further detailed in the verses that follow describing the Day of Judgment.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِهِ ۗ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those who ascribed partners (to Us): \"Where are the partners whom ye (invented and) talked about?\"","commentary":"Continuing the theme of consequences for denying Allah's truth, this verse describes a scene on the Day of Resurrection. It depicts Allah gathering all people together. Then, He will specifically address those who associated partners with Him, asking them to present the \"partners\" they claimed existed. This question highlights the ultimate helplessness and non-existence of anything or anyone they worshipped or relied upon instead of or alongside Allah in their worldly life. It sets the stage for the next verse, showing their inability to provide an answer.","arabic":"وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا أَيْنَ شُرَكَاؤُكُمُ الَّذِينَ كُنْتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"There will then be (left) no subterfuge for them but to say: \"By Allah our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with Allah.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the scene from the Day of Resurrection described in the previous verse. Faced with the overwhelming reality of the Day and the question about their supposed partners, those who associated others with Allah will have no excuse or way out. In this moment of truth and realization, they will swear by Allah, acknowledging Him as their Lord, and deny that they ever associated partners with Him. This reflects the state of shock and the stripping away of worldly deceptions they experience when confronted with the absolute reality of Allah's Oneness.","arabic":"ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَنْ قَالُوا وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the (lie) which they invented will leave them in the lurch.","commentary":"Following their denial in the previous verse, this verse points out the contradiction and tragic irony of their situation. It expresses wonder at how they are essentially lying against themselves (or lying *to* themselves) in that moment by denying what they actually did in life – associating partners with Allah. Their fabricated claims and the false partners they invented during their earthly life will abandon them on this critical Day, offering no help or support. This underscores the futility of their actions in the world and links back to the earlier warning in verse 21 that wrongdoers who lie against Allah will not prosper.","arabic":"انْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ ۚ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much that when they come to thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: \"These are nothing but tales of the ancients.\"","commentary":"Shifting back to describe the attitude of the deniers in their earthly life, this verse highlights different ways people react to the Prophet's message. Some people may appear to listen, but their hearts are veiled and their ears are deafened, preventing them from truly understanding or accepting the message. This state is described as being willed by Allah, as a consequence of their own initial choice to turn away and suppress their natural inclination towards truth. Even if they witnessed every conceivable sign, they would still not believe. This stubborn rejection manifests in their behavior when they confront the Prophet, dismissing the Qur'an as merely old stories or \"tales of the ancients.\" This illustrates the depth of their resistance, despite the clarity of the signs mentioned in earlier verses (like verse 20).","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ ۖ وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَنْ يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا ۚ وَإِنْ يَرَوْا كُلَّ آيَةٍ لَا يُؤْمِنُوا بِهَا ۚ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءُوكَ يُجَادِلُونَكَ يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا أَسَاطِيرُ الْأَوَّلِينَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they only destroy their own souls, and they perceive it not.","commentary":"Building on the description of rejection in the previous verse, this verse describes another aspect of the deniers' behavior. Besides those who listen but fail to understand, there are others who actively distance themselves from the message of the Qur'an and also prevent others from hearing or being influenced by it. They deliberately avoid it and deter others. However, the verse points out the unfortunate reality that, in doing so, they are only causing harm to themselves, leading their own spiritual selves towards ruin, even though they may not realize the true consequence of their actions in this life. This verse emphasizes the self-inflicted damage caused by rejecting Divine guidance.","arabic":"وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ ۖ وَإِنْ يُهْلِكُونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord, but would be amongst those who believe!\"","commentary":"Following the descriptions of their stubborn rejection and self-inflicted harm in this life (verses 25-26), this verse presents a dramatic scene from the Hereafter. It asks the listener to imagine the state of these deniers when they are brought face-to-face with the Fire (Hell). In this terrifying moment, confronted with the reality of their destiny, their attitude completely changes from arrogant denial to desperate regret. They express an intense wish to be sent back to earthly life, promising that if given a second chance, they would not reject Allah's signs and would instead be believers. This stark contrast highlights the severity of their eventual realization and their futile longing for a lost opportunity.","arabic":"وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُوا يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"Yea, in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the regretful wish expressed by the deniers in the previous verse. It confirms that, in that moment of confrontation with the Fire, the truth they had hidden or denied within themselves throughout their lives will become fully apparent to them. However, the verse states unequivocally that their plea to return and believe is not sincere at its core. If they were indeed sent back to life, they would revert to their forbidden behaviors and denial, because they are fundamentally untruthful about their intentions. This reveals their persistent nature and emphasizes that their remorse is a reaction to punishment, not a genuine change of heart, sealing their fate as described.","arabic":"بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يُخْفُونَ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَلَوْ رُدُّوا لَعَادُوا لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"And they (sometimes) say: \"There is nothing except our life on this earth, and never shall we be raised up again.\"","commentary":"Returning to their statements made in this worldly life, this verse quotes one of the core beliefs of those who reject faith: their denial of resurrection and the Hereafter. They assert that life is confined solely to this earthly existence and that there is no future life after death where they will be brought back to account. This declaration stands in direct opposition to the scenes of the Hereafter described in the preceding verses (27-28), highlighting the fundamental difference between their limited worldly view and the reality that awaits them, as depicted in the Qur'an. This verse sets the stage for further discussion in subsequent verses that challenge this denial and emphasize the reality and importance of the Hereafter.\n\n---","arabic":"وَقَالُوا إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: \"Is not this the truth?\" They will say: \"Yea, by our Lord!\" He will say: \"Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a scene on the Day of Judgment. It shows the situation of those who, during their life on Earth, denied the truth about Allah and the afterlife. They are brought before Allah, the Lord, and are asked directly if what they denied is now clear truth to them. Overwhelmed by the reality they are facing, they can only confirm, \"Yes, indeed, by our Lord!\" At this point, their admission comes too late to change their outcome. Allah then tells them to experience the suffering that is a consequence of their refusal to believe and accept the truth when they had the chance. This scene follows from the previous discussions about their denial of resurrection and accountability, showing the stark reality they will eventually face.","arabic":"وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۚ قَالَ أَلَيْسَ هَٰذَا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ قَالُوا بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّنَا ۚ قَالَ فَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,- until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: \"Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it\"; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear?","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the consequence of denying the meeting with Allah in the afterlife, which is a state of profound loss. Those who dismissed the idea of facing Allah for accountability will have the final moment (the Last Hour) come upon them suddenly and unexpectedly. Caught unprepared, they will cry out in regret for having neglected to consider and prepare for this reality during their lives. The verse paints a vivid picture of their situation, stating that they will be carrying their burdens – representing their sins and wrongdoings – on their backs, emphasizing how heavy and terrible these consequences are. It highlights that denying the afterlife and failing to prepare for it results in complete ruin.","arabic":"قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَتْهُمُ السَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً قَالُوا يَا حَسْرَتَنَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِيهَا وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِمْ ۚ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the home in the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand?","commentary":"Following the description of the severe consequences for those who prioritize only this worldly life and deny the next, this verse offers Allah's perspective on the true value of this life compared to the afterlife. It describes the life of this world as temporary and fleeting, likening it to \"play and amusement\" – activities that are not the ultimate purpose or reality. In contrast, it states that the dwelling in the hereafter is far better for those who are \"righteous,\" meaning those who are mindful of Allah and live their lives according to His guidance, focusing on what is right and just. The verse concludes with a question, inviting people to reflect and use their reason to grasp this fundamental truth about the comparative value of this temporary life and the eternal life to come, encouraging them to make choices aligned with this understanding.","arabic":"وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ ۖ وَلَلدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ ۗ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not thee they reject: it is the signs of Allah, which the wicked contemn.","commentary":"This verse begins by offering comfort to Prophet Muhammad, acknowledging the distress caused by the words and rejection from his people. It clarifies that their rejection is not a personal rejection of him as a truthful man, but rather a deliberate denial of the signs revealed by Allah. Many of them knew the Prophet to be honest and trustworthy, and even recognized the unique nature of the message he brought. However, due to reasons like protecting their social status, influence, or simply stubborn pride, they chose to reject Allah's signs despite understanding their truth. This verse reassures the Prophet that his truthfulness is not the issue; the problem lies with those who choose to ignore or oppose the divine signs themselves.","arabic":"قَدْ نَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُ لَيَحْزُنُكَ الَّذِي يَقُولُونَ ۖ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يُكَذِّبُونَكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.","commentary":"Building upon the previous verse's comfort, this verse provides further solace by reminding Prophet Muhammad that he is not alone in facing rejection. It points out that earlier messengers of Allah also faced similar denial, abuse, and hardship from their people. However, it emphasizes that these prophets endured with patience and steadfastness until Allah's help ultimately reached them, leading to their success in delivering the message. This highlights a consistent pattern in divine messages: challenges are faced with patience, and ultimate support comes from Allah at the time He wills, for nothing can change His decrees. It implicitly encourages the Prophet and his followers to likewise remain patient and firm.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُوا عَلَىٰ مَا كُذِّبُوا وَأُوذُوا حَتَّىٰ أَتَاهُمْ نَصْرُنَا ۚ وَلَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكَ مِنْ نَبَإِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"If their spurning is hard on thy mind, yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign,- (what good?). If it were Allah's will, He could gather them together unto true guidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance (and impatience)!","commentary":"This verse addresses the Prophet's understandable desire for his people to accept guidance, perhaps even wishing for a tangible sign that might convince them. It conveys that even if he could perform extraordinary feats, like digging deep into the earth or ascending to the heavens to bring a physical sign, it wouldn't necessarily lead to their belief. Guidance is fundamentally a matter of Allah's will and a person's receptiveness, not just seeing a miracle. If Allah had willed, He could have compelled everyone to believe, but He has granted humans the ability to choose. Therefore, the Prophet is advised not to be distressed by their rejection or impatience for a sign, but to accept Allah's way of dealing with guidance.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ أَنْ تَبْتَغِيَ نَفَقًا فِي الْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِي السَّمَاءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُمْ بِآيَةٍ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"Those who listen (in truth), be sure, will accept: as to the dead, Allah will raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him.","commentary":"Following the discussion about guidance and the ineffectiveness of forced signs in the previous verse, this verse clarifies who truly benefits from the message. It states that those who are receptive and willing to listen with an open heart will inevitably respond positively to the truth. Conversely, it describes those who reject the message as being like the \"dead\" – not physically dead, but spiritually unresponsive to the call of truth, regardless of the signs presented. Their fate is left to Allah; He alone has the power to revive them (spiritually in this life, or physically on the Day of Judgment) and ultimately all will return to Him for accountability. This emphasizes that the advocate's role is to convey the message, while the response depends on the individual's spiritual state and Allah's ultimate decree.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا يَسْتَجِيبُ الَّذِينَ يَسْمَعُونَ ۘ وَالْمَوْتَىٰ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهُ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"They say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say: \"Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the unbelievers' demand for a specific miraculous sign, picking up on the theme from Verse 35. It confirms Allah's absolute power to send down any sign they request. However, it points out that most of them do not truly understand the implications of their demand. Historically, people who demanded signs and still rejected the truth after witnessing them often faced severe consequences, including destruction. Allah, in His wisdom and mercy, may withhold such signs to give them more time and opportunity to believe through reflection on the existing signs, rather than sealing their doom. The lack of understanding on their part refers to the consequences of their persistent denial should a sign be given.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۚ قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ آيَةً وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"38","text":"There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion from Verse 37 about signs, this verse shifts the focus from demanded supernatural miracles to the profound signs already present throughout creation. It draws attention to the natural world, stating that every living creature on Earth, from animals to birds, exists in communities with their own structures and ways of life, much like human societies. This intricate order and diversity in creation are presented as powerful signs of Allah's knowledge, power, and planning. The verse emphasizes that Allah's knowledge encompasses everything, and all creatures, including humans, will ultimately be gathered back to Him for reckoning. This natural order and Allah's comprehensive knowledge are presented as a far greater and more enduring sign than the temporary miracles requested.","arabic":"وَمَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّا أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ ۚ مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb,- in the midst of darkness profound: whom Allah willeth, He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth, He placeth on the way that is straight.","commentary":"Concluding this passage, this verse describes the state of those who deny Allah's signs, whether the revealed verses or the signs in creation mentioned in the previous verse. It illustrates their spiritual condition by stating they are like those who are \"deaf and dumb,\" unable to properly hear or speak the truth, and wandering in \"profound darkness,\" unable to see the clear path of guidance. This is not a physical description, but a metaphor for their spiritual unresponsiveness and lack of comprehension due to their deliberate rejection. The verse ends by affirming that guidance and misguidance ultimately occur according to Allah's will and established law, which allows individuals to choose their path. Allah guides those who are receptive and seek guidance, and leaves to stray those who deliberately turn away from the truth, in accordance with His knowledge of their hearts and choices. This connects back to the idea in Verse 36 that only those who are receptive (\"can hear\") will respond.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا صُمٌّ وَبُكْمٌ فِي الظُّلُمَاتِ ۗ مَنْ يَشَإِ اللَّهُ يُضْلِلْهُ وَمَنْ يَشَأْ يَجْعَلْهُ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"40","text":"Say: \"Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of Allah, or the Hour (that ye dread), would ye then call upon other than Allah?- (reply) if ye are truthful!","commentary":"This verse asks a direct question to people who worship things other than Allah: If you were suddenly faced with Allah's wrath or the dreaded Hour of Judgment, would you call upon anyone other than Allah for help? It challenges them to answer honestly, based on their natural instinct. This question is posed to highlight the inherent human recognition of Allah as the ultimate power and helper, especially in times of extreme crisis.","arabic":"قُلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمُ السَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"41","text":"\"Nay,- On Him would ye call, and if it be His will, He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him, and ye would forget (the false gods) which ye join with Him!\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse's question, this verse provides the truthful answer. It affirms that in a moment of overwhelming distress, people instinctively turn to Allah alone. It explains that if it is Allah's will, He would relieve the difficulty they called upon Him about, and in that moment, they would completely forget the false deities they associated with Him. This shows how external beliefs can fall away when human nature is confronted with ultimate power, revealing the deep-seated knowledge of Allah's oneness.","arabic":"بَلْ إِيَّاهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَاءَ وَتَنْسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"42","text":"Before thee We sent (messengers) to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility.","commentary":"Moving from addressing individuals, this verse introduces a historical perspective. It explains that before Prophet Muhammad, Allah sent messengers to many nations. These nations were tested with difficulties like suffering and hardship. The purpose of these trials was to give them a chance to become humble, recognize their dependence on Allah, and turn to Him, thus learning from their situation. This sets the stage for explaining what happened when these nations did not heed the test.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِالْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"When the suffering reached them from us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them.","commentary":"This verse continues the account of previous nations mentioned in the preceding verse. It questions why, despite the suffering sent by Allah to humble them, they did not learn. Instead of turning back, their hearts became hard, resistant to the message. It explains that Satan made their wrong actions seem appealing to them, causing them to persist in their deviation rather than seeking humility before Allah.","arabic":"فَلَوْلَا إِذْ جَاءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُوا وَلَٰكِنْ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair!","commentary":"Building on the history of previous nations who ignored the warnings and hardened their hearts, this verse describes another phase of testing. When they completely disregarded the reminders they had received through suffering, Allah then gave them abundant prosperity and ease. They were allowed to enjoy all kinds of good things. However, while they were fully engrossed in their enjoyment, Allah suddenly brought His punishment upon them. This sudden turn of events plunged them into utter despair, showing that prosperity is also a test and can be withdrawn unexpectedly.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا نَسُوا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَرِحُوا بِمَا أُوتُوا أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُبْلِسُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds.","commentary":"Concluding the account of the previous nations, this verse states the final outcome: the last trace of the wrongdoers (those who rejected Allah's message and associated partners with Him) was completely eliminated. The phrase \"Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds\" is added, indicating that this outcome is a matter of justice and wisdom from Allah, who sustains and governs all creation. The eradication of those who corrupted the earth is seen as a necessary and praiseworthy act by the ultimate Lord.","arabic":"فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا ۚ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Say: \"Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?\" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.","commentary":"Shifting back to address the people directly, this verse challenges them to consider their own vulnerability and Allah's power. It asks who, other than Allah, could possibly restore their hearing, sight, or the ability of their hearts to understand, if Allah were to take these away. This highlights Allah's unique control over these fundamental human faculties and the powerlessness of anything else they might worship. The verse then expresses wonder that despite Allah presenting clear signs in many different ways, people still turn away from the truth.","arabic":"قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَارَكُمْ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ ۗ انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ ثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"Say: \"Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong?","commentary":"This verse serves as a further warning, connecting to the previous challenges about Allah's power. It asks them to consider that if Allah's punishment were to come upon them, whether unexpectedly or clearly and openly, would anyone be destroyed except those who do wrong? This clarifies that punishment is specifically for those who persist in wrongdoing and rejecting Allah's signs, reassuring those who believe and act rightly.","arabic":"قُلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ بَغْتَةً أَوْ جَهْرَةً هَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives),- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse defines the essential role of Allah's messengers, clarifying that their task is simple and clear: to bring good news to those who believe and to warn those who disbelieve. It states the consequence for the believers: those who accept the message and improve their conduct will have no fear about the future and no grief over the past or present. This offers a path to security and peace in contrast to the warnings given in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَمَا نُرْسِلُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ ۖ فَمَنْ آمَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"But those who reject our signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the fate of believers (mentioned in the previous verse) with that of those who reject Allah's signs and messages brought by the messengers. It states that those who deny the signs will face punishment because they continued to transgress and disobey. This clearly outlines the two possible outcomes based on how people respond to the message delivered by the messengers, serving as a final warning within this passage.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ الْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"Say: \"I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.\" Say: \"can the blind be held equal to the seeing?\" Will ye then consider not?","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing common misunderstandings people had about the nature and role of a prophet in earlier times. Prophet Muhammad, as commanded by Allah, clarifies that he does not possess Allah's physical treasures or wealth, nor does he have access to knowledge of the unseen future or hidden things that only Allah knows. He also states clearly that he is not an angel, but a human being. His sole function is to follow and convey what Allah reveals to him. The verse then asks a profound question: can someone who is spiritually blind, lacking guidance, be considered equal to someone who can see clearly with the light of divine guidance? This question encourages reflection on the fundamental difference between accepting the truth guided by revelation and rejecting it out of ignorance or stubbornness.","arabic":"قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ ۖ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ ۚ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الْأَعْمَىٰ وَالْبَصِيرُ ۚ أَفَلَا تَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).","commentary":"Following the call to reflection in the previous verse, this verse instructs Prophet Muhammad to deliver a specific warning. This warning is directed towards those who have a sense of accountability and fear the reality of standing before their Lord, Allah, for judgment in the afterlife. It emphasizes that on that day, there will be no one to protect them or intercede for them without Allah's permission. The purpose of this warning is not to instill despair, but to motivate people to be mindful of Allah (to be God-fearing) and to guard themselves against actions that would lead to negative consequences in the hereafter. It connects to the previous verse by highlighting the importance of spiritual sight – seeing the reality of the afterlife and judgment.","arabic":"وَأَنْذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَنْ يُحْشَرُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۙ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلَا شَفِيعٌ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are they accountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be (one) of the unjust.","commentary":"This verse addresses a situation where some prominent figures in society asked Prophet Muhammad to distance himself from his humbler followers, implying they were not worthy of his company due to their social status or lack of wealth. The verse gives a clear instruction: do not turn away those who are sincere in their devotion, calling upon Allah morning and evening, seeking only His pleasure. It asserts the principle of individual accountability before Allah – each person is responsible for their own actions, regardless of their social standing or association with others. To dismiss sincere believers based on worldly criteria would be an act of injustice. This verse reinforces the core Islamic value that a person's worth is measured by their sincerity and connection with Allah, not by their wealth or social position, linking back to the concept of spiritual sight and accountability discussed in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَلَا تَطْرُدِ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ ۖ مَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ وَمَا مِنْ حِسَابِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَتَطْرُدَهُمْ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: \"Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us?\" Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful?","commentary":"This verse explains that the situation described in the previous verse – the presence of sincere, humble believers alongside the Prophet, which was questioned by some wealthy or prominent individuals – was a deliberate test from Allah. It reveals the inner thoughts of those who were tested: they looked down on the humbler followers and wondered why Allah would favor *them* with guidance over individuals of higher social standing. The verse then provides Allah's perfect response: Allah knows best who is truly grateful for His blessings, including the blessing of guidance. This highlights that Allah's favor is based on inner sincerity and gratitude, not outward appearances or social status, directly addressing the arrogance shown towards the humble believers mentioned in verse 52.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِيَقُولُوا أَهَٰؤُلَاءِ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ بَيْنِنَا ۗ أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِالشَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: \"Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the emphasis on true worth being based on gratitude and faith in verses 52 and 53, this verse instructs Prophet Muhammad on how to receive those who believe in Allah's revelations. He is commanded to greet them with \"Peace be upon you,\" signifying a bond of tranquility and respect. The verse then delivers a core message of hope: Allah has committed Himself to mercy. It explains that if someone commits a bad deed, perhaps out of human weakness or lack of full understanding at the time (\"ignorance\"), but then sincerely repents and changes their behavior for the better, Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. This underscores the boundless nature of Allah's mercy for those who turn back to Him, reinforcing the value and reward of faith and repentance that humble believers exemplify.","arabic":"وَإِذَا جَاءَكَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا فَقُلْ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ ۖ أَنَّهُ مَنْ عَمِلَ مِنْكُمْ سُوءًا بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَنَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"55","text":"Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding statement for the preceding passage and links back to the detailed explanations provided throughout the Sura. It declares that Allah clarifies His signs and messages in detail. The purpose of this clarity is not only to illuminate the path of guidance for believers but also to make the path of those who deliberately choose to sin and disobey Allah distinctly clear. By presenting truth and falsehood in sharp contrast, Allah ensures that people can make informed choices. This connects to the theme of spiritual sight versus blindness mentioned in verse 50, emphasizing that Allah provides the clear vision through His revelation, leaving no room for ambiguity about the consequences of following either the path of righteousness or the path of deviation.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ سَبِيلُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Say: \"I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon.\" Say: \"I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a section that clarifies the unique nature of Allah and the role of the Messenger. The Prophet is instructed to clearly state that he is forbidden from worshipping anything or anyone other than Allah, whom others might call upon or consider partners with Allah. He must also declare that he will not follow the desires or preferences of those who oppose this truth. Doing so would lead him away from the right path and separate him from those who are rightly guided. This sets a clear boundary between the Prophet's message of monotheism and the practices of associating others with Allah.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنِّي نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ قُلْ لَا أَتَّبِعُ أَهْوَاءَكُمْ ۙ قَدْ ضَلَلْتُ إِذًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"Say: \"For me, I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges.\"","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's clear declaration, the Prophet is instructed to affirm that his message and actions are based on clear evidence from his Lord, Allah, even though his audience rejects this truth. He must also clarify that things they might impatiently demand, such as immediate miracles or punishments, are not within his ability to bring about. The authority and decision-making power belong solely to Allah. Allah is the one who reveals the truth and is the ultimate judge, settling all matters justly. This emphasizes the distinction between the Messenger, who conveys the message, and Allah, the ultimate authority and controller of all things.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنِّي عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّي وَكَذَّبْتُمْ بِهِ ۚ مَا عِنْدِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ ۚ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۖ يَقُصُّ الْحَقَّ ۖ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْفَاصِلِينَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"Say: \"If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong.\"","commentary":"This verse further reinforces the point made in Verse 57 regarding the Prophet's lack of control over hastening events like miracles or punishments. The Prophet is instructed to say that if he *could* bring about what they impatiently demand, the matter between him and them would have been settled quickly. However, such power rests only with Allah. Allah, in His wisdom, knows best who the wrongdoers are and when and how to deal with them. This highlights Allah's patience and forbearance compared to human impatience, even when faced with stubborn denial.","arabic":"قُلْ لَوْ أَنَّ عِنْدِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ لَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).","commentary":"Building upon the assertion of Allah's ultimate authority and knowledge in the previous verses, this verse describes the immense scope of Allah's knowledge. It states that the keys to everything that is beyond human perception belong exclusively to Allah; no one else knows them. His knowledge encompasses everything that exists on land and in the sea. It is so comprehensive that not even a single leaf falls without His knowledge, nor is there a seed hidden in the deepest parts of the earth, nor anything, living or non-living, wet or dry, that is not known to Him and recorded in a clear way. This verse illustrates the absolute, detailed, and all-encompassing nature of Allah's knowledge over the entire universe, both the seen and the unseen.","arabic":"وَعِنْدَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِنْ وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"60","text":"It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.","commentary":"Following the description of Allah's infinite knowledge (Verse 59), this verse shifts focus to His control over human life. It explains that it is Allah who causes people to be in a state like death when they sleep at night, while He is fully aware of everything they did during the day. He then restores them to wakefulness each day so that they may complete the lifespan appointed for them. Ultimately, everyone will return to Him, and He will reveal the truth of all their actions. This verse connects the daily cycle of sleep and waking to the larger cycle of life, death, and eventual return to Allah for accountability, demonstrating His continuous power and knowledge over human existence.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ بِاللَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُمْ بِالنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ لِيُقْضَىٰ أَجَلٌ مُسَمًّى ۖ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"61","text":"He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of Allah's power and control (from Verse 60), this verse highlights Allah's supreme authority over His creation. It states that He is the One who holds ultimate power over His servants and is constantly watching over them. He appoints guardians (often understood as angels) to oversee and protect individuals during their lives. When the appointed time of death arrives for a person, angels sent by Allah cause their soul to be taken, and they carry out this duty precisely and without fail. This emphasizes Allah's inescapable power and the precise operation of His will through His appointed agents.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ ۖ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُمْ حَفَظَةً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لَا يُفَرِّطُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the (only) reality: Is not His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account.","commentary":"Following the description of death in Verse 61, this verse speaks about what happens next: people are returned to Allah. It affirms that Allah is their true Protector and the ultimate Reality, the only one deserving of this status. It poses a rhetorical question, \"Is not His the command?\", emphasizing that all authority and decision-making belong to Him. The verse concludes by stating that He is the swiftest in taking account of everyone's deeds. This reinforces the transition from worldly life to the accountability before Allah, linking His absolute authority to the final judgment.","arabic":"ثُمَّ رُدُّوا إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَاهُمُ الْحَقِّ ۚ أَلَا لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَاسِبِينَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"Say: \"Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea, when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror: 'If He only delivers us from these (dangers), (we vow) we shall truly show our gratitude'?\"","commentary":"Shifting from the concepts of death and return to Allah (Verse 62), this verse prompts reflection on human nature during times of extreme difficulty. The Prophet is instructed to ask people who it is that saves them from grave dangers and darkness on land and at sea. It describes how, in such moments of humility and fear, people call upon Allah alone, often making sincere promises to be grateful if saved. This points to an innate human recognition of a higher power to whom they turn when all other help fails.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِنْ ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً لَئِنْ أَنْجَانَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"Say \"It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all (other) distresses: and yet ye worship false gods!\"","commentary":"Following up on the previous verse's description of turning to Allah in distress (Verse 63), this verse provides the direct answer and points out a contradiction in human behavior. The Prophet is commanded to state clearly that it is indeed Allah who saves them from such dangers and from all other forms of hardship and distress. However, the verse immediately contrasts this reality with their actions during times of ease, noting that despite experiencing Allah's deliverance, they still associate others with Him in worship. This highlights the inconsistency of turning to Allah only in times of need while attributing divine power or offering worship to others when safe.","arabic":"قُلِ اللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِنْهَا وَمِنْ كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"Say: \"He hath power to send calamities on you, from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other.\" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); that they may understand.","commentary":"Concluding this section (and linking back to Allah's power mentioned earlier), this verse reminds people of Allah's continued ability to send challenges and trials. The Prophet is instructed to state that Allah has the power to send suffering from any direction – from above or from beneath – emphasizing His absolute control over events. It also mentions another type of trial: causing disunity and conflict among people, leading to internal strife where groups experience harm from one another. This is presented as a way Allah makes His signs clear through various examples, so that people might understand His power and the consequences of deviating from His guidance.","arabic":"قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابًا مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِنْ تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعًا وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ۗ انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"But thy people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: \"Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs;","commentary":"This verse begins by addressing Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), acknowledging that his own people are rejecting the message he has brought, even though it is the truth revealed by Allah. It instructs the Prophet to tell them that he is not responsible for their choices or how they manage their affairs. His role is to deliver the message, but their decision to accept or reject it rests solely with them. This sets the stage for the following verses, which further clarify the separation and consequences that arise from such choices.","arabic":"وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ ۚ قُلْ لَسْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ"},{"verse":"67","text":"For every message is a limit of time, and soon shall ye know it.\"","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse, which established the Prophet's lack of responsibility for those who reject the truth, this verse delivers a subtle warning. It informs those who are rejecting the message that everything has a set time or outcome, and they will eventually come to realize the consequences of their actions. This implies a future point when the truth of the message and the result of their rejection will become clear to them.","arabic":"لِكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُسْتَقَرٌّ ۚ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes thee forget, then after recollection, sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong.","commentary":"Building on the theme of encountering rejection and disrespect, this verse provides specific guidance to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and by extension to Muslims, on how to act when faced with people who speak disrespectfully or mockingly about Allah's signs or revelations. It instructs them to turn away and leave the company of such people unless the conversation changes to something else. It adds that if one happens to forget this instruction and sits with them, they should leave immediately upon remembering. This emphasizes the importance of showing respect for divine messages and avoiding environments where they are treated lightly. This guidance clarifies the practical response to the situation described in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِي آيَاتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ ۚ وَإِمَّا يُنْسِيَنَّكَ الشَّيْطَانُ فَلَا تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ الذِّكْرَىٰ مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous, but (their duty) is to remind them, that they may (learn to) fear Allah.","commentary":"This verse further defines the relationship between those who are righteous (believers who strive to live according to Allah's guidance) and those who reject the message or act wrongly. It states clearly that the righteous bear no responsibility for the actions or fate of these individuals. Their duty towards them is limited to reminding them of the truth and warning them, with the hope that they might become mindful of Allah and their accountability to Him. This reinforces the distinction between the two groups, while still upholding the importance of conveying the message. It connects to the previous verses by clarifying the extent of the righteous person's obligation towards those who reject the truth.","arabic":"وَمَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ وَلَٰكِنْ ذِكْرَىٰ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim (to them) this (truth): that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts: it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom, (or reparation), none will be accepted: such is (the end of) those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boiling water, and for punishment, one most grievous: for they persisted in rejecting Allah.","commentary":"Concluding this section, this verse provides a strong instruction regarding those who treat their faith or spiritual matters as insignificant, being misled by the attractions of worldly life. It commands to distance oneself from them. However, it immediately follows this by directing that a crucial truth must be proclaimed to them: that each person is responsible for their own deeds and their consequences. It emphasizes that on the Day of Judgment, no one will be able to protect them from Allah, no one can intercede on their behalf without Allah's permission, and no amount of compensation or ransom will be accepted. The verse vividly describes the severe punishment awaiting those who, through their own actions of persistent rejection and treating matters of faith lightly, have brought ruin upon themselves, including boiling water to drink and intense suffering. This verse acts as a powerful final warning in this passage, reiterating the ultimate separation and severe consequences for those who deliberately turn away from Allah's truth and disrespect His signs, connecting directly back to the themes of rejection and responsibility introduced in the earlier verses.","arabic":"وَذَرِ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا دِينَهُمْ لَعِبًا وَلَهْوًا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا ۚ وَذَكِّرْ بِهِ أَنْ تُبْسَلَ نَفْسٌ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ لَيْسَ لَهَا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلَا شَفِيعٌ وَإِنْ تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ لَا يُؤْخَذْ مِنْهَا ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ أُبْسِلُوا بِمَا كَسَبُوا ۖ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"Say: \"Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah,- things that can do us neither good nor harm,- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah? - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling, come to us', (vainly) guiding him to the path.\" Say: \"Allah's guidance is the (only) guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds;-","commentary":"This verse begins with a question posed to those who choose to worship or seek help from anything other than Allah. It asks whether it makes sense to turn away from the guidance of Allah, who alone has the power to benefit or harm, and instead rely on things that are utterly powerless.\n\nThe verse then uses a powerful analogy to describe the state of someone who rejects Allah's guidance after having received it. It compares them to a person lost and confused, having been led astray by evil influences. This individual stumbles aimlessly, bewildered by their surroundings, while their companions who follow the right path desperately call out to them, urging them to come back. This imagery highlights the confusion and misery that results from abandoning truth for falsehood.\n\nThe verse concludes by declaring a fundamental truth: Allah's guidance is the only true guidance. As Muslims, we are commanded to fully submit ourselves to Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all the worlds, acknowledging His sole authority and wisdom.","arabic":"قُلْ أَنَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنْفَعُنَا وَلَا يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ كَالَّذِي اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فِي الْأَرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَابٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى الْهُدَى ائْتِنَا ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ ۖ وَأُمِرْنَا لِنُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"\"To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah: for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together.\"","commentary":"Following the declaration in the previous verse about submitting to the Lord of all the worlds, this verse specifies some key actions and attitudes that are part of this submission. It instructs us to establish regular prayers, which are a direct connection and form of worship offered solely to Allah. It also instructs us to \"fear Allah,\" which in Islamic context means being mindful of Him, having reverence, and being conscious of our accountability to Him in all our actions.\n\nThe verse then explains the ultimate reason for these commands: it is to Allah that all of us will eventually be gathered. This reminder of the Day of Judgment, when everyone will return to their Creator, serves as a powerful motivation to live a life of submission, righteousness, and conscious awareness of Allah, preparing for that inevitable gathering.","arabic":"وَأَنْ أَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَاتَّقُوهُ ۚ وَهُوَ الَّذِي إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): the day He saith, \"Be,\" behold! it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the unseen as well as that which is open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted (with all things).","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the immense power and unique attributes of Allah, further reinforcing why He alone is deserving of worship and submission, as mentioned in the preceding verses. It states that Allah is the One who created the vast heavens and the earth, and that He did so \"in truth,\" implying a purposeful and real creation, not an illusion.\n\nThe verse highlights His absolute power and the ease with which He creates; He merely says \"Be,\" and it comes into existence. It emphasizes that His word is always the truth – whether it is His command for creation, His guidance for humanity, or His descriptions of what is to come.\n\nIt then reminds us of the Day of Judgment, stating that on the day when the trumpet is blown (a sign of the Resurrection), all power and authority will be solely His. This reinforces the point made in verse 72 that we will all be gathered to Him. Finally, the verse concludes by affirming Allah's perfect knowledge – He knows everything, seen and unseen – and His perfect wisdom in all He does. These attributes demonstrate His complete control and authority, making submission to Him the most logical and beneficial course of action for humanity.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ ۚ قَوْلُهُ الْحَقُّ ۚ وَلَهُ الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَ يُنْفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ ۚ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْخَبِيرُ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar: \"Takest thou idols for gods? For I see thee and thy people in manifest error.\"","commentary":"This verse introduces Prophet Abraham, who questions his father and his community about their practice of worshipping idols. From a Muslim perspective, this shows a pure human nature instinctively rejecting the idea of idols as deities. Prophet Abraham sees this practice as clearly misguided and expresses this view directly to his father, even though challenging one's father is a serious matter. This highlights that in matters of faith, acknowledging the truth about Allah is the highest priority, even above social customs or family ties. This verse sets the stage for Prophet Abraham's journey of seeking the true Allah.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ آزَرَ أَتَتَّخِذُ أَصْنَامًا آلِهَةً ۖ إِنِّي أَرَاكَ وَقَوْمَكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"75","text":"So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might (with understanding) have certitude.","commentary":"Following Prophet Abraham's demonstration of a sincere heart that rejects falsehood and seeks the truth (as shown in the previous verse), Allah granted him a special insight into the vast universe and the divine order within it. This wasn't just casual observation but a deeper understanding intended to strengthen his belief and lead him from an instinctive sense of truth to a conscious and certain knowledge of Allah. This divine guidance prepares him for the reflections described in the following verses.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُرِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَلِيَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُوقِنِينَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"When the night covered him over, He saw a star: He said: \"This is my Lord.\" But when it set, He said: \"I love not those that set.\"","commentary":"This verse describes Prophet Abraham's observation of a star during the night. In his sincere search for the true deity, and perhaps aware that his people also worshipped celestial bodies, he considers the bright star. However, when it sets, he realizes that something which disappears and is not always present cannot be the ultimate, ever-present Lord he seeks. His pure nature instinctively feels a connection of love towards the true Lord, and he declares that he does not love things that vanish. This rejection of the star as divine leads him to continue his search, moving to observe the moon next.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ اللَّيْلُ رَأَىٰ كَوْكَبًا ۖ قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّي ۖ فَلَمَّا أَفَلَ قَالَ لَا أُحِبُّ الْآفِلِينَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"When he saw the moon rising in splendour, he said: \"This is my Lord.\" But when the moon set, He said: \"unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be among those who go astray.\"","commentary":"Prophet Abraham then observes the rising moon, which is larger and brighter than a star, and again considers if this might be the Lord he seeks. But like the star, the moon also sets. This confirms his earlier realization that a true deity must be constantly present and unchanging. At this point, Prophet Abraham recognizes his need for divine help to find the truth, expressing his dependence on Allah's guidance lest he remain among those who are lost. This plea for guidance underscores his sincere search before moving on to consider the sun, the most prominent celestial body.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا رَأَى الْقَمَرَ بَازِغًا قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّي ۖ فَلَمَّا أَفَلَ قَالَ لَئِنْ لَمْ يَهْدِنِي رَبِّي لَأَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الضَّالِّينَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"When he saw the sun rising in splendour, he said: \"This is my Lord; this is the greatest (of all).\" But when the sun set, he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partners to Allah.","commentary":"Continuing his journey of discovery, Prophet Abraham observes the sun rising. It is the largest and brightest of the celestial bodies, leading him to consider it might be the greatest power, perhaps even the Lord. However, when the sun also sets, the truth becomes clear. He realizes that none of these transient, created things can be the true, ever-present Creator. At this decisive moment, his search culminates in the conscious recognition of Allah. He then turns to his people and firmly declares that he rejects their practice of associating partners with Allah.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا رَأَى الشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّي هَٰذَا أَكْبَرُ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَفَلَتْ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ إِنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"\"For me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah.\"","commentary":"Following the realization reached in the previous verse, Prophet Abraham makes a clear and unwavering declaration of his faith. He states that he has turned completely and sincerely towards the One who created everything in the heavens and the earth. This is a definitive statement of surrendering himself entirely to the Creator and a complete rejection of associating any partners or intermediaries with Allah in worship or obedience. This declaration sets the stage for the arguments and discussions he will have with his people about their beliefs.","arabic":"إِنِّي وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا ۖ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"His people disputed with him. He said: \"(Come) ye to dispute with me, about Allah, when He (Himself) hath guided me? I fear not (the beings) ye associate with Allah: Unless my Lord willeth, (nothing can happen). My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things. Will ye not (yourselves) be admonished?","commentary":"As expected after his bold declaration, Prophet Abraham's people began to argue with him about his faith in Allah alone and tried to instill fear in him regarding their idols. Prophet Abraham confronts their arguments with confidence, stating that Allah Himself has guided him, implying that his understanding comes from a higher source, not mere personal opinion. He asserts that he has no fear of the false deities they worship, emphasizing that nothing can happen except by the will and all-encompassing knowledge of Allah. He challenges them to reflect on this truth. This leads directly to his follow-up question about security in the next verse.","arabic":"وَحَاجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ ۚ قَالَ أَتُحَاجُّونِّي فِي اللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ ۚ وَلَا أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَاءَ رَبِّي شَيْئًا ۗ وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا ۗ أَفَلَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"\"How should I fear (the beings) ye associate with Allah, when ye fear not to give partners to Allah without any warrant having been given to you? Which of (us) two parties hath more right to security? (tell me) if ye know.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, Prophet Abraham poses a powerful question to his people. He highlights the illogical nature of their fear of powerless idols while they show no fear in associating partners with the Almighty Allah, for which they have no evidence or justification. He asks them, if they truly know anything, which of the two groups – those who believe in Allah alone or those who worship others alongside Allah – has a greater right to feel secure from harm? This is a direct challenge to their understanding and sets up the divine answer that follows.","arabic":"وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَا أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلَا تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا ۚ فَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"\"It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong - that are (truly) in security, for they are on (right) guidance.\"","commentary":"This verse provides the clear, divine answer to Prophet Abraham's question posed in the previous verse. It states that real security and true guidance belong to those who believe in Allah sincerely and do not taint their faith with any form of 'wrongdoing'. The commentary explains that in this context, the gravest form of 'wrongdoing' refers to associating partners with Allah – whether by worshipping idols, celestial bodies, or anything else alongside Him, or obeying created beings in matters that belong solely to Allah's authority. Those who maintain pure faith in Allah alone are the ones who live in security and are on the straight path.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ الْأَمْنُ وَهُمْ مُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"That was the reasoning about Us, which We gave to Abraham (to use) against his people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.","commentary":"This verse summarizes the powerful arguments and insights that Allah granted Prophet Abraham, enabling him to effectively challenge his people's false beliefs. It emphasizes that the logic and clarity Abraham used were a form of divine inspiration and guidance provided by Allah. The verse then states that Allah raises individuals in status and understanding, degree by degree, as He wills. This elevation is based on Allah's perfect wisdom and knowledge, highlighting that divine favor and true standing come from acknowledging and following His truth, as demonstrated by Prophet Abraham.","arabic":"وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا آتَيْنَاهَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ ۚ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"84","text":"We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: thus do We reward those who do good:","commentary":"This verse begins a section listing many of the prophets sent by Allah throughout history. It starts by mentioning Prophet Abraham, to whom Allah gave descendants like Prophet Isaac and Prophet Jacob, and states that all three were guided. It then broadens the scope to include Prophet Noah, who came before Prophet Abraham, and other prophets from Abraham's lineage, such as Prophet David, Prophet Solomon, Prophet Job, Prophet Joseph, Prophet Moses, and Prophet Aaron. The verse highlights that guidance is a reward from Allah for those who strive to do good. This verse sets the stage for showing the continuity of divine guidance through various prophets over time.","arabic":"وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ كُلًّا هَدَيْنَا ۚ وَنُوحًا هَدَيْنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of the righteous:","commentary":"Continuing the list of prophets, this verse mentions Prophet Zachariah, Prophet John, Prophet Jesus, and Prophet Elijah. It describes them all as being among the righteous servants of Allah. This continues the theme from the previous verse, showing a long line of individuals chosen by Allah who lived lives dedicated to righteousness and divine guidance.","arabic":"وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَإِلْيَاسَ ۖ كُلٌّ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"And Isma'il and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot: and to all We gave favour above the nations:","commentary":"This verse adds more prophets to the list, including Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Elisha, Prophet Jonah, and Prophet Lot. It emphasizes that Allah favored all these prophets above their respective nations. This further reinforces the special status and role of these individuals in conveying Allah's message and guidance to humanity, building upon the list presented in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطًا ۚ وَكُلًّا فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"(To them) and to their fathers, and progeny and brethren: We chose them, and we guided them to a straight way.","commentary":"This verse summarizes the status of the prophets mentioned in the previous verses (84-86), and expands it to include some of their families – their fathers, descendants, and relatives who also followed the path of righteousness. It states clearly that Allah chose them and guided them to a straight way. This highlights that divine guidance is something bestowed by Allah upon those He chooses, and sets the stage for explaining the nature of this guidance in the following verses.","arabic":"وَمِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَانِهِمْ ۖ وَاجْتَبَيْنَاهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"88","text":"This is the guidance of Allah: He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth, of His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all that they did would be vain for them.","commentary":"Following the list of prophets who received guidance (verses 84-87), this verse identifies the source of that guidance as solely from Allah. It states that Allah grants this guidance to whomever He wills among His servants. The verse then issues a strong warning: if these guided individuals were to associate any partners with Allah (in worship or in attributing divine power), all their deeds would become meaningless or wasted. This establishes the absolute necessity of dedicating worship and allegiance to Allah alone, connecting the concept of divine guidance to the fundamental principle of worshipping Allah without partners.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۚ وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"These were the men to whom We gave the Book, and authority, and prophethood: if these (their descendants) reject them, Behold! We shall entrust their charge to a new people who reject them not.","commentary":"Building on the preceding verses that listed the prophets and stated they were guided, this verse clarifies that these individuals were specifically chosen by Allah and entrusted with important roles. It states that Allah gave them divine scriptures (the Book), authority (or wisdom), and prophethood. The verse then delivers a powerful message: if the people of the time who inherited the legacy of these prophets reject the truth they brought, Allah is fully capable of entrusting this divine guidance to a new group of people who will accept and uphold it. This emphasizes the continuity and resilience of Allah's message, independent of the acceptance or rejection by any particular group.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ ۚ فَإِنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهَا هَٰؤُلَاءِ فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْمًا لَيْسُوا بِهَا بِكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"Those were the (prophets) who received Allah's guidance: Copy the guidance they received; Say: \"No reward for this do I ask of you: This is no less than a message for the nations.\"","commentary":"This verse concludes the section about the procession of prophets (verses 84-89). It reiterates that these were the individuals who received guidance from Allah. It then instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and, by extension, all who follow him, to emulate the guidance these prophets received. The verse also instructs the Prophet to tell people that he asks for no personal reward for conveying this message. It is not for profit or personal gain, but is simply a message from Allah intended for all humanity, for all nations, across all time. This links the historical tradition of prophethood to the final message delivered by Prophet Muhammad, presenting it as the culmination of the same divine guidance.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ ۖ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ ۗ قُلْ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا ۖ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: \"Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)\" Say: \"Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought?- a light and guidance to man: But ye make it into (separate) sheets for show, while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not- neither ye nor your fathers.\" Say: \"Allah (sent it down)\": Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.","commentary":"Following the discussion of prophets receiving guidance and scriptures (verses 84-90), this verse addresses those who deny that Allah sends any revelation to human beings. It states that such a claim indicates they do not have a proper understanding or appreciation of Allah's nature and wisdom. It challenges them by asking who sent down the Book (the Torah) brought by Prophet Moses, which was a source of light and guidance for people. The verse notes that some people distorted this scripture, displaying only parts of it while hiding much of its content, despite it having taught them knowledge they and their ancestors did not possess. The response to the question \"Who then sent it down?\" is given immediately by divine command: Say, \"Allah.\" The verse then instructs the Prophet to disregard their further arguments, describing them as pointless and trivial, emphasizing the clear truth of divine revelation.","arabic":"وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُوا مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۗ قُلْ مَنْ أَنْزَلَ الْكِتَابَ الَّذِي جَاءَ بِهِ مُوسَىٰ نُورًا وَهُدًى لِلنَّاسِ ۖ تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيرًا ۖ وَعُلِّمْتُمْ مَا لَمْ تَعْلَمُوا أَنْتُمْ وَلَا آبَاؤُكُمْ ۖ قُلِ اللَّهُ ۖ ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِي خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"And this is a Book which We have sent down, bringing blessings, and confirming (the revelations) which came before it: that thou mayest warn the mother of cities and all around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this (Book), and they are constant in guarding their prayers.","commentary":"After addressing the denial of divine revelation in general (Verse 91), this verse speaks about the Qur'an specifically. It describes the Qur'an as a blessed Book sent down by Allah, which confirms the truths found in previous divine revelations. Its purpose is for the Prophet to warn the people of Makkah (referred to as the \"Mother of Cities\") and all the regions around it. The verse highlights that belief in the Hereafter (the life after death and accountability for deeds) naturally leads people to believe in the Qur'an. Furthermore, those who believe in the Hereafter and the Qur'an are characterized by their commitment to prayer, maintaining their connection with Allah. This verse connects faith in the Hereafter and prayer to acceptance of the Qur'an and its role in continuing the tradition of divine guidance and warning.","arabic":"وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُصَدِّقُ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلِتُنْذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا ۚ وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْآخِرَةِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ ۖ وَهُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith, \"I have received inspiration,\" when he hath received none, or (again) who saith, \"I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed\"? If thou couldst but see how the wicked (do fare) in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying),\"Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive your reward,- a penalty of shame, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully to reject of His signs!\"","commentary":"This verse follows the discussion about divine revelation, highlighting the great wickedness of those who fabricate lies about Allah. This includes falsely claiming to receive divine inspiration or claiming that they can produce scripture similar to what Allah has revealed. The verse paints a vivid and stern picture of what happens to such wrongdoers at the moment of death. It describes them facing confusion and distress, with angels reaching out to take their souls, announcing their punishment. They are told that on that day, they will receive a humiliating penalty as a consequence of their lies against Allah and their arrogant rejection of His signs. This serves as a strong warning against denying or distorting the truth of divine revelation.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ قَالَ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إِلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ وَمَنْ قَالَ سَأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ۗ وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذِ الظَّالِمُونَ فِي غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ بَاسِطُو أَيْدِيهِمْ أَخْرِجُوا أَنْفُسَكُمُ ۖ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنْتُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"\"And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: ye have left behind you all (the favours) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!\"","commentary":"Continuing the powerful scene from the previous verse, which described those who fabricated falsehoods about Allah and denied His revelations, this verse depicts their state at the moment of death and when they stand before Allah. It addresses these individuals directly, emphasizing that they have returned to Allah alone and stripped of everything they possessed in worldly life.\n\nYou are told that you have come back to Allah just as you were first created – individual, naked, and helpless. Everything you enjoyed and were given in this world, such as wealth, family, status, and power, has been left behind. You could not bring any of it with you.\n\nFurthermore, you are told that the beings you used to claim were partners with Allah or would intercede for you are nowhere to be seen. You had placed your trust in them, believing they had a share in your affairs or could help you when needed. Now, all connections and ties between you and them are severed. Everything you asserted and believed in, all your false hopes and reliance on others besides Allah, have failed you completely at this critical moment. This verse serves as a stark warning about the reality of standing before Allah with only your deeds, without any worldly support or false intermediaries.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَىٰ كَمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَا خَوَّلْنَاكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ ۖ وَمَا نَرَىٰ مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَاءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَاءُ ۚ لَقَدْ تَقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْكُمْ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ"},{"verse":"105","text":"Thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say, \"Thou hast taught (us) diligently,\" and that We may make the matter clear to those who know.","commentary":"This verse explains that Allah presents His messages and signs in the Qur'an in many different ways. This is done so that people may understand clearly. However, it also highlights that the way people react depends on their readiness to accept the truth. Some people who are open to understanding and seeking knowledge will find clarity in these signs. Others, who are inclined to reject the message, might react by making dismissive claims, like alleging that the Prophet was taught by human sources, in an attempt to explain away the divine nature of the revelation. This shows how the same message leads to different outcomes based on a person's disposition.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ وَلِيَقُولُوا دَرَسْتَ وَلِنُبَيِّنَهُ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"106","text":"Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord: there is no god but He: and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah.","commentary":"Following from the previous verse, which discussed how Allah reveals His signs, this verse directly addresses the Prophet and, by extension, all believers. It is a command to adhere firmly to the divine message revealed by Allah. The core of this message is reiterated: there is no deity truly worthy of worship except Allah. Believers are instructed to focus on this fundamental truth and distance themselves from the ways of those who choose to worship other things or beings alongside Allah. This sets a clear direction for the believer's life and priorities.","arabic":"اتَّبِعْ مَا أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"107","text":"If it had been Allah's plan, they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings, nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the nature of human choice and accountability. It explains that Allah, in His wisdom, has given humans the ability to choose between following guidance and going astray. If Allah had willed to compel everyone to believe, they would not be able to worship anything other than Him. However, He has granted humans a measure of freedom for testing. The verse also reinforces the message from the previous one, reminding the Prophet (and those who convey the message) that their role is to deliver the revelation, not to force anyone to believe or to be responsible for their choices or actions. Each individual is accountable for their own decisions.","arabic":"وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكُوا ۗ وَمَا جَعَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا ۖ وَمَا أَنْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِوَكِيلٍ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.","commentary":"This verse provides guidance on the respectful conduct of believers, even when disagreeing with others' beliefs. Muslims are instructed not to insult or speak harshly about the deities or objects of worship of those who associate partners with Allah. The reason given is a wise one: doing so might provoke them to retaliate by insulting Allah in their ignorance, not truly understanding His unique status and majesty. This verse also touches on human nature, noting that people often see their own actions and beliefs as good or desirable. Ultimately, it reminds everyone that they will return to Allah, and He will reveal the truth about all that they did, implying accountability for choices made. This follows the previous verses' theme of individual responsibility and the limits of others' roles in guiding people.","arabic":"وَلَا تَسُبُّوا الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ فَيَسُبُّوا اللَّهَ عَدْوًا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ زَيَّنَّا لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ عَمَلَهُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"109","text":"They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if a (special) sign came to them, by it they would believe. Say: \"Certainly (all) signs are in the power of Allah: but what will make you (Muslims) realise that (even) if (special) signs came, they will not believe.\"?","commentary":"This verse addresses the demand for specific, extraordinary miracles as a condition for belief. It describes how some people would make solemn promises, swearing by Allah, that if they were shown a particular sign, they would certainly believe. The response reveals two important points. Firstly, it affirms that the power to display any sign rests solely with Allah. Secondly, it conveys an insight: the issue is not a lack of signs (as the universe and the Qur'an are full of them), but rather the disposition of the hearts of those making the demand. It indicates that their refusal to believe stems from something deeper than a need for evidence, implying that even if a specific, requested miracle were shown, they might still not believe due to their internal resistance. This sets the stage for the following verses which delve into the consequence of this persistent rejection.","arabic":"وَأَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِنْ جَاءَتْهُمْ آيَةٌ لَيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا ۚ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ أَنَّهَا إِذَا جَاءَتْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"110","text":"We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes, even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, this explains *why* those who demand specific signs might still not believe even if they were shown. It indicates that, as a consequence of their initial choice to reject the truth when it first came to them through the existing clear signs (like those in creation and the revelation), Allah may cause their hearts and eyes to be turned away. This can lead to confusion and a state of being lost in their errors. It's understood as a consequence of their persistent rejection, where their own choices contribute to a spiritual blindness that prevents them from benefiting from further signs.","arabic":"وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَارَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"111","text":"Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, and We gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones to believe, unless it is in Allah's plan. But most of them ignore (the truth).","commentary":"This verse provides striking examples of overwhelming, extraordinary miracles (angels appearing, the dead speaking, everything in existence testifying) to emphasize the point made in the previous two verses. It states that even if such incredible events were to occur right before their eyes, those who are set in their rejection would still not believe, unless Allah willed otherwise. This highlights that belief is fundamentally a matter of the heart's readiness and sincerity in seeking guidance, which is ultimately facilitated by Allah's will. It underscores that the reason for their disbelief is not a lack of sufficient evidence, but rather their own unwillingness to accept the truth that is already apparent. Many people, unfortunately, choose to disregard or ignore this truth.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَا إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَىٰ وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ قُبُلًا مَا كَانُوا لِيُؤْمِنُوا إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَاءَ اللَّهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?","commentary":"This verse highlights Allah's power in initiating life. It describes how a tiny seed or date stone is split open by Allah's command, allowing a plant to sprout. It also points to the constant process where life emerges from things that seem lifeless, and conversely, where living things return to a state where life departs. This ongoing cycle is presented as a clear sign of Allah's unique ability to create and control life. The verse asks, given this clear evidence, how can anyone turn away from acknowledging Allah's truth? This sets the stage for subsequent verses that present further signs of Allah's creative power in the universe.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَالِقُ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَىٰ ۖ يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَمُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتِ مِنَ الْحَيِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"He it is that cleaveth the day-break (from the dark): He makes the night for rest and tranquillity, and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of time): Such is the judgment and ordering of (Him), the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient.","commentary":"Following the theme of initiating life from the seemingly lifeless (like splitting a seed in Verse 95), this verse points to another remarkable event: the splitting of dawn from the darkness of night. It explains that Allah created the night for rest and made the sun and moon revolve in precise orbits for people to measure time. All of this, the break of day, the function of night, and the celestial movements, is the result of the precise planning and ordering of Allah, Who possesses ultimate power and knows everything. This illustrates the grand scale of Allah's power, complementing the small-scale examples in the previous verse.","arabic":"فَالِقُ الْإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ سَكَنًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَانًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ"},{"verse":"97","text":"It is He Who maketh the stars (as beacons) for you, that ye may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our signs for people who know.","commentary":"Building on the mention of celestial bodies in the previous verse (sun and moon for time), this verse highlights another benefit provided by Allah through the stars. Allah has made the stars serve as guides, allowing people to navigate across vast, dark stretches of land and sea, especially before modern tools. This act of providing guidance through the natural world is presented as a sign detailed for people who use their knowledge and intellect to reflect on Allah's creation. It links the practical use of the stars to a deeper understanding of the Creator.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُوا بِهَا فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۗ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"It is He Who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand.","commentary":"Shifting focus from the universe to humanity, this verse reminds us that Allah brought all of humanity into being from a single origin (often understood as Prophet Adam). It points out that this earth serves as both a temporary dwelling place during life and a place of transition (departure) after death. This fundamental truth about human existence and origin is presented as a sign for people who reflect and understand. It connects humanity's origin and destiny directly back to Allah, the Creator mentioned in the preceding verses showing universal signs.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ فَمُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمُسْتَوْدَعٌ ۗ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَفْقَهُونَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops), out of which We produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe.","commentary":"This verse returns to the theme of life springing from the earth, initiated by Allah, first introduced in Verse 95. It specifically highlights the role of rain sent down by Allah, which causes diverse vegetation to grow. The verse paints a vivid picture of this process, from green plants producing piled-up grain, to date palms with heavy clusters, and varied gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates, noting how they are similar in category but distinct in appearance and taste. It encourages reflection on the beauty of the ripening fruit and concludes that these natural wonders are clear signs for people whose hearts are open to belief.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ نَبَاتَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهُ خَضِرًا نُخْرِجُ مِنْهُ حَبًّا مُتَرَاكِبًا وَمِنَ النَّخْلِ مِنْ طَلْعِهَا قِنْوَانٌ دَانِيَةٌ وَجَنَّاتٍ مِنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالرُّمَّانَ مُشْتَبِهًا وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَابِهٍ ۗ انْظُرُوا إِلَىٰ ثَمَرِهِ إِذَا أَثْمَرَ وَيَنْعِهِ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكُمْ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah, though Allah did create the Jinns; and they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! (for He is) above what they attribute to Him!","commentary":"After presenting numerous signs of Allah's unique and unparalleled power as the Creator and Sustainer (Verses 95-99), this verse contrasts that reality with the beliefs of some who wrongly associate partners with Allah. It mentions that some associated the Jinn (spiritual beings created by Allah) as equals with Allah, despite the fact that Allah is their Creator. It also highlights the false attribution of sons and daughters to Allah, done out of ignorance and without any basis in knowledge. The verse strongly refutes these notions, proclaiming Allah's immense glory and transcendence above such incorrect descriptions. This serves as a stark contrast to the detailed descriptions of Allah's true nature and actions provided earlier.","arabic":"وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ الْجِنَّ وَخَلَقَهُمْ ۖ وَخَرَقُوا لَهُ بَنِينَ وَبَنَاتٍ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۚ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: How can He have a son when He hath no consort? He created all things, and He hath full knowledge of all things.","commentary":"This verse logically refutes the false attribution of a son to Allah, directly addressing the claim made in the previous verse. It emphasizes that Allah is the ultimate Originator of the heavens and the earth. The verse argues that having a child, as humans understand it, requires a partner or consort. Since Allah is unique, has no partner, and is the creator of everything, the concept of Him having a son is illogical and contrary to His nature as the sole, self-sufficient Creator. It reaffirms His absolute power and complete knowledge over all creation.","arabic":"بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُنْ لَهُ صَاحِبَةٌ ۖ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"102","text":"That is Allah, your Lord! there is no god but He, the Creator of all things: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs.","commentary":"This verse brings together the core message derived from the preceding signs and arguments (Verses 95-101). It declares unequivocally that this powerful Creator, Originator of life and the universe, is Allah, the only Lord. It reinforces that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him because He is the Creator of everything. Therefore, it directs humanity to worship and submit to Him alone. It concludes by stating that He is in complete control and manages all affairs. This verse serves as a direct command and conclusion based on the evidence presented about Allah's unique nature and actions.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَاعْبُدُوهُ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ"},{"verse":"103","text":"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things.","commentary":"Describing Allah's immense nature, this verse explains that human sight and understanding are limited and cannot fully encompass or comprehend Allah. Our vision is finite, but Allah's power and knowledge encompass all vision and everything we can perceive and know. Despite being beyond human comprehension, Allah is fully aware of all things, big or small. This verse highlights Allah's transcendence and perfection, contrasting with the limitations of created beings and reinforcing why only He is worthy of worship (as stated in Verse 102). It also implicitly addresses any demand for tangible \"proofs\" of Allah's existence by showing that He is beyond physical perception in this life.","arabic":"لَا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ ۖ وَهُوَ اللَّطِيفُ الْخَبِيرُ"},{"verse":"104","text":"\"Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings.\"","commentary":"Following the description of Allah's nature and the presentation of numerous signs throughout the preceding verses (95-103), this verse emphasizes that clear insights and proofs have indeed been sent from Allah. It clarifies that the choice to see and accept these proofs or to remain blind is a personal one. Accepting guidance is for one's own benefit, while rejecting it is to one's own detriment. The verse concludes by stating that the Prophet's role is simply to convey the message, not to force belief or to be a keeper over people's actions. This highlights the principle of individual accountability and freedom of choice in responding to divine guidance.","arabic":"قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَصَائِرُ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ فَلِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ عَمِيَ فَعَلَيْهَا ۚ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ"},{"verse":"112","text":"Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone.","commentary":"We understand that throughout history, Allah has established adversaries for every Messenger He sent. These adversaries come from among ill-intentioned humans and jinn, who influence one another by presenting falsehoods in appealing and deceptive ways. If Allah had willed otherwise, this opposition would not have occurred. Therefore, we are reminded to disregard their schemes and leave their judgment to Allah. This verse sets the stage by acknowledging that opposition to Allah's message and Messengers is a consistent challenge throughout history, allowed by Allah as part of His plan.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِيٍّ عَدُوًّا شَيَاطِينَ الْإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ يُوحِي بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُورًا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ رَبُّكَ مَا فَعَلُوهُ ۖ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"To such (deceit) let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may.","commentary":"This verse explains that the deceptive influence mentioned in the previous verse particularly appeals to the hearts of those who do not believe in accountability in the hereafter. They are drawn to such falsehoods, find pleasure in them, and pursue worldly gains through these means. This is also part of Allah's design, allowing individuals the freedom to choose their path and demonstrating the consequences of prioritizing this worldly life over the eternal one. This verse connects back to the previous one by showing who is most susceptible to the deceptive tactics of the adversaries.","arabic":"وَلِتَصْغَىٰ إِلَيْهِ أَفْئِدَةُ الَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْآخِرَةِ وَلِيَرْضَوْهُ وَلِيَقْتَرِفُوا مَا هُمْ مُقْتَرِفُونَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"Say: \"Shall I seek for judge other than Allah? - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail.\" They know full well, to whom We have given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt.","commentary":"In this verse, we are taught a fundamental principle: the ultimate authority for judgment and legislation rests solely with Allah. The Prophet is instructed to ask, \"Should I seek any judge other than Allah?\" This rhetorical question emphasizes that there is no valid alternative source for guidance, especially since Allah has sent the Qur'an, a Book that explains matters in detail. We are also reminded that even those who received previous divine scriptures recognized the truth of the Qur'an's divine origin. This highlights the clear, undeniable nature of Allah's guidance, contrasting with the deception mentioned in the prior verses.","arabic":"أَفَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَبْتَغِي حَكَمًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْكِتَابَ مُفَصَّلًا ۚ وَالَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ مُنَزَّلٌ مِنْ رَبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"115","text":"The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.","commentary":"Following the affirmation that Allah is the sole source of judgment, this verse emphasizes the perfection and finality of His message. We understand that Allah's directives and promises are perfectly true and just, and nothing can alter them. Allah possesses complete knowledge and hears everything. This reinforces the completeness and reliability of the divine guidance provided in the Qur'an, ensuring believers that Allah's word is the ultimate standard, unlike the conjecture mentioned in the subsequent verse.","arabic":"وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقًا وَعَدْلًا ۚ لَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"116","text":"Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead thee away from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothing but lie.","commentary":"This verse serves as a warning against relying on the opinions or practices of the majority of people on earth if they deviate from divine guidance. It explains that many people follow mere guesswork and speculation, leading themselves and others away from the straight path of Allah. This highlights the contrast between divine knowledge and human conjecture, emphasizing the importance of adhering to Allah's clearly explained Book mentioned in Verse 114, rather than popular, uninformed opinions.","arabic":"وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ"},{"verse":"117","text":"Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance.","commentary":"This verse reminds us that ultimately, Allah alone knows who has truly deviated from His path and who is rightly guided. While we are given criteria for guidance in His Book (as discussed in previous verses), the final judgment and complete understanding of people's hearts and intentions rest with Allah. This follows the warning against following those who are misguided (Verse 116) by reaffirming Allah's ultimate knowledge and authority in determining the state of individuals.","arabic":"إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ مَنْ يَضِلُّ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"118","text":"So eat of (meats) on which Allah's name hath been pronounced, if ye have faith in His signs.","commentary":"Transitioning from the broad principles of divine authority and guidance, this verse provides a specific instruction as a practical application of faith. Believers are directed to eat meat over which Allah's name has been pronounced during slaughter, if they truly believe in His signs (revelations). This connects obedience in daily life, like dietary laws, directly to the core concept of faith and acknowledging Allah's authority established in the preceding verses.","arabic":"فَكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"119","text":"Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which Allah's name hath been pronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead (men) by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion from the previous one by questioning why believers would hesitate to eat meat that is made lawful by pronouncing Allah's name over it. It highlights that Allah has already clearly explained what is forbidden, except in situations of extreme necessity. The verse then warns that many people, driven by their desires and lack of understanding, mislead others regarding what is lawful or unlawful. This reinforces that Allah's detailed instructions are the true standard, not human desires or ignorance, and affirms that Allah is fully aware of those who overstep His boundaries.","arabic":"وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُمْ مَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"120","text":"Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their \"earnings.\"","commentary":"Following the specific example of dietary laws and the warning against misleading others (which is a sin), this verse gives a general command to avoid all kinds of sin, whether done openly or hidden from others. It serves as a broader reminder that all actions, good or bad, are recorded and that those who commit sins will face the consequences of their actions. This verse provides a wider context of accountability before returning to the specific issue of forbidden meat in the next verse.","arabic":"وَذَرُوا ظَاهِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ الْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَقْتَرِفُونَ"},{"verse":"121","text":"Eat not of (meats) on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans.","commentary":"Concluding this specific discussion on dietary laws, this verse gives a strict prohibition: do not eat meat over which Allah's name has not been pronounced. It declares that doing so is a deviation from the right path. The verse then reveals that ill-intentioned beings inspire their allies to argue against this divine law. It gives a strong warning that if one were to follow such arguments and disregard Allah's ruling on this matter, it would be equivalent to associating partners with Allah. This is because accepting a law or judgment from someone other than Allah, in matters that Allah has legislated upon, is seen in Islam as giving that entity a share in Allah's unique right to set the law. This verse thus connects a specific religious practice (pronouncing Allah's name during slaughter) directly to the core concept of recognizing Allah's sole authority, which was introduced earlier in this passage.","arabic":"وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ ۗ وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"122","text":"Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing.","commentary":"This verse uses a powerful comparison to describe the difference between having faith and being without it. It asks if someone who was spiritually \"dead\" but was then given spiritual \"life\" by Allah, and provided with a \"light\" to navigate life among people, can be compared to someone who remains in deep \"darkness,\" unable to escape it.\n\nFrom a Muslim perspective, faith is seen as bringing spiritual life and clarity, allowing a person to understand existence and their purpose in a new way. It's like moving from a state of unawareness or spiritual death into a vibrant, illuminated existence. The \"light\" allows them to see the truth and live righteously among others.\n\nIn contrast, being without faith is described as being in profound darkness, unable to find the right path. The verse explains that, as a consequence of this state, the actions and choices of those without faith may seem right and appealing to them, even if they lead away from Allah's guidance. This sets the stage for understanding the spiritual states discussed in the verses that follow.","arabic":"أَوَمَنْ كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُورًا يَمْشِي بِهِ فِي النَّاسِ كَمَنْ مَثَلُهُ فِي الظُّلُمَاتِ لَيْسَ بِخَارِجٍ مِنْهَا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"123","text":"Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot (and burrow) therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceive it not.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's contrast between light and darkness, this verse speaks about the reality that in societies throughout history, Allah has allowed powerful individuals or \"leaders\" who are inclined towards wickedness to exist in prominent positions. These individuals often scheme and plot against the truth and those who follow it.\n\nThis isn't to say Allah forces them to be wicked, but that He allows their actions as part of the test of life. These individuals work together with others who share their inclination towards misguidance, trying to undermine the message of truth brought by messengers and believers.\n\nHowever, the verse highlights a key point: their plotting ultimately harms only themselves, even though they don't realize it. Their schemes may seem powerful, but in the larger scheme of things, they are working against Allah's ultimate plan and their own best interests in the afterlife. This offers reassurance to believers that, despite opposition, Allah is in control, and the efforts of opponents are ultimately futile against His will. This idea connects to the fate described in the next verse.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا فِي كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ أَكَابِرَ مُجْرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُوا فِيهَا ۖ وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلَّا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"124","text":"When there comes to them a sign (from Allah), They say: \"We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by Allah's messengers.\" Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah, and a severe punishment, for all their plots.","commentary":"This verse describes the arrogant attitude of some who oppose the truth, particularly those who hold positions of power mentioned in the previous verse. When evidence or a \"sign\" of Allah's truth comes to them, they demand to be given the same kind of direct communication or miracles that Allah's messengers received. Their arrogance and desire for special status prevent them from simply accepting the message delivered through the messenger.\n\nThe verse responds by stating clearly that Allah knows best who is suitable to be entrusted with His divine message. Choosing messengers is solely Allah's decision, based on His perfect knowledge of their character and worthiness, not on human demands or social status.\n\nIt then warns these arrogant schemers that, as a consequence of their rejection, plotting, and pride, they will face humiliation and severe punishment from Allah. Their worldly power and schemes will be worthless before their Creator. This serves as a direct consequence of the opposition described in the previous verse and contrasts with the guidance and light offered in Verse 122.","arabic":"وَإِذَا جَاءَتْهُمْ آيَةٌ قَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَا أُوتِيَ رُسُلُ اللَّهِ ۘ اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ ۗ سَيُصِيبُ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا صَغَارٌ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَمْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"125","text":"Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.","commentary":"This verse explains how Allah's will and a person's choice interact regarding guidance. It describes the internal state of individuals in relation to accepting or rejecting faith.\n\nWhen Allah wills to guide someone – which aligns with the person's openness and inclination towards truth – He makes their heart receptive and \"open\" to accepting \"Islam,\" which means submission to Allah. This acceptance feels natural and easy for them, like a burden being lifted.\n\nConversely, when Allah wills to let someone go astray – which aligns with their rejection and resistance to truth – He makes their heart feel \"tight and constricted,\" making it difficult and burdensome for them to accept guidance, as if they were trying to climb impossibly high into the sky. This difficult state is described as a consequence or \"penalty\" from Allah upon those who refuse to believe. It's a spiritual state that results from their own choices, facilitated by Allah's overarching will and the natural laws He has set in place.","arabic":"فَمَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ أَنْ يَهْدِيَهُ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُ لِلْإِسْلَامِ ۖ وَمَنْ يُرِدْ أَنْ يُضِلَّهُ يَجْعَلْ صَدْرَهُ ضَيِّقًا حَرَجًا كَأَنَّمَا يَصَّعَّدُ فِي السَّمَاءِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ الرِّجْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"126","text":"This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition.","commentary":"Following the explanation of the internal states related to guidance and misguidance in the previous verse, this verse declares that the path described – the path of faith, openness to guidance, and submission to Allah – is \"the way of your Lord.\" It is described as a \"straight path,\" indicating it is the correct and direct route to truth and salvation.\n\nAllah states that He has made His signs and revelations clear and detailed. However, He clarifies that this clarity is most beneficial for \"those who receive admonition\" or those who are willing to reflect, learn, and be guided by these signs. It emphasizes that while the path and signs are clear, a receptive heart and willingness to heed are necessary to benefit from them. This verse serves as a bridge, leading to the ultimate outcome promised to those who follow this straight path, which is mentioned in the next verse.","arabic":"وَهَٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيمًا ۗ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"127","text":"For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised (righteousness).","commentary":"This verse describes the blessed destination and reward for those who follow the straight path mentioned in the previous verse, who have accepted guidance and whose hearts were open to faith (as described in Verse 125). Their reward is a \"home of peace\" in the presence of their Lord, Allah. This signifies Paradise, a place of ultimate tranquility and security.\n\nMore significantly, it states that Allah will be their \"friend\" or protector and supporter. This deep connection and special relationship with Allah is given \"because they practiced (righteousness).\" This highlights that belief must be accompanied by good deeds and righteous living. It's not just about intellectual assent but about living a life in submission to Allah, following the guidance He has provided. This serves as the beautiful conclusion to the passage, showing the ultimate reward for choosing the path of light and guidance.","arabic":"لَهُمْ دَارُ السَّلَامِ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"128","text":"One day will He gather them all together, (and say): \"O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men.\" Their friends amongst men will say: \"Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth.\" for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.","commentary":"This verse describes a scene from the Day of Judgment when Allah will gather everyone, including humans and jinn. Allah addresses the jinn, stating that they misled many humans. Then, those humans who were influenced by the jinn will respond, acknowledging that they benefited from each other during their earthly lives but have now reached the end of the time Allah appointed for them. Allah then declares that the Fire will be their permanent dwelling, unless Allah wills otherwise. This highlights Allah's absolute power and knowledge, emphasizing that His judgments are based on perfect wisdom. This scene sets the stage for understanding the consequences of following influences that lead away from Allah's guidance.","arabic":"وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ قَدِ اسْتَكْثَرْتُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ ۖ وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ رَبَّنَا اسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ وَبَلَغْنَا أَجَلَنَا الَّذِي أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا ۚ قَالَ النَّارُ مَثْوَاكُمْ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"129","text":"Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn.","commentary":"Following the depiction of the jinn and humans being judged together, this verse explains a general principle: This is how Allah causes those who do wrong to become allies with one another. Their shared actions and objectives create a connection between them. This connects back to the previous verse by showing that the alliance and mutual influence between the jinn and the humans who followed them was a consequence of their wrongdoing and will lead them to a shared fate.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُوَلِّي بَعْضَ الظَّالِمِينَ بَعْضًا بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"130","text":"\"O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you, setting forth unto you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\" They will say: \"We bear witness against ourselves.\" It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.","commentary":"Continuing the scene from the Day of Judgment, Allah addresses the gathered jinn and humans, asking if messengers came to them, presenting Allah's signs and warning them about this Day. They will admit against themselves that yes, messengers did come. They confess that the attractions and distractions of worldly life had led them astray. Because of this deception and their rejection of faith despite the warnings, they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers. This emphasizes Allah's justice; He does not punish people without first sending messengers to convey His message and warn them. This verse builds on the previous ones by showing that their alliance in wrongdoing occurred despite them receiving divine warnings.","arabic":"يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِنْكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِي وَيُنْذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَاءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَٰذَا ۚ قَالُوا شَهِدْنَا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِنَا ۖ وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا وَشَهِدُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا كَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"131","text":"(The messengers were sent) thus, for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men's habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned.","commentary":"This verse explains the reason behind sending messengers, as mentioned in the previous verse. It clarifies that Allah would never destroy communities for their wrongdoing without first sending messengers to warn them. This highlights Allah's immense grace and justice; He provides clear guidance and warnings before any accountability or punishment occurs. It shows that the confession in the previous verse came after they had every opportunity to receive guidance.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ أَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا غَافِلُونَ"},{"verse":"132","text":"To all are degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds: for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.","commentary":"This verse establishes the principle of varying degrees or ranks for everyone based on their actions. It assures that Allah is completely aware of everything people do, down to the finest detail. This applies to both those who do good and those who do wrong; each will have a status corresponding to their deeds. This follows from the previous verses discussing accountability and judgment, explaining that the outcome is directly linked to the actions performed in this life, of which Allah is perfectly aware.","arabic":"وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَاتٌ مِمَّا عَمِلُوا ۚ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"133","text":"Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were His will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors, even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute independence and His great mercy. It states that Allah does not need humanity and, if He willed, He could remove everyone and replace them with others, just as He brought the current generation into being from previous ones. This serves as a reminder of human dependence on Allah's will and highlights His power over creation. It also underscores His mercy in allowing people time and sending guidance, despite being fully capable of replacing them instantly. This serves as a powerful statement about Allah's sovereignty in contrast to the actions of wrongdoers discussed earlier.","arabic":"وَرَبُّكَ الْغَنِيُّ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ ۚ إِنْ يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِنْ بَعْدِكُمْ مَا يَشَاءُ كَمَا أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ"},{"verse":"134","text":"All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can ye frustrate it (in the least bit).","commentary":"Following the mention of Allah's power and ability to replace humanity, this verse gives a strong warning and assurance: everything that has been promised, particularly regarding accountability and the consequences of actions (like the Day of Judgment depicted earlier), will certainly happen. It emphasizes that no one can prevent or escape it. This reinforces the seriousness of the warnings given by the messengers and the inevitability of facing the outcome of one's deeds.","arabic":"إِنَّ مَا تُوعَدُونَ لَآتٍ ۖ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ"},{"verse":"135","text":"Say: \"O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): soon will ye know who it is whose end will be (best) in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper.\"","commentary":"This verse contains a message conveyed through Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to his people. It's a declaration of confidence in the truth and a challenge to those who oppose it. He tells them to continue acting according to their ways, while he will continue following the guidance given to him. The verse assures that the ultimate outcome will become clear in the Hereafter, stating with certainty that those who do wrong will never truly succeed or prosper. This serves as a concluding statement to this passage, contrasting the sure path of those who follow guidance with the inevitable failure of those who persist in wrongdoing.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا قَوْمِ اعْمَلُوا عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّي عَامِلٌ ۖ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ تَكُونُ لَهُ عَاقِبَةُ الدَّارِ ۗ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"136","text":"Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: \"This is for Allah, and this\" - for our \"partners\"! but the share of their\" partners \"reacheth not Allah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their \"partners\"! evil (and unjust) is their assignment!","commentary":"This verse speaks about how people in pre-Islamic Arabian society dealt with the abundance Allah provided from their crops and livestock. Allah is the One who created and provided these resources. However, these people would divide what Allah gave them, setting aside a portion they claimed was for Allah, and another portion for the deities or partners they associated with Him. The verse highlights the injustice of this division: they would often take from the portion set aside for Allah and add it to the portion of their partners, but they would never take from the partners' portion and add it to Allah's. This unfairness shows their misguided beliefs and priorities, judging very poorly in their allocation of what Allah had provided. This verse sets the stage for the following discussion by showing how people wrongly attributed authority to others alongside Allah over the resources He created.","arabic":"وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالْأَنْعَامِ نَصِيبًا فَقَالُوا هَٰذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَٰذَا لِشُرَكَائِنَا ۖ فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَائِهِمْ فَلَا يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ شُرَكَائِهِمْ ۗ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ"},{"verse":"137","text":"Even so, in the eyes of most of the pagans, their \"partners\" made alluring the slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not have done so: But leave alone them and their inventions.","commentary":"Following the mention of their unfair division of produce, this verse introduces another disturbing practice influenced by the \"partners\" they associated with Allah. These partners, whether misguided human leaders like priests and chiefs or evil spiritual beings (jinn), made the killing of their own children seem acceptable. This practice included burying daughters alive out of fear of poverty or shame, and sometimes even sacrificing sons to their deities. The verse explains that the purpose behind this influence was to bring people to ruin and confuse them about their faith, causing them to lose their way and live in moral and social disorder. The verse also reminds us that nothing happens without Allah's overarching will and permission, and then directs the Prophet Muhammad, and through him, the believers, to leave these people and their false inventions to Allah's judgment. This continues the theme from the previous verse, illustrating further how people allowed influences other than divine guidance to dictate their lives, even in the most sensitive matters like family.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَادِهِمْ شُرَكَاؤُهُمْ لِيُرْدُوهُمْ وَلِيَلْبِسُوا عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا فَعَلُوهُ ۖ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"138","text":"And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo, and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further, there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which, (at slaughter), the name of Allah is not pronounced; - inventions against Allah's name: soon will He requite them for their inventions.","commentary":"Building on the examples of misguided practices regarding Allah's provisions, this verse details further arbitrary rules people invented about livestock and crops. They would declare certain types of cattle and produce forbidden, claiming that only specific individuals (presumably priests or those with authority among them) were allowed to eat them, supposedly with Allah's permission – a permission they falsely claimed. They also designated certain animals as forbidden from being used for work or carrying burdens. Additionally, some cattle were slaughtered without mentioning Allah's name, instead invoking the names of their associated partners or idols. The verse explicitly states that all these prohibitions and claims were lies invented against Allah. It warns that Allah will certainly hold them accountable for these fabrications. This verse reinforces the theme that legislating or making things lawful or unlawful without divine authority is a serious deviation from true faith.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا هَٰذِهِ أَنْعَامٌ وَحَرْثٌ حِجْرٌ لَا يَطْعَمُهَا إِلَّا مَنْ نَشَاءُ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَأَنْعَامٌ حُرِّمَتْ ظُهُورُهَا وَأَنْعَامٌ لَا يَذْكُرُونَ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا افْتِرَاءً عَلَيْهِ ۚ سَيَجْزِيهِمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"139","text":"They say: \"What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men, and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born, then all have share therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to Allah), He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.","commentary":"This verse provides another specific and particularly illogical example of the arbitrary rules regarding livestock from the previous verse. These people claimed that the offspring inside the wombs of certain cattle were exclusively for their men, and forbidden for their women. However, in a strange twist, if the offspring was stillborn, then both men and women were allowed to partake of it. This demonstrates the sheer irrationality of the rules they invented and attributed to Allah. The verse follows with a clear warning that Allah will punish them for these false assertions and the superstitions they attributed to Him. It emphasizes that Allah is full of wisdom and knowledge, implying that His true laws are based on perfect wisdom, unlike the absurd rules they fabricated. This continues the critique of people's false claims about what Allah has permitted or forbidden.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا مَا فِي بُطُونِ هَٰذِهِ الْأَنْعَامِ خَالِصَةٌ لِذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِنَا ۖ وَإِنْ يَكُنْ مَيْتَةً فَهُمْ فِيهِ شُرَكَاءُ ۚ سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"140","text":"Lost are those who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them, inventing (lies) against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.","commentary":"This verse summarizes the misguided actions previously mentioned (killing children and forbidding provisions) and declares the consequence. It describes those who committed these acts out of foolishness and ignorance, based on lies they invented against Allah, as utterly lost. They have strayed far from the right path and have become unresponsive to true guidance. This serves as a strong condemnation of such practices and highlights the severity of their deviation, linking their harmful social customs directly to their fabrication of falsehoods against Allah and their subsequent loss of guidance. It acts as a concluding statement on the specific examples of pagan misguidance discussed in verses 136-139.","arabic":"قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ قَتَلُوا أَوْلَادَهُمْ سَفَهًا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَحَرَّمُوا مَا رَزَقَهُمُ اللَّهُ افْتِرَاءً عَلَى اللَّهِ ۚ قَدْ ضَلُّوا وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"141","text":"It is He Who produceth gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, and tilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for Allah loveth not the wasters.","commentary":"After condemning the pagan practices of forbidding and misallocating provisions, this verse shifts focus to affirm Allah as the sole Creator and Provider of all wealth and sustenance. It beautifully describes the variety of gardens, date palms, diverse crops, olives, and pomegranates that Allah produces, highlighting their similarities yet distinct varieties. It then gives a simple and direct instruction from Allah: eat of their fruits when they ripen, and give what is due to the poor and needy on the day of harvest. It also warns against wasting by excess. This verse provides a clear contrast to the arbitrary and unjust rules of the previous verses. It establishes that the authority to permit and regulate the use of resources belongs to the One who created them, which is Allah, and His commands are based on justice, generosity, and avoiding waste.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْشَأَ جَنَّاتٍ مَعْرُوشَاتٍ وَغَيْرَ مَعْرُوشَاتٍ وَالنَّخْلَ وَالزَّرْعَ مُخْتَلِفًا أُكُلُهُ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالرُّمَّانَ مُتَشَابِهًا وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَابِهٍ ۚ كُلُوا مِنْ ثَمَرِهِ إِذَا أَثْمَرَ وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ ۖ وَلَا تُسْرِفُوا ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ"},{"verse":"142","text":"Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you and avowed enemy.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of Allah's provisions from the previous verse, this verse specifically mentions livestock. It reminds people that Allah created cattle for various purposes, including carrying burdens and providing meat for consumption. It then gives a clear permission and instruction: eat of what Allah has provided for you. Immediately following this, it warns against following the footsteps of Satan, emphasizing that Satan is a clear and open enemy to humanity. This connects the simple, divinely-given permission to benefit from livestock with the prohibition of following Satan's path. Given that the previous verses detailed arbitrary prohibitions regarding cattle, this verse implies that those man-made, irrational rules were essentially following Satan's lead, contrasting it with the straightforward guidance from Allah, the true Provider.","arabic":"وَمِنَ الْأَنْعَامِ حَمُولَةً وَفَرْشًا ۚ كُلُوا مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"143","text":"(Take) eight (head of cattle) in (four) pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if ye are truthful:","commentary":"This verse, along with the next, specifically challenges the arbitrary prohibitions regarding livestock that were mentioned earlier (like in verses 138 and 139). It names specific types of cattle: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats (male and female for each). It then poses a direct question to those who invented prohibitions: Did Allah forbid the males from these pairs? Or the females? Or the young developing in the females' wombs? It demands they answer based on knowledge, if they are truthful in their claims that these prohibitions came from Allah. This systematic questioning exposes the lack of any legitimate basis or evidence for their invented rules, highlighting their falsehood by contrasting them with Allah's clear creation of these animals.","arabic":"ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ ۖ مِنَ الضَّأْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ الْمَعْزِ اثْنَيْنِ ۗ قُلْ آلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ ۖ نَبِّئُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"144","text":"Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead astray men without knowledge? For Allah guideth not people who do wrong.","commentary":"This verse continues the challenge from the previous one, applying the same questions to other types of cattle: a pair of camels and a pair of oxen (male and female for each). It asks again if Allah forbade the males, females, or unborn young. The questioning then escalates, asking if they were *present* when Allah supposedly issued such commands. This rhetorical question underscores the impossibility of their claim; they had no divine revelation or witness to support their prohibitions. The verse concludes with a strong condemnation, stating that no one is more unjust than someone who invents lies against Allah to mislead others out of ignorance. Such people, the verse states, are not guided by Allah, emphasizing the severe consequence of fabricating divine law. This powerfully reinforces the message that only Allah has the right to legislate and that claiming such authority or attributing false laws to Him is a grave sin that leads people astray.","arabic":"وَمِنَ الْإِبِلِ اثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ اثْنَيْنِ ۗ قُلْ آلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الْأُنْثَيَيْنِ ۖ أَمْ كُنْتُمْ شُهَدَاءَ إِذْ وَصَّاكُمُ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا ۚ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا لِيُضِلَّ النَّاسَ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"145","text":"Say: \"I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine,- for it is an abomination - or, what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah's\". But (even so), if a person is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the extensive critique of man-made prohibitions regarding food and livestock in the preceding verses, this verse provides a clear statement of what Allah has actually forbidden in the message revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It explicitly lists four categories of meat that are forbidden: dead animals (carrion), blood that is poured forth, the flesh of swine (pork), which is described as impure, and meat from an animal slaughtered while invoking a name other than Allah's (which is considered a sinful offering). This concise list directly counters the numerous arbitrary prohibitions invented by people. The verse then provides an important exception: if a person is compelled by necessity (like starvation) to eat from these forbidden things, without intending disobedience or exceeding the amount needed, then Allah is forgiving and merciful. This demonstrates Allah's compassion and ease in His law, contrasting sharply with the irrational and burdensome rules people had imposed upon themselves. This verse serves as a definitive statement on dietary prohibitions, establishing the true divine ruling after dismantling the false human ones.","arabic":"قُلْ لَا أَجِدُ فِي مَا أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَىٰ طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ إِلَّا أَنْ يَكُونَ مَيْتَةً أَوْ دَمًا مَسْفُوحًا أَوْ لَحْمَ خِنْزِيرٍ فَإِنَّهُ رِجْسٌ أَوْ فِسْقًا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ ۚ فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلَا عَادٍ فَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"146","text":"For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances).","commentary":"Continuing the discussion about what is permissible and forbidden, this verse addresses specific food restrictions that were imposed upon those who followed the Jewish tradition. Allah tells us that certain animals, like those with undivided hooves, were forbidden to them, as was the fat of oxen and sheep, with specific exceptions. We are told that these particular prohibitions were not universal decrees but were a consequence of their disobedience. This highlights that the authority to make things lawful or unlawful rests solely with Allah, and sometimes prohibitions can be a form of consequence or punishment for past actions. It contrasts with the unauthorized prohibitions mentioned earlier in the passage, reinforcing that only Allah has the right to legislate.","arabic":"وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ هَادُوا حَرَّمْنَا كُلَّ ذِي ظُفُرٍ ۖ وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ وَالْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَا إِلَّا مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَا أَوِ الْحَوَايَا أَوْ مَا اخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَاهُمْ بِبَغْيِهِمْ ۖ وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ"},{"verse":"147","text":"If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: \"Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back.","commentary":"This verse provides guidance on how to respond to those who deny the truth of the divine message. It instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to remind them of Allah's vast and all-encompassing mercy. Allah is merciful to everyone, believers and disbelievers alike, giving them time and opportunity to turn back. However, it also sternly warns that when Allah's wrath descends upon those who are deliberate in their wrongdoing and guilt, it cannot be averted. This serves as a reminder that while Allah is incredibly merciful, persistent denial and opposition to the truth have severe consequences, reinforcing the seriousness of accepting His guidance presented in the previous verses.","arabic":"فَإِنْ كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُلْ رَبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَاسِعَةٍ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"148","text":"Those who give partners (to Allah) will say: \"If Allah had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any taboos.\" So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath.

Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a common argument used by those who associate partners with Allah (idolaters) and who invent unauthorized prohibitions, as discussed in the preceding verses. They try to justify their actions by claiming it is simply Allah's will that they are in this state of disbelief and error (\"If Allah had wished...\"). Allah exposes this as a false argument, pointing out that previous generations used similar lies until they faced divine punishment. The response commanded in this verse challenges them to produce any certain knowledge to support their claim. It points out that they are relying on mere speculation and falsehood, not on any revealed truth or logical evidence. This contrasts with the clear divine laws and instructions provided by Allah.","arabic":"سَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلَا آبَاؤُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا ۗ قُلْ هَلْ عِنْدَكُمْ مِنْ عِلْمٍ فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَا ۖ إِنْ تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ أَنْتُمْ إِلَّا تَخْرُصُونَ"},{"verse":"149","text":"Say: \"With Allah is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all.\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse's refutation of the idolaters' false argument based on Allah's will, this verse clarifies where the real \"argument\" or compelling proof lies: it is with Allah. Allah possesses the ultimate truth and the power to present it convincingly to everyone. The verse also acknowledges that Allah has the absolute power to guide everyone if He chose to do so (\"if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all\"). However, the fact that not everyone is guided implies that His wisdom entails testing humanity by giving them the capacity for choice. The \"argument that reaches home\" refers to the clear, decisive truth and guidance that Allah has revealed, which is accessible to those who sincerely seek it, unlike the mere conjecture of the disbelievers.","arabic":"قُلْ فَلِلَّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَالِغَةُ ۖ فَلَوْ شَاءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"150","text":"Say: \"Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so.\" If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.","commentary":"This verse issues a strong challenge to those who invent prohibitions and claim they are from Allah, following up on the challenge to produce \"certain knowledge\" in Verse 148. It demands that they produce witnesses to prove that Allah commanded these unauthorized restrictions. If they were somehow to produce such witnesses, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is instructed not to be associated with them. The verse then provides a clear description of those who invent such lies and deny divine authority: they follow their own desires, reject Allah's signs (revelations), disbelieve in the Hereafter, and, critically, consider others equal to Allah in His authority and power. This highlights that unauthorized legislation is fundamentally a form of associating partners with Allah, just like worshipping idols, a core theme linking this passage to the very beginning of the Surah which condemns those who \"regard other beings as equal to their Lord\" (Verse 1).","arabic":"قُلْ هَلُمَّ شُهَدَاءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ يَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَ هَٰذَا ۖ فَإِنْ شَهِدُوا فَلَا تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ ۚ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَالَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْآخِرَةِ وَهُمْ بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ"},{"verse":"151","text":"Say: \"Come, I will rehearse what Allah hath (really) prohibited you from\": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.","commentary":"Following the rejection of the disbelievers' false prohibitions, this verse introduces a list of what Allah has *actually* forbidden, presented as clear and fundamental commandments. The list begins with the most important prohibition: associating anything as equal with Allah. This foundational principle underlies all other laws and ethics. It is followed by essential social and moral directives: being kind to parents, not killing children out of poverty (with the reassurance that Allah provides for everyone), staying away from all forms of shameful or indecent acts (both public and private), and not taking any life unjustly. This collection of core prohibitions covers fundamental aspects of belief, family relations, basic human rights, and public morality, demonstrating that true divine guidance encompasses all these areas. The verse concludes by stating that Allah commands these things so that people may use their reason and understand the wisdom behind them, connecting faith and ethics to intellect.","arabic":"قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ مِنْ إِمْلَاقٍ ۖ نَحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"152","text":"And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember.","commentary":"This verse continues the list of fundamental divine commandments, building upon the moral framework established in the previous verse. It focuses on ethical conduct in social and financial dealings. We are commanded to protect and manage the property of orphans with the sole aim of improving it until they reach maturity. We are also instructed to use just measure and weight in all transactions, ensuring fairness in business. A principle of divine justice is mentioned: Allah does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. The commandment extends to just speech and testimony, requiring truthfulness even if it goes against one's own relatives, highlighting the primacy of justice over personal ties. Finally, it enjoins fulfilling the covenant made with Allah, which encompasses all these duties. These commandments are given so that people may remember their obligations to Allah and to each other, demonstrating how practical ethics are intertwined with faith and the divine covenant.","arabic":"وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ ۖ وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۖ وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۖ وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"153","text":"Verily, this is My way, leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His (great) path: thus doth He command you. that ye may be righteous.","commentary":"Concluding the list of commandments from the previous two verses (151-152), this verse summarizes their significance. Allah declares that this collection of directives – starting with the prohibition of associating partners with Him and including duties to parents, protection of life and property, honesty, and justice – constitutes His single straight path. It emphasizes that this is the *only* way to follow and explicitly warns against following any other paths, as they will lead people astray from the true way. By following these commandments, which stem from recognizing Allah's sole authority and avoiding all forms of idolatry (including unauthorized legislation), people can achieve righteousness and become conscious of Allah. This verse serves as a powerful conclusion to the passage, reinforcing that true faith and correct practice are inseparable and defined solely by Allah's commands, as opposed to human inventions or deviations.","arabic":"وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"154","text":"Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our favour) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.","commentary":"This verse tells us about the Book given to Prophet Moses (the Torah). Allah completed His favor upon those who strove to do right, providing them with a Book that explained everything they needed to know to practice their faith. This Book was a source of guidance and mercy, intended to help the people believe in the reality of meeting their Lord in the Hereafter and receiving His grace. This connects back to the previous verses which outlined a straight path; here, we see that Allah has provided guidance through His messengers and books throughout history, establishing a continuous divine path.","arabic":"ثُمَّ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ تَمَامًا عَلَى الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ وَتَفْصِيلًا لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَعَلَّهُمْ بِلِقَاءِ رَبِّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"155","text":"And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that ye may receive mercy:","commentary":"Following from the mention of the Book given to Prophet Moses, this verse introduces the Qur'an, describing it as a blessed Book that Allah has revealed. Just as the Torah was a guide and mercy, the Qur'an is also a source of immense blessing. It instructs people to follow its teachings and to be conscious of Allah (righteous), assuring them that this is the way to receive Allah's mercy. This highlights the continuity of divine revelation, with the Qur'an being the latest and final blessed guidance.","arabic":"وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُوا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ"},{"verse":"156","text":"Lest ye should say: \"The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:\"","commentary":"Allah sent the Qur'an, addressed to all people, to remove any possible excuses for not following His guidance. This verse points out one such excuse that people might have made: claiming that divine books were only sent to earlier communities (like the Jews and Christians), and therefore, they remained ignorant of what those books contained. This verse, along with the next, explains that the Qur'an was revealed precisely so that no one could make such a claim.","arabic":"أَنْ تَقُولُوا إِنَّمَا أُنْزِلَ الْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ طَائِفَتَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَإِنْ كُنَّا عَنْ دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"157","text":"Or lest ye should say: \"If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they.\" Now then hath come unto you a clear (sign) from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah's signs, and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs, with a dreadful penalty, for their turning away.","commentary":"Continuing the point from the previous verse, this verse addresses another potential excuse: claiming that if they had received a divine book, they would have followed its guidance better than previous communities did. Allah states that now, with the revelation of the Qur'an, a clear sign, guidance, and mercy has indeed come to them from their Lord. Given this, the verse asks, who could be more unjust or wrongful than someone who denies Allah's clear signs and turns away from them? It concludes with a warning of severe punishment for those who deliberately turn away from these signs.","arabic":"أَوْ تَقُولُوا لَوْ أَنَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّا أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ ۚ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا ۗ سَنَجْزِي الَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَصْدِفُونَ"},{"verse":"158","text":"Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord (Himself), or certain of the signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: \"Wait ye: we too are waiting.\"","commentary":"Following the warnings in the previous verses about rejecting the clear guidance, this verse questions what more the disbelievers are waiting for. Are they waiting for angels to appear, or for Allah Himself (which is impossible in this life), or for specific, overwhelming signs from Allah? The verse gives a stern warning: on the day when certain decisive signs from Allah appear, it will be too late for a soul to believe if it had not believed before, or if its faith had not led to righteous actions. True faith must be embraced and acted upon before such a decisive moment arrives. The Prophet is instructed to tell them, \"Wait if you will; we too are waiting,\" indicating that the consequences will inevitably arrive. This connects to the earlier part of the sura where similar warnings were given regarding disbelief after demanding signs.","arabic":"هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَنْ تَأْتِيَهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ رَبُّكَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ بَعْضُ آيَاتِ رَبِّكَ ۗ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ آيَاتِ رَبِّكَ لَا يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِنْ قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا ۗ قُلِ انْتَظِرُوا إِنَّا مُنْتَظِرُونَ"},{"verse":"159","text":"As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did.","commentary":"After addressing the rejection of divine guidance, this verse distinguishes the path of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers from those who have divided their religion and formed different groups or sects. It makes it clear that the Prophet has no association with such divisions. This emphasizes the importance of unity based on the pure submission to Allah alone, without creating divisions or following separate paths. The verse concludes by stating that the matter of those who divide their religion rests with Allah, and He will inform them of the reality of their actions in the Hereafter, where everyone will be held accountable. This verse marks a clear distinction between the unified path of Islam and other differing ways.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"160","text":"He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall be done unto (any of) them.","commentary":"Following the mention of accountability in the previous verse for those who divided their religion, this verse elaborates on the principle of reward and requital in the Hereafter. It states Allah's immense generosity towards those who do good: they will be rewarded ten times the value of their good deed. In contrast, a person who does an evil deed will only be requited with its like; they will not be punished more than the evil they committed. This highlights Allah's justice and mercy, assuring that no one will be wronged, but rather, good is multiplied while evil is requited justly. This provides a basis for understanding the accountability mentioned in the preceding verse.","arabic":"مَنْ جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا ۖ وَمَنْ جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَىٰ إِلَّا مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"161","text":"Say: \"Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a series of declarations that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is instructed to make, defining his path and faith. He declares that his Lord has guided him to a straight path, described as an upright and true religion. This is identified as the path of Prophet Abraham, who is highlighted as a true monotheist who did not associate any partners with Allah. This connects the Prophet's message to the ancient, pure monotheistic tradition of Prophet Abraham, emphasizing continuity and a return to the original, undivided faith. It follows from the distinction made in previous verses regarding those who divide their religion.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"162","text":"Say: \"Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for Allah, the Cherisher of the Worlds:","commentary":"Continuing the declaration of faith, this verse expresses a complete and absolute dedication to Allah alone. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is instructed to declare that all his acts of worship, including prayer and sacrifice, as well as his entire life and death, are dedicated solely to Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all the worlds. This signifies a total surrender and devotion, encompassing every aspect of existence, making it clear that the purpose of life is to serve Allah alone. This builds upon the previous verse's declaration of following the straight path of Abraham, which is characterized by exclusive devotion to Allah.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"163","text":"No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.","commentary":"This verse concludes the declaration of exclusive devotion introduced in the previous verse. It explicitly states that Allah has no partner, reinforcing the core principle of monotheism. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) declares that this absolute dedication to Allah alone is what he has been commanded to do. He also states that he is the foremost among those who surrender themselves to Allah's will. This emphasizes the purity of his faith and his role as a prime example of submission, which is the essence of Islam. This serves as a definitive statement distinguishing this faith from any system that involves associating partners with Allah, linking back to the discussion of different sects and the way of Abraham.","arabic":"لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ"},{"verse":"164","text":"Say: \"Shall I seek for (my) Cherisher other than Allah, when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)? Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is towards Allah: He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed.\"","commentary":"This verse begins by posing a question through Prophet Muhammad, highlighting a fundamental principle of faith: should anyone seek a master, sustainer, or guide other than Allah? This is presented as illogical because Allah is the Sustainer and Lord of everything in the universe. All things exist and are maintained by Him.\n\nThe verse then clarifies a crucial aspect of accountability: each person is solely responsible for their own actions. Whatever good or bad a person does affects only themselves; no individual will be held accountable or bear the consequences for the wrongdoings of another. This emphasizes personal responsibility before Allah.\n\nFollowing from the idea of individual accountability, the verse concludes by stating that the ultimate destination for all is Allah. To Him everyone will return. On the Day of Judgment, Allah will reveal the truth about all the matters over which people disagreed and disputed in this life, and each person will be judged based on their own deeds. This connects to the previous verses which spoke about Allah's guidance and the straight path, emphasizing that accountability for following or deviating from that path rests squarely on the individual.","arabic":"قُلْ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَبْغِي رَبًّا وَهُوَ رَبُّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ ۚ وَلَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلَّا عَلَيْهَا ۚ وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"165","text":"It is He Who hath made you (His) agents, inheritors of the earth: He hath raised you in ranks, some above others: that He may try you in the gifts He hath given you: for thy Lord is quick in punishment: yet He is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's theme of Allah's Lordship and human accountability, this verse explains our role on Earth. It tells us that Allah has appointed human beings as His stewards or agents on Earth, giving them the responsibility to inhabit and manage it.\n\nAllah has also created differences among people, raising some in status, abilities, or resources above others. The purpose of these differences is not arbitrary but is a form of test. Allah tries or tests people through the gifts, abilities, and provisions He has given them, to see how they use them and whether they are grateful or ungrateful.\n\nThe verse concludes by describing two contrasting, yet complementary, aspects of Allah's nature. He is described as being \"quick in punishment,\" signifying that He has the power and ability to hold people accountable swiftly for their actions, especially those who persist in wrongdoing or rebellion. However, immediately following this, it is stated that He is also \"Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" This highlights His immense mercy and willingness to forgive those who turn to Him in sincere repentance. This balance underscores the reality of both accountability for actions and the opportunity for divine mercy. This verse reinforces the connection to Verse 164 by explaining the context of human life on Earth – a period of stewardship and trial, leading to the ultimate return and reckoning with Allah.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَائِفَ الْأَرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَا آتَاكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"}];
