    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"A. L. R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom.","commentary":"This verse opens with three letters from the Arabic alphabet: Alif, Lam, Ra. We understand these letters to be a sign from Allah, indicating that this divine book, though composed of the very same letters the Arabs used in their everyday language, is miraculous. Despite being masters of eloquence, they were unable to produce anything like the Qur'an, demonstrating its divine origin. The verse then describes the book itself as \"the Book of Wisdom,\" highlighting that its teachings and guidance are based on profound wisdom.","arabic":"الر ۚ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْكِتَابِ الْحَكِيمِ"},{"verse":"2","text":"Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves?- that he should warn mankind (of their danger), and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: \"This is indeed an evident sorcerer!\"","commentary":"Following the description of the Qur'an as a book of wisdom, this verse poses a question, wondering why people find it strange that Allah would send a messenger from among humanity. It explains that the purpose of sending a messenger is to warn all people about the consequences of rejecting Allah's guidance and to give good news to those who believe, promising them a high and true standing with Allah. However, the verse notes the reaction of some who do not believe, dismissing the messenger and his message as mere sorcery, unable to comprehend its divine nature. This reaction shows their misunderstanding or dismissal of the powerful and transformative effect of the divine message.","arabic":"أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنْذِرِ النَّاسَ وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ ۗ قَالَ الْكَافِرُونَ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne (of authority), regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition?","commentary":"This verse strongly asserts the reality of Allah's Lordship, connecting it directly to His role as the Creator of the vast universe, the heavens and the earth, which He created according to His plan over a period described as six days. It states that He is firmly established on the Throne, a description of His ultimate authority and control, managing and regulating all matters. It clarifies that no one can intercede with Him except by His permission, emphasizing that all power and decision-making rest solely with Him. This verse calls people to acknowledge Allah as their true Lord and to worship Him alone, meaning to submit to Him in all aspects of life, not just rituals. It challenges people to take this truth to heart and receive admonition from it. This emphasis on Allah's sole Lordship contrasts with the practice of associating others with Him, which was mentioned in the previous verse's description of the unbelievers' reaction.","arabic":"إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ ۖ يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۖ مَا مِنْ شَفِيعٍ إِلَّا مِنْ بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a penalty grievous, because they did reject Him.","commentary":"Continuing from the declaration of Allah's Lordship in Verse 3, this verse reminds everyone that their ultimate return is to Allah. It stresses that Allah's promise of this return is true and certain. It highlights that just as Allah initiated creation, He is also capable of bringing all of creation back to life. The purpose of this return and revival is for Allah to justly reward those who believed and lived righteously according to His guidance. Conversely, it states that those who rejected Him will face a severe consequence, described as suffering and scalding drink, as a result of their rejection. This underscores the accountability that comes with acknowledging Allah's Lordship and receiving His message.","arabic":"إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا ۖ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقًّا ۚ إِنَّهُ يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail, for those who understand.","commentary":"Following the explanation of Allah's Lordship and the return to Him for accountability, this verse presents specific examples of Allah's creation in the universe as signs of His power and wisdom. It describes the sun as a source of intense light and the moon as a reflected light, detailing how Allah has set the moon through phases. This precise arrangement is designed so that people can measure time, calculate years, and keep count. The verse emphasizes that Allah created all of this not by chance or falsehood, but in accordance with truth and a wise purpose. It states that Allah makes these signs clear and detailed for those who possess knowledge and understanding, linking back to the wisdom mentioned in Verse 1. These cosmic phenomena serve as clear evidence of the Creator's design and purpose.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ ۚ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ ذَٰلِكَ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ يُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that Allah hath created, in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who fear Him.","commentary":"Building upon the specific examples of the sun and moon in Verse 5, this verse expands the focus to the broader natural world. It highlights the changing of night and day, including their succession and varying lengths, as a significant sign. Furthermore, it declares that everything Allah has created in the heavens and the earth contains signs. These signs, vast and numerous in the natural world, are presented as evidence for those who are conscious of Allah and are fearful of His displeasure. It suggests that an awareness of Allah sharpens one's perception to see the divine artistry and power in creation, connecting external signs to inner reflection.","arabic":"إِنَّ فِي اخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our Signs,-","commentary":"This verse begins a contrast with those who see the signs mentioned in Verse 6. It describes people who have no hope of meeting Allah in the hereafter. Instead of looking towards the eternal future, they are content and satisfied with the temporary life of this world. The verse also points out that these individuals are those who disregard or pay no attention to the signs from Allah that are clearly evident in creation and in His revelations.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا وَرَضُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاطْمَأَنُّوا بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا غَافِلُونَ"},{"verse":"8","text":"Their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned.","commentary":"Continuing from Verse 7, this verse states the consequence for those who disregard Allah's signs, are content only with this worldly life, and have no hope of meeting Allah. Their final destination is described as the Fire. This is presented as a just outcome for the actions and choices they made in their lives, stemming from their rejection of Allah's guidance and their focus solely on the temporary world.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمُ النَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"Those who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss.","commentary":"In stark contrast to the fate described in Verses 7 and 8, this verse describes the outcome for a different group: those who believe and live a righteous life according to their faith. It explains that because of their belief, Allah will guide them, illuminating their path and enabling them to do good deeds. Their reward is described as gardens of bliss where rivers flow beneath them, painting a picture of serenity, abundance, and eternal happiness. This highlights the connection between faith, guidance from Allah, righteous actions, and the ultimate reward in the hereafter.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ ۖ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهِمُ الْأَنْهَارُ فِي جَنَّاتِ النَّعِيمِ"},{"verse":"10","text":"(This will be) their cry therein: \"Glory to Thee, O Allah!\" And \"Peace\" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: \"Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!\"","commentary":"Concluding the description of the believers' state in paradise from Verse 9, this verse illustrates the nature of their existence there. It describes their primary focus as the glorification and praise of Allah, beginning with proclaiming His perfection (\"Glory to You, O Allah!\") and ending with declaring all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all existence. It also mentions that their greeting to one another will be \"Peace,\" reflecting the atmosphere of security, harmony, and well-being they experience. This portrayal emphasizes the spiritual fulfillment and connection with the Divine that characterizes the ultimate bliss in paradise.","arabic":"دَعْوَاهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَامٌ ۚ وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good,- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction to and fro.","commentary":"This verse addresses people's attitude towards receiving good things quickly versus the delay of consequences for bad actions. It explains that if Allah were to deliver the negative results of people's wrong deeds as swiftly as they desire positive outcomes, their existence would end immediately. Instead, Allah, in His wisdom and mercy, gives time. However, the verse concludes by stating that those who do not anticipate returning to Allah and being held accountable are left to continue in their errors and straying. This sets the stage for describing the nature of such individuals in the following verses.","arabic":"وَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ الشَّرَّ اسْتِعْجَالَهُمْ بِالْخَيْرِ لَقُضِيَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَجَلُهُمْ ۖ فَنَذَرُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"When trouble toucheth a man, He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. But when We have solved his trouble, he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's mention of those who don't expect to meet Allah, this verse describes a specific aspect of their behavior. It highlights a common human tendency: when a person faces hardship, they earnestly appeal to Allah for help, regardless of their situation or physical state. But once Allah removes the trouble and grants relief, they quickly forget their plea and return to their previous ways, acting as if they never needed divine help. This inconsistent behavior, the verse explains, leads those who exceed limits to view their wrong actions as acceptable or even desirable. This contrast between desperation in need and heedlessness in ease connects back to the challenge for swift punishment mentioned implicitly in Verse 11.","arabic":"وَإِذَا مَسَّ الْإِنْسَانَ الضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنْبِهِ أَوْ قَاعِدًا أَوْ قَائِمًا فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُ مَرَّ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَدْعُنَا إِلَىٰ ضُرٍّ مَسَّهُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!","commentary":"Following the description of the current generation's behavior in Verse 12, this verse offers a historical lesson. It reminds the audience of previous communities who were destroyed because they persisted in wrongdoing and disbelieved the clear messages brought by their prophets. It explains that this destruction was Allah's consequence for their actions. This verse serves as a warning, suggesting that the behavior described in the previous verse (Verse 12) has severe historical precedents and consequences.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُوا ۙ وَجَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ وَمَا كَانُوا لِيُؤْمِنُوا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْقَوْمَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave!","commentary":"Building on the historical lesson of Verse 13, this verse clarifies the situation of the current generation. It states that Allah made them successors on the earth after the destruction of the previous, disbelieving communities. The purpose of giving them this opportunity is explicitly stated as a test: to see how they would act and behave, implying whether they would learn from the past and follow divine guidance or repeat the mistakes of those who came before. This emphasizes that life on earth is a period of trial and observation by Allah.","arabic":"ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ خَلَائِفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ لِنَنْظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: \"Bring us a reading other than this, or change this,\" Say: \"It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come).\"","commentary":"This verse returns to describing the attitude of those who do not expect to meet Allah, echoing the theme from Verse 11 and Verse 12. When Allah's clear revelations (the verses of the Qur'an) are presented to them, they demand a different scripture or that the existing one be altered. Allah directs Prophet Muhammad to respond that he cannot change the message on his own initiative because he only follows what is revealed to him. He states that he fears the severe punishment on the Day of Judgment if he were to disobey Allah in this matter. This emphasizes that the Qur'an is divine revelation, not Prophet Muhammad's own words, and therefore is not subject to alteration by him or anyone else.","arabic":"وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ ۙ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا ائْتِ بِقُرْآنٍ غَيْرِ هَٰذَا أَوْ بَدِّلْهُ ۚ قُلْ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أُبَدِّلَهُ مِنْ تِلْقَاءِ نَفْسِي ۖ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ ۖ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Say: \"If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand?\"","commentary":"Continuing the response from Verse 15, Prophet Muhammad, as directed by Allah, explains further that the recitation of the Qur'an and making it known to them is solely according to Allah's will. He reminds them that he lived among them for many years before receiving this message and asks them to reflect: if he could have produced such a message himself, why would he have waited so long? This point challenges their skepticism (as shown in Verse 15) and serves as evidence that the Qur'an is indeed a divine message, beyond human capability to produce.","arabic":"قُلْ لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا تَلَوْتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَا أَدْرَاكُمْ بِهِ ۖ فَقَدْ لَبِثْتُ فِيكُمْ عُمُرًا مِنْ قَبْلِهِ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin.","commentary":"This verse poses a rhetorical question to highlight the gravity of two major wrongdoings: inventing falsehoods and attributing them to Allah, and denying the clear signs or revelations that come from Him. It states that those who commit such acts are among the worst wrongdoers. The verse concludes with the declaration that those who persist in wrongdoing will ultimately not achieve success. This serves as a strong warning following the discussion about the divine origin of the Qur'an (Verse 15-16) and the demands made by disbelievers.","arabic":"فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"They serve, besides Allah, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with Allah.\" Say: \"Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth?- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!\"","commentary":"Returning to the practices of those who associate partners with Allah, this verse describes their worship of entities that can neither harm nor benefit them. They justify this by claiming these entities act as intermediaries or intercessors with Allah. The divine response, conveyed through the Prophet, challenges this notion with a rhetorical question implying the absurdity of claiming knowledge of intercessors that Allah Himself is unaware of in the vastness of creation. The verse then strongly declares Allah's absolute glory and His transcendence above any partners that people might associate with Him, refuting the concept of unauthorized intercession.","arabic":"وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنْفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۚ قُلْ أَتُنَبِّئُونَ اللَّهَ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Mankind was but one nation, but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them.","commentary":"This verse provides context for the divisions and disagreements among people, including the practice of associating partners with Allah mentioned in Verse 18. It states that humanity was originally united, likely upon the belief in Allah's oneness. Disagreements and divisions arose later. The verse explains that if not for a predetermined divine decree (Allah's plan or decision to postpone the final judgment or immediate consequence), their differences would have been definitively settled at that point. This highlights Allah's wisdom in allowing time for differences to play out before the ultimate reckoning.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ النَّاسُ إِلَّا أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَاخْتَلَفُوا ۚ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِنْ رَبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ فِيمَا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"They say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say: \"The Unseen is only for Allah (to know), then wait ye: I too will wait with you.\"","commentary":"Following the explanation of humanity's historical unity and later disagreements (Verse 19), this verse addresses another demand from those who disbelieve. They ask why a specific miraculous sign hasn't been sent down to Prophet Muhammad from Allah. The response, conveyed through the Prophet, states that the knowledge of the unseen (matters hidden from human perception, including when or if such a sign would be sent) belongs solely to Allah. Therefore, both the challengers and the Prophet are instructed to wait for Allah's decision regarding such matters. This response underscores the Prophet's role as a messenger who conveys divine knowledge and commands, but who does not control the timing or nature of divine signs, as this is solely within Allah's knowledge and power.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُونَ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۖ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَا الْغَيْبُ لِلَّهِ فَانْتَظِرُوا إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الْمُنْتَظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them, behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: \"Swifter to plan is Allah!\" Verily, Our messengers record all the plots that ye make!","commentary":"This verse describes a pattern often seen in human behavior. It points out that when people experience hardship or suffering and then Allah provides relief and comfort, they sometimes react by turning away from Allah's guidance and blessings. Instead of being grateful and obedient, they might scheme or twist the meaning of Allah's messages (His Signs). The verse reminds us that Allah's planning is far more powerful and swift than any human scheme. It also mentions that Allah's messengers (often understood as angels) are constantly recording everything people do, including their schemes, so nothing is hidden from Allah. This sets the stage for the vivid illustration of this human tendency in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَإِذَا أَذَقْنَا النَّاسَ رَحْمَةً مِنْ بَعْدِ ضَرَّاءَ مَسَّتْهُمْ إِذَا لَهُمْ مَكْرٌ فِي آيَاتِنَا ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ أَسْرَعُ مَكْرًا ۚ إِنَّ رُسُلَنَا يَكْتُبُونَ مَا تَمْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea; so that ye even board ships;- they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they cry unto Allah, sincerely offering (their) duty unto Him saying, \"If thou dost deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!\"","commentary":"This verse provides a powerful illustration of the human behavior described in the previous verse. It reminds us that it is Allah who makes it possible for people to travel safely by land and sea. Imagine people embarking on a ship, enjoying a smooth journey with favorable winds, feeling happy and secure. Then, suddenly, a violent storm hits. Waves crash in from every direction, and they are gripped by the fear of death, feeling completely helpless. In this moment of extreme crisis, they instinctively turn to Allah with sincere devotion, promising gratitude and obedience if they are saved. This scene highlights how hardship can strip away human arrogance and drive people to seek help from the only true source of power.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي يُسَيِّرُكُمْ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا كُنْتُمْ فِي الْفُلْكِ وَجَرَيْنَ بِهِمْ بِرِيحٍ طَيِّبَةٍ وَفَرِحُوا بِهَا جَاءَتْهَا رِيحٌ عَاصِفٌ وَجَاءَهُمُ الْمَوْجُ مِنْ كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ أُحِيطَ بِهِمْ ۙ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ لَئِنْ أَنْجَيْتَنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"But when he delivereth them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls,- an enjoyment of the life of the present: in the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did.","commentary":"Following the scene of distress and sincere prayer in the storm (Verse 22), this verse describes the surprising human reaction upon being saved. It reveals that once the danger passes and Allah delivers them from the crisis, many people immediately forget their promises and return to their arrogant ways, acting unjustly on Earth. The verse emphasizes that this rebellion and defiance ultimately harms only themselves, as their focus remains solely on the temporary pleasures of this worldly life. It concludes with a solemn reminder that everyone will eventually return to Allah, who will reveal the full reality and consequences of their actions. This serves as a warning about accountability and the fleeting nature of worldly enjoyment compared to the eternal return to Allah.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا أَنْجَاهُمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَبْغُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ ۗ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّمَا بَغْيُكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِكُمْ ۖ مَتَاعَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.","commentary":"Building upon the theme of the temporary nature of worldly enjoyment mentioned in Verse 23, this verse offers a vivid comparison to illustrate the reality of life in this world. It likens the life of this world to rain sent down by Allah, which causes the earth to burst forth with abundant crops, providing food and beauty. The land becomes adorned and its inhabitants feel confident, believing they are in complete control of their prosperity. However, the verse then describes how suddenly, by Allah's command, whether by day or night, this flourishing scene can be wiped away, like a harvest that has been mowed down, as if its beauty never existed the day before. This powerful metaphor highlights the transient nature of worldly possessions and power, contrasting with the eternal reality to which people will return (as mentioned in Verse 23), and serves as a sign for those who pause and reflect.","arabic":"إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ النَّاسُ وَالْأَنْعَامُ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَخَذَتِ الْأَرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا وَازَّيَّنَتْ وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَا أَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَا أَتَاهَا أَمْرُنَا لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيدًا كَأَنْ لَمْ تَغْنَ بِالْأَمْسِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace: He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a way that is straight.","commentary":"In contrast to the temporary and unpredictable nature of worldly life described in Verse 24, this verse presents the inviting call to a different reality: \"the Home of Peace.\" It explains that Allah invites humanity to this secure and tranquil abode (often understood as Paradise). While the worldly life is full of tests, changes, and ultimately ends, the destination Allah calls to offers true and lasting peace. The verse adds that Allah guides those He wills to the straight path, the way that leads to this Home of Peace. This guidance is based on sincerity and willingness to accept and follow His signs and messages, providing a contrast to the transient pursuits and forgetfulness illustrated in the preceding verses.","arabic":"وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ السَّلَامِ وَيَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"26","text":"To those who do right is a goodly (reward)- Yea, more (than in measure)! No darkness nor shame shall cover their faces! they are companions of the garden; they will abide therein (for aye)!","commentary":"Following the invitation in the previous verse to the \"abode of peace\" and guidance to the \"straight path,\" this verse describes the outcome for those who choose to live righteously. We believe that Allah, in His immense grace and justice, promises those who do good deeds and believe truly a wonderful reward. This reward is described not just as a fair return for their actions, but as something even more generous, exceeding what they earned. They will be protected from any hardship or humiliation on the Day of Judgment; their faces will be bright and free from distress. These are the people destined for Paradise, where they will live forever.","arabic":"لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ ۖ وَلَا يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ وَلَا ذِلَّةٌ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil: ignominy will cover their (faces): No defender will they have from (the wrath of) Allah: Their faces will be covered, as it were, with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night: they are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein (for aye)!","commentary":"In contrast to the previous verse, this verse describes the fate of those who live lives of wrongdoing and disbelief. We believe that they will receive a punishment that is a just consequence of their actions – evil for evil. Their faces will be marked by humiliation and darkness, as if covered by the deepest night, reflecting their inner state and the severity of their situation. We believe they will find no one to protect them from the consequences of their choices before Allah. These are the ones destined for the Fire, where they will reside permanently. These two verses together paint a picture of the two possible outcomes based on one's life choices and beliefs.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَسَبُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ جَزَاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ بِمِثْلِهَا وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ ۖ مَا لَهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ ۖ كَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ قِطَعًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ مُظْلِمًا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"One day shall We gather them all together. Then shall We say to those who joined gods (with Us): \"To your place! ye and those ye joined as 'partners' We shall separate them, and their \"Partners\" shall say: \"It was not us that ye worshipped!","commentary":"Moving towards describing the Day of Judgment mentioned in the previous verses, this verse depicts a scene where everyone will be gathered. Then, Allah will address those who associated others with Him in worship. These people and the beings they worshipped (referred to here as their 'partners' or 'associates') will be told to stay put. Then, a separation will occur, and the beings they worshipped will speak, disowning the act of worship and stating clearly that they were not the ones being worshipped. This scene underscores the futility of worshipping anything other than Allah.","arabic":"وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا مَكَانَكُمْ أَنْتُمْ وَشُرَكَاؤُكُمْ ۚ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ وَقَالَ شُرَكَاؤُهُمْ مَا كُنْتُمْ إِيَّانَا تَعْبُدُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"\"Enough is Allah for a witness between us and you: we certainly knew nothing of your worship of us!\"","commentary":"Continuing the scene from the previous verse, the beings who were falsely worshipped declare to their former worshippers that Allah is sufficient as a witness between them. They emphasize that they were completely unaware of being worshipped in that manner. This further highlights the powerlessness of these so-called partners and underscores the complete lack of justification for directing worship or devotion towards them instead of or alongside Allah.","arabic":"فَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِنْ كُنَّا عَنْ عِبَادَتِكُمْ لَغَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"There will every soul prove (the fruits of) the deeds it sent before: they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.","commentary":"Following the dramatic scene of confrontation, this verse describes the final outcome. At that point, every individual soul will fully understand the consequences of their actions in this life. All will be returned to Allah, their true and ultimate Lord. Any false beliefs or invented ideas about partners or intercessors will vanish completely, leaving those who held them with nothing to rely on. This verse emphasizes personal accountability and the ultimate reality of returning solely to Allah.","arabic":"هُنَالِكَ تَبْلُو كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا أَسْلَفَتْ ۚ وَرُدُّوا إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَاهُمُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"Say: \"Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? or who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs?\" They will soon say, \"Allah\". Say, \"will ye not then show piety (to Him)?\"","commentary":"Shifting back from the Day of Judgment to this life, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is instructed to ask the people questions about the clear signs of Allah's power around them. These questions highlight fundamental aspects of existence that everyone witnesses: sustenance from the heavens (like rain) and the earth (like plants), the functioning of senses like hearing and sight, the constant cycle of life coming from seemingly lifeless things and death occurring for the living, and the overall organization and regulation of all affairs in the universe. It is expected that anyone reflecting honestly would acknowledge that only Allah is capable of these things. If they acknowledge this, the verse then challenges them: why, knowing this, do they not act with reverence and consciousness of Him? This verse uses observations from the natural world to build a logical argument for acknowledging Allah's unique power, setting the stage for the next point.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ يَرْزُقُكُمْ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّنْ يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَنْ يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَنْ يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"Such is Allah, your real Cherisher and Sustainer: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? How then are ye turned away?","commentary":"Building on the acknowledgements expected from the questions in the previous verse, this verse states that the One who does all those things (provides, controls senses, manages life/death, regulates affairs) is truly Allah, the ultimate Lord and Sustainer. The verse then presents a stark choice: once the truth is evident, anything else is simply error. It challenges the listener, asking why they would turn away from this clear truth. This verse reinforces the conclusion drawn from the evidence presented in verse 31.","arabic":"فَذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ الْحَقُّ ۖ فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ الْحَقِّ إِلَّا الضَّلَالُ ۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"Thus is the word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel: Verily they will not believe.","commentary":"This verse explains that because certain people deliberately reject the truth that is made clear to them (as highlighted in the preceding verses), a consequence is determined for them: they will not believe. This isn't a compulsion from Allah preventing them from believing, but rather a result of their own stubborn turning away and rejection of the clear signs and logical arguments presented. Their persistent rebellion against the truth confirms the reality of the consequences that are set for those who choose disbelief.","arabic":"كَذَٰلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ فَسَقُوا أَنَّهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"Say: \"Of your 'partners', can any originate creation and repeat it?\" Say: \"It is Allah Who originates creation and repeats it: then how are ye deluded away (from the truth)?\"","commentary":"Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is instructed to pose another challenge, this time focusing on the power of creation and recreation (bringing things back to life, which includes resurrection). The question is directed at the 'partners' that people associate with Allah in worship, asking if any of them possess the power to originate creation in the first place, let alone repeat it after death. The verse immediately provides the undeniable answer: it is only Allah who initiates creation and has the power to bring it back again. The question then arises: given this clear reality about who has the ultimate power over life and existence, how is it that they are so deceived and turned away from this obvious truth? This continues the comparison between Allah's unique power and the powerlessness of any other being.","arabic":"قُلْ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَكَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ ۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"Say: \"Of your 'partners' is there any that can give any guidance towards truth?\" Say: \"It is Allah Who gives guidance towards truth, is then He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? what then is the matter with you? How judge ye?\"","commentary":"Following the challenge regarding creation and recreation in the previous verse, this verse presents another challenge focusing on guidance. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is to ask if any of the beings people associate with Allah have the ability to truly guide others to the truth. The clear answer provided is that only Allah is the source of true guidance. The verse then prompts a logical reflection: who is more deserving of being followed – the One who Himself guides to the truth, or someone (or something) that cannot even find the right path unless guided by another? This question highlights the illogic of following false deities or leaders who are themselves dependent and fallible. The verse concludes by questioning their judgment, asking what is wrong with them and how they could possibly conclude that anyone other than Allah, the ultimate source of guidance, is worthy of being followed. This verse emphasizes Allah's unique role as the only true Guide and calls for people to use their reason to recognize this.","arabic":"قُلْ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَكَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ ۗ أَفَمَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَنْ يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّنْ لَا يَهِدِّي إِلَّا أَنْ يُهْدَىٰ ۖ فَمَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"But most of them follow nothing but fancy: truly fancy can be of no avail against truth. Verily Allah is well aware of all that they do.","commentary":"This verse explains why many people turn away from the truth, despite acknowledging the fundamental facts about the universe that were discussed in previous verses (like who provides sustenance, controls senses, and regulates affairs). It states that most of them do not base their beliefs or actions on certain knowledge or solid facts, but rather on assumptions and guesswork. Such assumptions cannot stand up against the truth revealed by Allah. The verse concludes by reminding everyone that Allah is fully aware of everything they do. This serves as a transition, highlighting the flawed basis of their rejection before discussing the divine source of the Qur'an.","arabic":"وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ إِلَّا ظَنًّا ۚ إِنَّ الظَّنَّ لَا يُغْنِي مِنَ الْحَقِّ شَيْئًا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds.","commentary":"Following the mention that people rely on assumptions rather than truth (Verse 36), this verse addresses the nature of the Qur'an itself. It declares emphatically that the Qur'an could not possibly have been created or written by anyone other than Allah. It confirms the core messages of earlier divine revelations given to previous prophets and provides a clear, complete explanation of the divine message – a message that is undoubtedly from Allah, the Sustainer and Controller of all creation.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنُ أَنْ يُفْتَرَىٰ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنْ تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"38","text":"Or do they say, \"He forged it\"? say: \"Bring then a Sura like unto it, and call (to your aid) anyone you can besides Allah, if it be ye speak the truth!\"","commentary":"If, despite the clear declaration in the previous verse (Verse 37) that the Qur'an is from Allah, they still claim that Prophet Muhammad invented it, this verse presents a direct challenge. It instructs the Prophet to tell them to try to produce even a single chapter (Sura) similar to any chapter in the Qur'an. They are challenged to call upon anyone or anything they wish to help them in this task, besides Allah, if their claim that the Qur'an is a human invention is true. This challenge underscores the unique, divine nature of the Qur'an.","arabic":"أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۖ قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!","commentary":"This verse explains why they cannot meet the challenge presented in Verse 38. It states that their rejection is based on ignorance and haste. They reject the Qur'an and the truths it contains, including the unseen realities and future events it describes, without truly understanding it or waiting for its full meaning to become clear. This hasty rejection, based on their limited understanding and preferences, mirrors the behavior of people in previous generations who also rejected divine messages. The verse warns them to consider the fate of those earlier communities who chose disbelief, implying a similar outcome for them if they persist.","arabic":"بَلْ كَذَّبُوا بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُوا بِعِلْمِهِ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۖ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"Of them there are some who believe therein, and some who do not: and thy Lord knoweth best those who are out for mischief.","commentary":"Building on the description of their rejection (Verse 39), this verse points out that not everyone among them reacts in the same way. It acknowledges that among the people addressed by the message of the Qur'an, there is a division: some choose to believe in it, while others do not. Allah is fully aware of those who deliberately choose to create disorder or cause harm through their rejection and opposition to the truth. In the context of the message, this \"mischief\" refers to the disruption and corruption that results from turning away from divine guidance.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ ۚ وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"41","text":"If they charge thee with falsehood, say: \"My work to me, and yours to you! ye are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what ye do!\"","commentary":"Following the statement that some accept and some reject the message (Verse 40), this verse gives Prophet Muhammad guidance on how to respond when they reject and accuse him of falsehood. He is instructed to clearly separate himself from their actions and beliefs, stating that he is responsible for his own actions and they are responsible for theirs. This declaration emphasizes individual accountability before Allah. It signifies that after the message has been clearly conveyed, each person's choice determines their own destiny, and the Prophet is absolved of their rejection.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُلْ لِي عَمَلِي وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ ۖ أَنْتُمْ بَرِيئُونَ مِمَّا أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَا بَرِيءٌ مِمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"42","text":"Among them are some who (pretend to) listen to thee: But canst thou make the deaf to hear,- even though they are without understanding?","commentary":"This verse describes the attitude of some who outwardly appear to listen to the Prophet when he recites the Qur'an or explains the message. However, it points out that their hearts and minds are closed to the truth. Using the analogy of physical deafness, it questions whether the Prophet can make those hear who are unwilling to understand or accept, even though they may be physically present and seeming to listen. This highlights that their lack of response is a deliberate choice, not a result of the message being unclear. This prepares the way for the next verse, which uses a similar analogy.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ ۚ أَفَأَنْتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ وَلَوْ كَانُوا لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"And among them are some who look at thee: but canst thou guide the blind,- even though they will not see?","commentary":"Continuing the theme from Verse 42 about their deliberate unresponsiveness, this verse uses the analogy of physical blindness. It describes others who outwardly look at the Prophet, observing him, but their inner perception is closed to the truth he represents and the guidance he brings. The verse asks rhetorically if the Prophet can guide those who are wilfully blind, even though they are physically capable of seeing. This further emphasizes that their rejection is due to their own choice to close their hearts and minds, despite the clear signs before them.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْكَ ۚ أَفَأَنْتَ تَهْدِي الْعُمْيَ وَلَوْ كَانُوا لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: It is man that wrongs his own soul.","commentary":"This verse provides the reason and justification for the consequences faced by those who reject the truth, as described through the analogies of deafness and blindness in the preceding verses (42-43). It asserts the absolute justice of Allah, stating that Allah never wrongs anyone in the slightest degree. Instead, any hardship or suffering experienced by individuals, particularly the negative consequences of rejecting guidance, is a direct result of their own actions and choices – they wrong themselves by choosing disbelief and turning away from the path that leads to well-being. This sets the stage for the description of accountability on the Day of Judgment in the following verse.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا وَلَٰكِنَّ النَّاسَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.","commentary":"Following the statement in Verse 44 that people wrong themselves through their choices, this verse paints a picture of the Day of Judgment when everyone will be gathered before Allah. The striking contrast is made between the perceived length of their worldly life and the reality of eternity; their life in this world will seem incredibly short, perhaps like spending just an hour of a day, during which they barely had time to fully know each other before facing the ultimate reality. The verse concludes by stating with certainty that those who denied the reality of meeting Allah for judgment and refused to accept the true guidance offered to them will find themselves utterly lost and facing the consequences of their choices.","arabic":"وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Whether We show thee (realised in thy life-time) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (Before that),- in any case, to Us is their return: ultimately Allah is witness, to all that they do.","commentary":"This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, stating that the outcome for those who reject Allah's message rests entirely with Allah. Whether Allah chooses to show the Prophet some of the consequences promised to these people during his lifetime, or if the Prophet passes away before that happens, everyone will ultimately return to Allah. The verse emphasizes that Allah is aware of everything they do. This connects to the previous verse, which depicted the short feeling of worldly life when faced with the reality of the Day of Judgment, reinforcing that the final destination and accountability are with Allah, regardless of what happens in this life.","arabic":"وَإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ الَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ اللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"To every people (was sent) a messenger: when their messenger comes (before them), the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.","commentary":"This verse establishes a fundamental principle: Allah has sent a messenger to every community throughout history. The purpose of these messengers is to convey Allah's message and guidance. When the messenger has fulfilled their role and the people have had the opportunity to understand the message, judgment will be passed on them. The verse assures that this judgment will be conducted with absolute fairness, and no one will be treated unjustly. This highlights Allah's justice and the clarity of the message sent to each people before any reckoning occurs.","arabic":"وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولٌ ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"They say: \"When will this promise come to pass,- if ye speak the truth?\"","commentary":"Following the mention of judgment in the previous verse, this verse presents a challenge from those who disbelieve. They question the timing of the promised consequences or punishment mentioned by the messenger, asking for it to happen immediately if the message is true. This is a common response from those who doubt or mock the warnings about the future. This verse sets the stage for the response that clarifies that the timing of these events is solely with Allah.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"Say: \"I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as Allah willeth. To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation).\"","commentary":"This verse provides a direct response to the challenge in the previous verse about the timing of the promised events. It instructs the Prophet to state clearly that he has no control over bringing harm or benefit, not even to himself, except as Allah wills. This emphasizes that the messenger's role is to convey the message, and power belongs only to Allah. The verse then explains that every community and every individual has an appointed time for judgment or consequence. When that set time arrives, it cannot be delayed or hastened by anyone, reinforcing Allah's absolute control over destiny and timing.","arabic":"قُلْ لَا أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ ۗ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ ۚ إِذَا جَاءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَلَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً ۖ وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"Say: \"Do ye see,- if His punishment should come to you by night or by day,- what portion of it would the sinners wish to hasten?","commentary":"Building on the concept of a fixed, inevitable time for consequences (V49), this verse shifts tone to warn those who challenged the timing. It asks them to consider the reality of Allah's punishment arriving unexpectedly, whether by night or day. The question posed is rhetorical, highlighting the absurdity of wishing to hasten something so dreadful. It prompts reflection on the severe nature of the punishment that no one would truly desire to speed up once its reality is contemplated.","arabic":"قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُهُ بَيَاتًا أَوْ نَهَارًا مَاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"\"Would ye then believe in it at last, when it actually cometh to pass? (It will then be said): 'Ah! now? and ye wanted (aforetime) to hasten it on!'","commentary":"Continuing the scenario from the previous verse, this verse depicts the moment the punishment actually arrives. It questions whether they will finally believe *then*, when it's too late. The verse includes a poignant rebuke, as if addressing them at that moment: \"Now? And you wanted to rush it before!\" This illustrates the futility of delaying belief and highlights the regret that will be felt by those who mocked or doubted when faced with the unavoidable reality.","arabic":"أَثُمَّ إِذَا مَا وَقَعَ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ ۚ آلْآنَ وَقَدْ كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"\"At length will be said to the wrong-doers: 'Taste ye the enduring punishment! ye get but the recompense of what ye earned!'\"","commentary":"Concluding the vivid scene of judgment and punishment, this verse explicitly states the fate of those described as \"wrong-doers\" or \"those who did evil.\" They will be told to experience a lasting punishment. The verse clarifies that this suffering is not arbitrary but is the just consequence and recompense for their actions in their worldly life. This reinforces the theme of accountability and divine justice mentioned in earlier verses.","arabic":"ثُمَّ قِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا ذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الْخُلْدِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"They seek to be informed by thee: \"Is that true?\" Say: \"Aye! by my Lord! it is the very truth! and ye cannot frustrate it!\"","commentary":"Returning to the interaction in this life, the verse describes people asking the Prophet whether these warnings about judgment and punishment are truly factual. The response is an emphatic affirmation, sworn by Allah, stating that it is indeed the absolute truth. The verse adds that they have no power to escape or prevent it. This strong confirmation underscores the certainty of the consequences described in the preceding verses and emphasizes Allah's ultimate power from which no one can flee.","arabic":"وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ ۖ قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّي إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ ۖ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"Every soul that hath sinned, if it possessed all that is on earth, would fain give it in ransom: They would declare (their) repentance when they see the penalty: but the judgment between them will be with justice, and no wrong will be done unto them.","commentary":"Following the assertion of the truth and inevitability of the consequences (V53), this verse paints a powerful picture of a soul that has done wrong on the Day of Judgment. It describes that such a soul, if it owned everything on Earth, would gladly offer it as a ransom to escape the punishment. It also mentions that they would show repentance upon seeing the penalty. However, the verse concludes by reiterating that judgment will be passed justly, and no one will be wronged, implying that such a last-minute offer or repentance at that stage will not be accepted, as each person is judged fairly based on their deeds.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِكُلِّ نَفْسٍ ظَلَمَتْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لَافْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ وَأَسَرُّوا النَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُا الْعَذَابَ ۖ وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"55","text":"Is it not (the case) that to Allah belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth? Is it not (the case) that Allah's promise is assuredly true? Yet most of them understand not.","commentary":"This verse makes a fundamental declaration about Allah's sovereignty and the certainty of His promises, which relates back to the discussions of judgment and accountability. It begins by stating that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah, emphasizing His supreme ownership and control. It then directly asserts that Allah's promise is undoubtedly true. Despite these clear realities, the verse notes with sadness that most people do not grasp or understand this truth, which is why they doubt or reject the messages brought by the messengers.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"It is He Who giveth life and who taketh it, and to Him shall ye all be brought back.","commentary":"This verse reminds us of Allah's absolute power over life and death. It tells us that it is only Allah who grants life and takes it away. This is a fundamental truth that everyone experiences in their lifetime. The verse concludes by stating that to Allah we will all return, emphasizing that life in this world is temporary and our ultimate destination is back to Him for accountability. This connects to the previous verses which spoke about the promise of return to Allah and the consequences of denying that reality.","arabic":"هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"O mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a Mercy.","commentary":"Addressing all of humanity, this verse introduces the Qur'an as a divine message. It describes the Qur'an as \"a direction,\" meaning a guidance or instruction from Allah, our Sustainer. It is also described as \"a healing for the diseases in your hearts.\" These diseases can be things like doubt, ignorance, and negative traits. For those who embrace belief, the Qur'an serves as both guidance, showing the right path in life, and a mercy, bringing ease and blessings from Allah. This verse highlights the beneficial nature of the divine message for everyone, especially those who are receptive to it.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُمْ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَشِفَاءٌ لِمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"Say: \"In the bounty of Allah. And in His Mercy,- in that let them rejoice\": that is better than the (wealth) they hoard.","commentary":"Following the description of the Qur'an as guidance and mercy (Allah's bounty and grace), this verse instructs the Prophet to tell people to rejoice in these divine gifts. It clarifies that having guidance and mercy from Allah is far more valuable and a greater reason for joy than accumulating wealth and possessions in this world. This contrasts spiritual values with material ones, suggesting that true happiness and fulfillment come from connecting with Allah and following His guidance, rather than from worldly riches.","arabic":"قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"Say: \"See ye what things Allah hath sent down to you for sustenance? Yet ye hold forbidden some things thereof and (some things) lawful.\" Say: \"Hath Allah indeed permitted you, or do ye invent (things) to attribute to Allah?\"","commentary":"This verse challenges those who arbitrarily decide what is permissible and what is forbidden, especially regarding the provisions Allah has provided. It points out that all sustenance comes from Allah, yet some people take it upon themselves to declare certain things lawful or unlawful without any divine basis. The verse poses a direct question: Did Allah authorize you to make these distinctions, or are you simply fabricating lies and attributing them to Him? This emphasizes that the authority to legislate is solely with Allah.","arabic":"قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ رِزْقٍ فَجَعَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ حَرَامًا وَحَلَالًا قُلْ آللَّهُ أَذِنَ لَكُمْ ۖ أَمْ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"And what think those who invent lies against Allah, of the Day of Judgment? Verily Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's point about inventing laws against Allah, this verse warns about the consequences on the Day of Judgment for those who fabricate falsehoods about Him. It prompts them to consider what they expect their fate to be when they stand before Allah after denying His authority. Despite this warning, the verse also reminds us of Allah's immense generosity to humanity, providing countless blessings. However, it notes with sadness that many people are ungrateful for this bounty, often demonstrated by their disregard for His guidance and their attribution of false ideas to Him.","arabic":"وَمَا ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"61","text":"In whatever business thou mayest be, and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the Qur'an,- and whatever deed ye (mankind) may be doing,- We are witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein. Nor is hidden from thy Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. And not the least and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear record.","commentary":"This powerful verse speaks about Allah's constant awareness and knowledge of everything. It assures Prophet Muhammad (and by extension, all believers) that Allah is a witness to every action they undertake, whether it is a major task, reciting the Qur'an, or any other deed. It extends this to all of humanity, stating that Allah witnesses whatever people are doing, even when they are fully absorbed in it. The verse then emphasizes the absolute comprehensiveness of Allah's knowledge, stating that nothing, no matter how small (even the weight of an atom), on Earth or in the heavens, is hidden from Him. Furthermore, everything, from the smallest to the largest, is meticulously recorded. This serves as a reminder of accountability and Allah's perfect justice, reinforcing the warnings in the preceding verses about judgment.","arabic":"وَمَا تَكُونُ فِي شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُو مِنْهُ مِنْ قُرْآنٍ وَلَا تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلَّا كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ ۚ وَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْ رَبِّكَ مِنْ مِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَا أَصْغَرَ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرَ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Behold! verily on the friends of Allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve;","commentary":"Following the reminder of Allah's pervasive knowledge and accountability, this verse offers comfort and assurance to those who are close to Allah. It declares that the true \"friends of Allah\" will experience no fear for the future and no grief over the past or present. This state of peace and security comes from their strong connection with Allah and their trust in His care, which was alluded to in the previous verse highlighting Allah's constant witnessing.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَاءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil;-","commentary":"This verse defines who the \"friends of Allah\" mentioned in the previous verse are. They are identified by two key qualities: first, they believe in Allah, His messengers, and His message (like the Qur'an mentioned earlier); and second, they are consistently mindful of Allah and strive to avoid displeasing Him or doing wrong. It's this combination of inner faith and outer righteous conduct that brings them into a state of closeness with Allah, leading to the absence of fear and grief promised in verse 62.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَكَانُوا يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present and in the Hereafter; no change can there be in the words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme felicity.","commentary":"This verse expands on the blessings for the \"friends of Allah\" defined in verse 63. It declares that they have received good news, both in this life and in the eternal life to come. These glad tidings are sure and unchanging because they are Allah's promises, and His words never change. The verse emphasizes that this state of receiving good news and assurance, encompassing both worlds, is the ultimate success and happiness, far surpassing any worldly achievement or possession mentioned earlier.","arabic":"لَهُمُ الْبُشْرَىٰ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۚ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ"},{"verse":"65","text":"Let not their speech grieve thee: for all power and honour belong to Allah: It is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).","commentary":"This verse offers solace and strength to Prophet Muhammad, addressing potential grief caused by the negative speech or opposition from disbelievers mentioned in earlier verses (like those inventing lies in verse 60). It reminds him not to be saddened because all true power and honor belong solely to Allah. This implies that any apparent power or influence of those who oppose the truth is temporary and ultimately insignificant compared to Allah's might. Furthermore, it reassures the Prophet that Allah hears everything they say and knows all their intentions and actions, providing complete protection and support.","arabic":"وَلَا يَحْزُنْكَ قَوْلُهُمْ ۘ إِنَّ الْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا ۚ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ"},{"verse":"66","text":"Behold! verily to Allah belong all creatures, in the heavens and on earth. What do they follow who worship as His \"partners\" other than Allah? They follow nothing but fancy, and they do nothing but lie.","commentary":"This verse reminds us that truly, everything that exists in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah. He is the absolute owner and controller of all creation. Following on from the previous verse (65) which emphasizes that all might and glory belong to Allah, this verse further clarifies His unique status by stating that everything and everyone is His possession. It then questions the actions of those who worship or associate \"partners\" with Allah. It explains that when people turn to other beings or things besides Allah, they are not following any real truth or reality. Instead, they are merely following assumptions, groundless ideas, and fabricating falsehoods about the nature of existence and divinity. Their claims that these partners have any power or share in Allah's authority are simply untrue.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ ۚ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"He it is That hath made you the night that ye may rest therein, and the day to make things visible (to you). Verily in this are signs for those who listen (to His Message).","commentary":"Following the declaration in the previous verse (66) that everything belongs to Allah, this verse offers concrete examples from the universe to illustrate His power and sole control. It highlights Allah's creation of the night for rest and the day for visibility and activity. These are fundamental rhythms of life that directly impact human existence. The verse points out that in these phenomena – the cycle of night and day, and their perfect alignment with human needs – there are clear signs demonstrating the power and wisdom of the One who created them. These signs are evident for anyone who truly listens and reflects upon the message brought by Allah's messengers. This serves as further evidence supporting the truth asserted in the preceding verse about Allah's sole ownership and control.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ لِتَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ وَالنَّهَارَ مُبْصِرًا ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"They say: \"Allah hath begotten a son!\" - Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! No warrant have ye for this! say ye about Allah what ye know not?","commentary":"This verse directly addresses a false claim made by some people – the assertion that Allah has a son. Immediately after stating the signs of Allah's power in the universe (Verse 67), the Qur'an declares that Allah is far above such notions. It emphasizes His absolute perfection and self-sufficiency. He does not need anything or anyone, including offspring, because everything in the heavens and on earth already belongs to Him and is under His control. Unlike humans who may need children for continuity, support, or help, Allah is eternal and all-powerful, with no needs or deficiencies. The verse challenges those who make this claim, stating they have no evidence or basis for it. It questions why they would speak about Allah in such a way, attributing things to Him without any true knowledge, especially after the universe itself provides clear signs of His unique, absolute nature.","arabic":"قَالُوا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا ۗ سُبْحَانَهُ ۖ هُوَ الْغَنِيُّ ۖ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ إِنْ عِنْدَكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ بِهَٰذَا ۚ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"Say: \"Those who invent a lie against Allah will never prosper.\"","commentary":"Building upon the rejection of false claims about Allah in the previous verse (68), this verse states the inevitable consequence for those who fabricate lies against Him. It declares clearly that such people will never achieve true prosperity. This is a direct warning that misleading others about Allah's nature or attributing falsehoods to Him leads ultimately to failure, not success.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"A little enjoyment in this world!- and then, to Us will be their return, then shall We make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemies.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the nature of the \"prosperity\" denied to those who lie about Allah in the previous verse (69). It explains that while they might experience some temporary and limited enjoyment in this earthly life, this is fleeting. Their ultimate destiny is to return to Allah. Because of their disbelief and the grave offense of inventing lies against Allah, they will face a severe punishment in the hereafter. This highlights the contrast between short-lived worldly pleasure and the lasting consequences of their actions in the afterlife. It underscores that true prosperity is not found in temporary worldly gains gained while opposing truth, but in a favorable outcome in the eternal life with Allah.","arabic":"مَتَاعٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"Say: \"Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth\"; but neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not.","commentary":"This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to tell people to reflect on everything in the heavens and on the earth. The universe is full of signs that point to Allah's existence, power, and wisdom. There are also messengers and divine messages sent as warnings and guidance. However, the verse emphasizes that observing these signs and receiving these warnings are not beneficial for those who have chosen not to believe. Their hearts and minds are closed off, preventing them from receiving guidance from these signs and warnings, no matter how clear they are.","arabic":"قُلِ انْظُرُوا مَاذَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَمَا تُغْنِي الْآيَاتُ وَالنُّذُرُ عَنْ قَوْمٍ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"Do they then expect (any thing) but (what happened in) the days of the men who passed away before them? Say: \"Wait ye then: for I, too, will wait with you.\"","commentary":"Following the point in the previous verse that signs and warnings do not benefit those who refuse to believe, this verse asks a question: What are such people expecting? It implies that their path of rejecting truth leads to the same outcome as previous communities who similarly rejected the messages brought by earlier prophets. The history of these past nations, as mentioned earlier in the Sura (like the stories of Prophet Noah and Prophet Moses), shows that rejection of divine guidance often led to consequences determined by Allah. The verse concludes with a declaration from the Prophet: \"Wait ye then: for I, too, will wait with you.\" This signifies that both sides are awaiting the outcome that Allah has decreed based on their actions and choices.","arabic":"فَهَلْ يَنْتَظِرُونَ إِلَّا مِثْلَ أَيَّامِ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْا مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ قُلْ فَانْتَظِرُوا إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الْمُنْتَظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"In the end We deliver Our messengers and those who believe: Thus is it fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe!","commentary":"This verse concludes the discussion initiated in the previous two verses and reinforces the lessons from the historical accounts mentioned earlier in the Sura. It states a principle established by Allah: ultimately, Allah saves His messengers and those who believe in them and follow their guidance. This is presented not just as an event but as a consistent pattern or a commitment from Allah. It confirms that belief leads to salvation and deliverance, contrasting with the consequences faced by those who reject the truth as highlighted in the previous verse. This verse provides reassurance for believers and underscores the importance of faith in facing challenges.","arabic":"ثُمَّ نُنَجِّي رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ حَقًّا عَلَيْنَا نُنْجِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his people: \"O my people, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and commemorate the signs of Allah,- yet I put my trust in Allah. Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite.","commentary":"Following a reminder about the fate of those who invent lies against Allah and associate partners with Him, this verse begins relating the story of Prophet Noah as an example. Prophet Noah addresses his people, acknowledging their difficulty in accepting his presence and his reminders about Allah's signs. He declares that, despite their opposition, he places his complete trust in Allah alone. He then issues a challenge, telling them to gather their allies and decide on a clear plan against him, without any hesitation or delay, and carry it out. This challenge demonstrates Prophet Noah's unwavering faith and reliance on Allah's support, highlighting the power of faith against seemingly superior forces.","arabic":"وَاتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ نُوحٍ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ إِنْ كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَقَامِي وَتَذْكِيرِي بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَعَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ فَأَجْمِعُوا أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَاءَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً ثُمَّ اقْضُوا إِلَيَّ وَلَا تُنْظِرُونِ"},{"verse":"72","text":"\"But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to Allah's will (in Islam).\"","commentary":"Continuing his address to his people, Prophet Noah clarifies his motivation. He tells them that if they reject his message, it will not affect him personally or financially, as he has asked for no reward from them. His compensation is due solely from Allah. He emphasizes that his stance is not based on personal gain but on the command he has received to be fully submitted to Allah's will. This reinforces the sincerity of his call and his complete dedication to his mission, regardless of their response.","arabic":"فَإِنْ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَمَا سَأَلْتُكُمْ مِنْ أَجْرٍ ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)!","commentary":"This verse describes the direct consequence of Prophet Noah's people's rejection mentioned in the previous verses. They chose to disbelieve him. As a result, Allah saved Prophet Noah and the believers who were with him in the Ark. The commentary highlights that this small group was then made the successors on the earth, while the large numbers of disbelievers, who rejected Allah's signs, were destroyed by the flood. The verse concludes with a powerful call to reflect on the fate of those who were warned but ignored the message, serving as a stark lesson for others.","arabic":"فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَمَنْ مَعَهُ فِي الْفُلْكِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ خَلَائِفَ وَأَغْرَقْنَا الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا ۖ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُنْذَرِينَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Then after him We sent (many) messengers to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors.","commentary":"Following the account of Prophet Noah and his people, this verse provides a brief overview of subsequent messengers sent to various communities. It states that these messengers also brought clear signs and evidence of the truth. However, the peoples often refused to believe, often because they held onto the same disbelief that previous generations had adopted. The verse explains this by stating that this is how Allah seals the hearts of those who transgress. This is understood as a consequence of their persistent refusal to use their ability to understand and accept the truth, leading their hearts to become unreceptive to guidance. This continues the theme of past communities and their response to divine messages, setting the stage for the story of Prophet Moses.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ رُسُلًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَاءُوهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَمَا كَانُوا لِيُؤْمِنُوا بِمَا كَذَّبُوا بِهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ الْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a people in sin.","commentary":"Continuing the pattern of sending messengers described in the previous verse, this verse introduces Prophet Moses and his brother, Prophet Aaron, who were sent by Allah with signs to Pharaoh and his leading figures. The commentary emphasizes that Pharaoh and his chiefs reacted with arrogance. Their disbelief was rooted in their sinfulness and oppressive nature. This sets the stage for their confrontation, highlighting the character of those who would oppose the message.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ بِآيَاتِنَا فَاسْتَكْبَرُوا وَكَانُوا قَوْمًا مُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: \"This is indeed evident sorcery!\"","commentary":"Following the arrival of Prophet Moses and Prophet Aaron with Allah's signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs (mentioned in the previous verse), this verse describes their reaction. When the truth from Allah reached them, they immediately dismissed it as \"evident sorcery.\" The commentary notes the emphasis on the truth coming \"from Us\" (Allah) to highlight the severity of their offense in labeling it as sorcery. This response demonstrates their refusal to acknowledge the divine nature of the signs and echoes similar reactions from other communities who denied their prophets.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ عِنْدِنَا قَالُوا إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسِحْرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"77","text":"Said Moses: \"Say ye (this) about the truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper.\"","commentary":"In response to Pharaoh and his chiefs calling the truth \"sorcery\" (as stated in the previous verse), Prophet Moses confronts them directly. He questions their assertion, asking if they truly believe this truth, which has undeniably reached them, is sorcery. He points out that true divine guidance cannot be confused with sorcery, which deals in trickery and deception and has no noble purpose or lasting success. This challenges their false accusation and highlights the fundamental difference between Allah's message and human manipulation.","arabic":"قَالَ مُوسَىٰ أَتَقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَاءَكُمْ ۖ أَسِحْرٌ هَٰذَا وَلَا يُفْلِحُ السَّاحِرُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"They said: \"Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you!\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Moses' challenge regarding their accusation of sorcery, Pharaoh's chiefs reveal their true motivations for rejecting the message. They accuse Prophet Moses and Prophet Aaron of seeking to divert them from their ancestral traditions and customs, ultimately aiming for power and prominence in the land themselves. They categorically state their refusal to believe. The commentary explains that this fear of losing power and abandoning inherited ways is a common motive for those in authority who oppose the truth when it challenges their established order.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا الْكِبْرِيَاءُ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"Said Pharaoh: \"Bring me every sorcerer well versed.\"","commentary":"After the confrontation where Prophet Moses and Prophet Aaron were accused of sorcery and the real motives of the chiefs were revealed (in the preceding verses), Pharaoh decides on a course of action. He commands that all skilled sorcerers be brought to him. The commentary indicates that Pharaoh likely saw this as a way to challenge Prophet Moses directly, hoping to prove that Prophet Moses' signs were merely a superior form of sorcery, thereby discrediting his message and protecting the authority of Pharaoh and his nobles.","arabic":"وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ائْتُونِي بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ"},{"verse":"80","text":"When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: \"Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw!\"","commentary":"Following Pharaoh's command to gather the sorcerers (mentioned in the previous verse), they arrive. This verse describes the beginning of the direct confrontation. Prophet Moses addresses the assembled sorcerers, giving them the opportunity to display their abilities first by saying, \"Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw!\" This indicates his confidence in the truth of his message and sets the stage for the clear distinction that would be made between genuine divine signs and human sorcery.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَاءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالَ لَهُمْ مُوسَىٰ أَلْقُوا مَا أَنْتُمْ مُلْقُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"When they had had their throw, Moses said: \"What ye have brought is sorcery: Allah will surely make it of no effect: for Allah prospereth not the work of those who make mischief.","commentary":"This verse describes a moment during the confrontation between Prophet Moses and the sorcerers gathered by Pharaoh. After the sorcerers performed their magic, Prophet Moses declared that what they presented was mere sorcery, not a divine miracle. He asserted that Allah, the One True God, would nullify their sorcery because Allah does not support the actions of those who cause harm or corruption. This declaration highlights the difference between genuine divine signs brought by a prophet and the deceptive illusions of sorcery.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا أَلْقَوْا قَالَ مُوسَىٰ مَا جِئْتُمْ بِهِ السِّحْرُ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"\"And Allah by His words doth prove and establish His truth, however much the sinners may hate it!\"","commentary":"Following his statement about the sorcery being ineffective, Prophet Moses further clarified that Allah's words, His revelations and commands, are what establish and uphold the truth. This truth will always prevail, regardless of how much those who are astray may dislike it. This verse reinforces the power of Allah's truth to overcome falsehood, directly connecting to the previous verse's statement about sorcery being brought to nothing.","arabic":"وَيُحِقُّ اللَّهُ الْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُجْرِمُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds.","commentary":"Despite Prophet Moses presenting clear signs and truth, this verse explains that only a small number of people from his own community, the Children of Israel, believed in him at this time. The primary reason for others not believing was their intense fear of persecution from Pharaoh and his powerful leaders. Pharaoh was indeed a mighty ruler known for his oppressive and excessive behavior, which created a climate of fear that prevented many from accepting the message. This verse sets the stage for Prophet Moses’ response to this fearful situation in the following verse.","arabic":"فَمَا آمَنَ لِمُوسَىٰ إِلَّا ذُرِّيَّةٌ مِنْ قَوْمِهِ عَلَىٰ خَوْفٍ مِنْ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِمْ أَنْ يَفْتِنَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ لَعَالٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"Moses said: \"O my people! If ye do (really) believe in Allah, then in Him put your trust if ye submit (your will to His).\"","commentary":"Addressing the fear and hesitation described in the previous verse, Prophet Moses reminded his people that true belief in Allah requires placing complete trust in Him. He emphasized that trusting in Allah is a natural outcome of surrendering one's will to the Divine. In a situation where they faced a powerful oppressor, Prophet Moses guided them to find strength and reassurance by relying on Allah.","arabic":"وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يَا قَوْمِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ آمَنْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُوا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُسْلِمِينَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"They said: \"In Allah do we put out trust. Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practise oppression;","commentary":"Responding to Prophet Moses' call to trust in Allah, the small group of believers affirmed that they had indeed placed their trust in Allah. They then offered a prayer, asking Allah not to allow them to become a means of temptation or trial for the oppressors. This prayer sought protection, fearing that if they were overcome or suffered greatly, the oppressors might feel validated in their disbelief and actions, leading them further astray.","arabic":"فَقَالُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"\"And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject (Thee).\"","commentary":"Continuing their supplication from the previous verse, the believers specifically asked Allah, through His mercy, to save and deliver them from those who rejected faith. This prayer is a direct appeal for divine intervention and protection from the hostile environment created by Pharaoh and his people, demonstrating their reliance on Allah for rescue.","arabic":"وَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: \"Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe!\"","commentary":"Following the prayers of the believers for protection and deliverance, Allah revealed to Prophet Moses and his brother, Prophet Aaron, a divine instruction. They were told to designate specific homes for the Children of Israel in Egypt and to transform these homes into places of regular prayer and worship. This command served to spiritually mobilize and organize the community of believers, creating their own space for devotion and strengthening their connection with Allah while living under oppression. It also implies preparing them for a future event and promises good news for those who hold onto their faith.","arabic":"وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَأَخِيهِ أَنْ تَبَوَّآ لِقَوْمِكُمَا بِمِصْرَ بُيُوتًا وَاجْعَلُوا بُيُوتَكُمْ قِبْلَةً وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"Moses prayed: \"Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of the present, and so, Our Lord, they mislead (men) from Thy Path. Deface, our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty.\"","commentary":"At this point in the narrative, possibly having seen the persistent rejection and the harmful influence of Pharaoh and his leaders' wealth and power on others, Prophet Moses turned to Allah in prayer against them. He acknowledged that Allah had given them worldly splendor and riches, which they used to divert people from Allah's path. Prophet Moses then prayed for their wealth to be diminished or rendered useless and for their hearts to become hardened, reaching a point where they would not believe until they faced a severe punishment. This prayer reflects a moment of despair regarding their potential for repentance and a request for divine justice.","arabic":"وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ آتَيْتَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَأَهُ زِينَةً وَأَمْوَالًا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا رَبَّنَا لِيُضِلُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِكَ ۖ رَبَّنَا اطْمِسْ عَلَىٰ أَمْوَالِهِمْ وَاشْدُدْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَلَا يُؤْمِنُوا حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا الْعَذَابَ الْأَلِيمَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"Allah said: \"Accepted is your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)! So stand ye straight, and follow not the path of those who know not.\"","commentary":"In response to the prayer of Prophet Moses (and Prophet Aaron, as they worked together), Allah declared that their supplication was accepted. This signifies that the divine decree regarding Pharaoh and his people had been set in motion. Along with this acceptance, Allah instructed both prophets to remain steadfast on the right path, upholding their faith and mission. They were warned not to follow the ways of those who lacked knowledge – those who are misguided, uncertain, or act ignorantly towards divine truth – thus reinforcing the importance of firm faith and clear direction. This verse marks a turning point, indicating that the time for confronting Pharaoh through signs and warnings was concluding, and the stage was set for the consequences of his disbelief.","arabic":"قَالَ قَدْ أُجِيبَتْ دَعْوَتُكُمَا فَاسْتَقِيمَا وَلَا تَتَّبِعَانِّ سَبِيلَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when overwhelmed with the flood, he said: \"I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit (to Allah in Islam).\"","commentary":"Following the acceptance of Prophet Moses' prayer and the instruction for steadfastness, this verse describes the climactic event. Allah enabled the Children of Israel to cross the sea safely. Pharaoh and his army, driven by arrogance and hostility, pursued them. However, as they were engulfed by the water, Pharaoh, facing imminent destruction, declared his belief in the God of the Children of Israel and his submission to Allah. This declaration came at the point of death when no other option remained. The verse starkly contrasts the safety of the believers with the fate of the tyrannical pursuers, illustrating the outcome of trusting in Allah versus rejecting His truth. (Note: The consequence and acceptance of this last-minute belief are addressed in verses immediately following this one, outside the current range).","arabic":"وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ الْبَحْرَ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ وَجُنُودُهُ بَغْيًا وَعَدْوًا ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَدْرَكَهُ الْغَرَقُ قَالَ آمَنْتُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا الَّذِي آمَنَتْ بِهِ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَنَا مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"(It was said to him): \"Ah now!- But a little while before, wast thou in rebellion!- and thou didst mischief (and violence)!","commentary":"This verse captures the moment when the Pharaoh, drowning in the sea, suddenly declares his belief in Allah, the God of the Children of Israel. The response comes, essentially asking, \"Only now do you believe?\" It highlights that just moments before, the Pharaoh was defiant and had spread corruption and oppression in the land. His sudden declaration of faith comes only at the point of facing certain destruction, when there is no longer any choice. This connects to the previous verse (90) which described the Children of Israel crossing the sea and the Pharaoh pursuing them with aggression, leading to his drowning.","arabic":"آلْآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنْتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"\"This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!\"","commentary":"Continuing the address to the drowning Pharaoh, this verse explains that Allah will preserve his body so it can serve as a lesson for future generations. It is a powerful sign demonstrating the fate of those who defy Allah and oppress others. However, the verse concludes with a note of sadness or warning, observing that despite clear signs like this, many people remain heedless and do not reflect on their significance. This connects to the previous verse (91) by showing the final consequence of the Pharaoh's rebellion and how his end is made a clear sign.","arabic":"فَالْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ آيَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنَ النَّاسِ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا لَغَافِلُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best: it was after knowledge had been granted to them, that they fell into schisms. Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them, on the Day of Judgment.","commentary":"Following the account of the Pharaoh's destruction and the Children of Israel's salvation (verses 90-92), this verse shifts to describe the subsequent history of the Children of Israel. It mentions that Allah granted them a secure and blessed land to dwell in, providing them with good provisions. However, it notes that after they were given knowledge and divine guidance, they unfortunately began to disagree and split into factions. The verse concludes by stating that Allah will be the ultimate judge of their differences on the Day of Judgment. This shows that even after being saved and blessed, communities can falter, highlighting the ongoing human responsibility to adhere to truth and unity.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ بَوَّأْنَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِنَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ فَمَا اخْتَلَفُوا حَتَّىٰ جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"If thou wert in doubt as to what We have revealed unto thee, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee: the Truth hath indeed come to thee from thy Lord: so be in no wise of those in doubt.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus and addresses Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) directly. It offers a powerful reassurance: if he were ever in doubt about the revelations given to him – including the accounts of past prophets and nations mentioned earlier – he could consult the people who received scriptures before him, implying their knowledge would confirm the truth of the Qur'an. The verse emphasizes that the truth has undeniably come from Allah. While the Prophet himself had no doubt, this serves as a strong affirmation of the divine origin of the message and also provides a principle for believers to seek knowledge from reliable sources. It connects to the previous verses by implicitly confirming that the stories shared about past peoples are consistent with earlier divine messages.","arabic":"فَإِنْ كُنْتَ فِي شَكٍّ مِمَّا أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ فَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ ۚ لَقَدْ جَاءَكَ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"Nor be of those who reject the signs of Allah, or thou shalt be of those who perish.","commentary":"Building on the affirmation in the previous verse (94) that the revelation is the truth from Allah, this verse warns against denying Allah's signs or revelations. It states that those who do so risk becoming among those who are lost or perish. This serves as a strong admonishment against rejecting the clear evidence presented in the divine message and throughout the universe. It reinforces the importance of accepting the truth that has been revealed.","arabic":"وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"Those against whom the word of thy Lord hath been verified would not believe-","commentary":"This verse explains why some people, despite receiving clear signs, will not believe. It speaks of those against whom Allah's \"word\" or decree has been \"verified\" or confirmed. This refers to people whose persistent denial and rejection of truth have led them to a point where, according to Allah's established laws regarding human free will and its consequences, they will not accept faith. This sets the stage for the next verse (97) which further elaborates on their situation.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Even if every Sign was brought unto them,- until they see (for themselves) the penalty grievous.","commentary":"This verse continues the point made in the previous one (96), emphasizing the stubbornness of those against whom Allah's word has been verified. It states that even if they were shown every possible sign, they still would not believe. Their hearts and minds have become unreceptive due to their persistent rejection, and the only thing that will make them acknowledge the truth is witnessing the severe punishment they are destined for. This reinforces the idea that willful denial has profound consequences.","arabic":"وَلَوْ جَاءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ آيَةٍ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا الْعَذَابَ الْأَلِيمَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Why was there not a single township (among those We warned), which believed,- so its faith should have profited it,- except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present, and permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the typical fate of defiant communities mentioned earlier with a unique exception: the people of Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him). It observes that none of the warned communities believed *as a whole* in time to avert punishment and benefit from their faith in this life, except for Jonah's people. When they finally believed, just as the punishment was imminent, Allah mercifully lifted the impending humiliating penalty from them in this world and allowed them to continue living for a time. This highlights the possibility of repentance and acceptance of faith, even at a late stage, as a means of seeking Allah's mercy, though the typical consequence of delay is destruction.","arabic":"فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّا آمَنُوا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الْخِزْيِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"99","text":"If it had been thy Lord's will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe!","commentary":"This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and by extension, all believers, regarding the nature of faith and human will. It states that if it had been Allah's absolute will to force belief, He could have made everyone on Earth believe. But He did not. The verse then poses a rhetorical question: \"Will you then compel mankind, against their will, to believe?\" This emphasizes that belief is meant to be a matter of free choice and conviction, not compulsion. It connects to the previous verses by explaining that while some communities faced punishment due to their *choice* to disbelieve, belief itself cannot be forced upon people, as it goes against Allah's design for human responsibility.","arabic":"وَلَوْ شَاءَ رَبُّكَ لَآمَنَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا ۚ أَفَأَنْتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّىٰ يَكُونُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"No soul can believe, except by the will of Allah, and He will place doubt (or obscurity) on those who will not understand.","commentary":"This verse further clarifies the balance between Allah's will and human choice in the matter of belief. It states that no soul can believe except by Allah's permission or will. This doesn't mean Allah prevents sincere seekers from believing; rather, it signifies that belief is ultimately a gift and depends on aligning one's will with the path that leads to faith, which is by Allah's design and guidance. The verse then adds that Allah places \"doubt\" or \"obscurity\" on those who refuse to use their intellect and faculties to understand the signs and message. This is a consequence of their own choice to turn away from seeking truth, leading their hearts and minds to become unreceptive. This reinforces the theme of responsibility and the consequences of choosing disbelief discussed in previous verses (96-97).","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَجْعَلُ الرِّجْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"Say: \"O ye men! If ye are in doubt as to my religion, (behold!) I worship not what ye worship, other than Allah! But I worship Allah - Who will take your souls (at death): I am commanded to be (in the ranks) of the Believers,","commentary":"This verse begins with a declaration addressed to all people. It acknowledges that some may be uncertain about the Prophet Muhammad's message and faith. He is instructed to state clearly that he does not worship the same things that others might worship alongside or instead of Allah. He affirms that his worship is directed solely to Allah, the one who has ultimate power over life and death, who determines when each soul will pass away. He states that he is acting purely on the command given to him by Allah, placing himself firmly among those who believe in Allah's oneness and sovereignty. This verse sets the stage for the final instructions and declarations in this part of the Qur'an.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِنْ دِينِي فَلَا أَعْبُدُ الَّذِينَ تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنْ أَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ الَّذِي يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ ۖ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"105","text":"\"And further (thus): 'set thy face towards religion with true piety, and never in any wise be of the Unbelievers;","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's declaration of faith, this verse directly instructs the Prophet (and through him, all believers) to turn sincerely and fully towards the true faith. It emphasizes devotion and righteousness in following the path guided by Allah. The verse explicitly warns against being among those who do not accept the truth about Allah's oneness and guidance. This serves as a clear directive to maintain purity of faith and practice, reinforcing the commitment mentioned in Verse 104.","arabic":"وَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"106","text":"\"'Nor call on any, other than Allah;- Such will neither profit thee nor hurt thee: if thou dost, behold! thou shalt certainly be of those who do wrong.'\"","commentary":"Following the instruction to be solely devoted to Allah (Verse 105), this verse provides a crucial consequence of not doing so. It forbids calling upon or seeking help from anything or anyone other than Allah. The reason given is that such beings or objects have no real power to benefit or harm anyone. Seeking help from them instead of Allah is described as a form of wrongdoing, indicating that it is an action that goes against the fundamental truth and justice established by Allah. This prohibition strengthens the call for exclusive worship of Allah.","arabic":"وَلَا تَدْعُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ ۖ فَإِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"107","text":"If Allah do touch thee with hurt, there is none can remove it but He: if He do design some benefit for thee, there is none can keep back His favour: He causeth it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleaseth. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the message of Verse 106 by explaining why only Allah should be called upon. It highlights Allah's absolute control over all things. It states that if Allah wills for someone to experience hardship, no one else can remove it. Similarly, if Allah wills good or favour for someone, no one can prevent it from reaching them. Allah is the ultimate source of all outcomes, directing His favour to whomever He wills among His servants. The verse concludes by reminding us of Allah's attributes: He is the Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful, indicating His willingness to forgive those who turn to Him and show mercy to His creation. This underscores His unique power and compassion, further solidifying the reasons for worshipping Him alone.","arabic":"وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ وَإِنْ يُرِدْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَلَا رَادَّ لِفَضْلِهِ ۚ يُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Say: \"O ye men! Now Truth hath reached you from your Lord! those who receive guidance, do so for the good of their own souls; those who stray, do so to their own loss: and I am not (set) over you to arrange your affairs.\"","commentary":"After presenting the core message of worshipping Allah alone and acknowledging His absolute power, this verse acts as a final declaration. It proclaims to all humanity that the undeniable truth has come to them from their Lord, Allah. It then clarifies the principle of individual accountability: whoever chooses to follow the guidance does so for their own benefit and spiritual well-being, while whoever chooses to go astray does so at their own peril and loss. The Prophet is instructed to make it clear that his role is simply to deliver the message; he is not appointed to force people to believe or to control their lives. Each person is responsible for their own choices before Allah. This verse emphasizes free will and accountability.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا ۖ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Follow thou the inspiration sent unto thee, and be patient and constant, till Allah do decide: for He is the best to decide.","commentary":"This concluding verse addresses the Prophet directly, providing guidance for his path forward. It instructs him to continue following the divine revelations sent to him and to remain patient and steadfast in the face of challenges or opposition. This perseverance is required until Allah makes His ultimate judgment concerning the matter between the Prophet and those who reject the truth. The verse ends by affirming that Allah is the best and most just judge. This serves as a final note of reliance on Allah's wisdom and decree, bringing the sūrah to a close with a call for commitment and patience until the divine outcome unfolds.","arabic":"وَاتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَاصْبِرْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَاكِمِينَ"}];
