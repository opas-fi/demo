    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"(It teacheth) that ye should worship none but Allah. (Say): \"Verily I am (sent) unto you from Him to warn and to bring glad tidings:","commentary":"This verse begins with the Arabic letters Alif, Lam, Ra. These are among the mysterious letters that appear at the start of some chapters of the Qur'an. They are seen as a challenge, indicating that while this Book is composed of the same letters humans use, no one can produce anything similar to it. The verse then describes the Qur'an as a Book whose verses are perfected in their structure and meaning, and distinctly spelled out. It emphasizes that this Book comes from Allah, the One who is Wise and All-aware, highlighting that its perfection and clarity are a result of His wisdom and comprehensive knowledge. This establishes the divine origin and inherent truth of the message that follows.","arabic":"أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّنِي لَكُمْ مِنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ"},{"verse":"2","text":"\"(And to preach thus), 'Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good (and true), for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if ye turn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day:","commentary":"Following the declaration of the Qur'an's divine origin and perfect nature, this verse states its primary message: that humanity should worship and submit to none but Allah alone. The verse then shifts to the role of the Messenger, emphasizing that he is sent from Allah with a clear purpose: to warn people of the consequences of disobedience and to bring glad tidings to those who believe and follow His guidance. This connects directly to the preceding verse by presenting the core teaching delivered through the Book originating from Allah.","arabic":"وَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ ۖ وَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ"},{"verse":"3","text":"'To Allah is your return, and He hath power over all things.'\"","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the message of warning and glad tidings. It calls on people to seek Allah's forgiveness for their wrongdoings and to turn to Him in sincere repentance, which means refraining from sins and actively striving to do what is right according to Allah's commands. For those who do so, there is the promise of a good and blessed life in this world until the appointed time of death, as well as abundant reward for their good deeds. This \"goodly enjoyment\" can encompass spiritual contentment and reassurance, as well as material well-being, depending on the individual and community. Conversely, the verse issues a stern warning: if people turn away from this path, they will face the penalty of a \"great day,\" referring to the severe consequences awaiting disbelievers in the hereafter. This verse offers a clear choice and outlines the outcomes of following or rejecting the divine call.","arabic":"إِلَى اللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"4","text":"Behold! they fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Ah even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knoweth what they conceal, and what they reveal: for He knoweth well the (inmost secrets) of the hearts.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the warning about the \"great day\" mentioned in the previous verse. It states that ultimately, everyone will return to Allah. This return signifies accountability for one's actions in this life and the commencement of judgment. The verse concludes by emphasizing Allah's absolute power over all things. This serves as a reminder that resurrection and judgment are entirely within His capability, removing any doubt about the inevitability of the return and the consequences that follow. It links back to the earlier verses by underlining the authority of the One who sent the Book and the Messenger.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُوا مِنْهُ ۚ أَلَا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ"},{"verse":"5","text":"There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah: He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record.","commentary":"This verse describes the attitude of some who received the message. It portrays their futile attempt to hide from Allah, even folding up their hearts (meaning trying to conceal their inner feelings and beliefs) or covering themselves with garments. The verse highlights the absurdity of such actions by stating that Allah knows everything they hide and everything they reveal, even in their most private moments, emphasizing that He has full knowledge of the deepest secrets within their hearts. This connects to the previous verse's assertion of Allah's power and knowledge, illustrating that no human attempt at concealment can escape His awareness.","arabic":"وَمَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"6","text":"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if thou wert to say to them, \"Ye shall indeed be raised up after death\", the Unbelievers would be sure to say, \"This is nothing but obvious sorcery!\"","commentary":"Expanding on the theme of Allah's comprehensive knowledge and power, this verse states that every living creature on Earth receives its sustenance from Allah. It affirms His knowledge extends to the exact location where each creature permanently dwells and where it temporarily rests. This emphasizes Allah's role as the Sustainer of all life and His intimate knowledge of every single creature's existence. The verse concludes by stating that all this information is recorded in a clear Book, further underscoring the completeness and precision of Allah's knowledge and planning for the universe and its inhabitants. This serves as another piece of evidence for Allah's absolute authority and capability, reinforcing the message of the earlier verses.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۗ وَلَئِنْ قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَبْعُوثُونَ مِنْ بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"7","text":"If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, \"What keeps it back?\" Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!","commentary":"This verse provides further insight into Allah's creative power and purpose. It states that He created the heavens and the earth in six \"days\" (referring to distinct periods of time, the nature of which is fully known to Allah). It also mentions that His Throne was over the waters before or during this creation process, a detail whose full meaning is known only to Allah. The verse explains the purpose behind this grand creation: to test humanity, to see who among them performs the best actions. This highlights the importance of human conduct as the focus of this life's existence. The verse then notes the reaction of those who disbelieve when told they will be resurrected after death; they dismiss the idea outright, calling it mere \"sorcery,\" demonstrating their inability to grasp the scope of Allah's power and the purpose of creation, which connects back to the themes of accountability and the hereafter in earlier verses.","arabic":"وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ مَعْدُودَةٍ لَيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"8","text":"If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and (falls into) blasphemy.","commentary":"Following the mention of the disbelievers' denial of resurrection, this verse addresses their attitude towards delayed punishment. It points out their impatience and questioning as to why punishment, if real, isn't immediate. The verse then warns that when the appointed time for the penalty arrives, nothing will be able to avert it. They will be completely overwhelmed by the very consequences they doubted and mocked. This underscores Allah's wisdom in delaying punishment (perhaps allowing time for reflection or for others to benefit) but also the certainty and inescapability of His judgment when it comes, tying into the warning of the \"great day\" mentioned earlier.","arabic":"وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا الْإِنْسَانَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَاهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُ لَيَئُوسٌ كَفُورٌ"},{"verse":"9","text":"But if We give him a taste of (Our) favours after adversity hath touched him, he is sure to say, \"All evil has departed from me:\" Behold! he falls into exultation and pride.","commentary":"This verse begins a brief exploration of human psychology, particularly highlighting a common human tendency when disconnected from faith in Allah. It describes how, if Allah grants a person comfort or favor, and then that is taken away, they can easily fall into deep despair and become ungrateful or question divine justice. This illustrates human fragility and short-sightedness when solely focused on worldly circumstances, contrasting with the steadfastness expected from a believer discussed in later verses. It shows one side of the human reaction to changing fortunes.","arabic":"وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَاهُ نَعْمَاءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّاءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ السَّيِّئَاتُ عَنِّي ۚ إِنَّهُ لَفَرِحٌ فَخُورٌ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness (of sins) and a great reward.","commentary":"Continuing the observation on human nature, this verse presents the opposite scenario to the previous one. If, after experiencing hardship, a person is granted favors and ease by Allah, they tend to become overly joyous, feeling that all difficulties are permanently gone, and may fall into boasting and pride. This shows another aspect of human inconsistency without a strong connection to Allah – reacting with extremes of despair or arrogance depending on circumstances. Both verses 9 and 10 serve to highlight the unstable nature of human attitudes towards life's ups and downs without the grounding of faith and a proper understanding of Allah's plan and purpose.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ مَغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"11","text":"Perchance thou mayest (feel the inclination) to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, \"Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?\" But thou art there only to warn! It is Allah that arrangeth all affairs!","commentary":"Following a description of how people can be inconsistent in their reactions to ease and hardship (mentioned in previous verses), this verse highlights the exception: those who are patient and steadfast, maintaining righteous conduct in all circumstances. It explains that unlike those who despair in difficulty or boast in prosperity, these patient individuals will receive forgiveness for their shortcomings and be granted a great reward from Allah. Their consistent belief and good deeds set them apart.","arabic":"فَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكٌ بَعْضَ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَضَائِقٌ بِهِ صَدْرُكَ أَنْ يَقُولُوا لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ جَاءَ مَعَهُ مَلَكٌ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ نَذِيرٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Or they may say, \"He forged it,\" Say, \"Bring ye then ten suras forged, like unto it, and call (to your aid) whomsoever ye can, other than Allah!- If ye speak the truth!","commentary":"This verse addresses Prophet Muhammad directly, acknowledging the difficulty he faced when people rejected his message and demanded material signs, such as treasures being sent down or an angel appearing with him. It suggests that facing such obstinacy might feel burdensome. However, the verse reminds the Prophet, and by extension, believers, that his role is primarily to warn people about the truth and its consequences. It emphasizes that Allah is in control of all matters, and the Prophet's duty is to convey the message, not to produce signs according to people's demands. This reassures the Prophet and highlights the nature of his mission.","arabic":"أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۖ قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُوا مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"\"If then they (your false gods) answer not your (call), know ye that this revelation is sent down (replete) with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but He! will ye even then submit (to Islam)?\"","commentary":"After the previous verse highlighted the unreasonable demands of disbelievers for signs, this verse directly confronts their claim that the Qur'an was invented by Prophet Muhammad. Allah challenges them to produce ten chapters (surahs) like those in the Qur'an, inviting them to seek help from anyone they wish, other than Allah. This challenge is a demonstration of the unique and divine nature of the Qur'an; its eloquence, wisdom, and content are presented as beyond human capability to imitate, thereby proving its source is Allah. It connects to the ongoing theme of proving the truthfulness of the message.","arabic":"فَإِلَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَكُمْ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أُنْزِلَ بِعِلْمِ اللَّهِ وَأَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter,- to them we shall pay (the price of) their deeds therein,- without diminution.","commentary":"This verse continues the challenge from the previous one. It states that if those they call upon for help (besides Allah) cannot assist them in meeting the challenge of producing chapters like the Qur'an, then it should become clear to them that the Qur'an was sent down with Allah's unique knowledge. This inability to imitate the Qur'an serves as proof that only Allah possesses the knowledge and power to reveal such a book, thus establishing that there is no deity worthy of worship other than Him. The verse concludes by asking if, even after this clear evidence, they will accept the truth and submit to Allah's will (which is the meaning of \"submit to Islam\"). It underscores the logical conclusion derived from their failure to meet the challenge.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا نُوَفِّ إِلَيْهِمْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فِيهَا وَهُمْ فِيهَا لَا يُبْخَسُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect and the deeds that they do!","commentary":"Transitioning from the challenge and the call to believe in Allah, this verse describes the focus and outcome for a specific group of people: those whose main desire and effort are directed solely towards the pleasures and achievements of this worldly life. It explains that Allah will fully reward them for their deeds and efforts *in this life*, granting them the results they sought without any decrease. This highlights Allah's justice, showing that He provides for everyone according to their aims and efforts, but also sets the stage for the next verse which contrasts this with their outcome in the Hereafter.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا النَّارُ ۖ وَحَبِطَ مَا صَنَعُوا فِيهَا وَبَاطِلٌ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!","commentary":"This verse continues from the previous one, describing the ultimate fate of those who focused only on worldly life (mentioned in Verse 15). It clarifies that because they did not direct their efforts towards earning Allah's pleasure or preparing for the life to come, their reward is limited to this world. In the Hereafter, their destiny is the Fire. Furthermore, all the plans they made and actions they performed in this world, although they yielded results here, will be considered fruitless and valueless in the Hereafter from a spiritual perspective, as they were not done for Allah.","arabic":"أَفَمَنْ كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِنْهُ وَمِنْ قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ ۚ فَلَا تَكُ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِنْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Who doth more wrong than those who invent a lie against Allah? They will be turned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong!-","commentary":"This verse contrasts the situation of those who reject the truth (like those described in the previous verses) with those who have a \"clear evidence\" from their Lord. This clear evidence refers to the message brought by Prophet Muhammad, which is supported by a \"witness\" from Allah Himself – the Qur'an – and was preceded and testified to by earlier divine books like the Book of Moses (the Torah), which was a guide and mercy for its people. Those who truly believe in this message will find guidance. In contrast, the verse states that those who reject the truth, from any group or background, are destined for the Fire. The verse then reassures the Prophet and believers that this message is undeniably the truth from Allah, even if many people choose not to believe, connecting back to the challenges and rejections mentioned earlier.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ الْأَشْهَادُ هَٰؤُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۚ أَلَا لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"\"Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter!\"","commentary":"Following the contrast between believers and rejecters, this verse highlights the extreme wrongdoing of those who invent lies against Allah. This includes claims like associating partners with Him, denying His messengers, or fabricating falsehoods about His attributes or commands. It then depicts a scene from the Day of Judgment where these liars will be brought before Allah, and witnesses (perhaps angels, prophets, or other people) will expose them, pointing them out as those who lied against their Lord. It concludes with a declaration that Allah's curse is upon such wrongdoers, emphasizing the severity of their actions and their ultimate disgrace. This serves as a stern warning to those who fabricate lies about Allah.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَهُمْ بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"They will in no wise frustrate (His design) on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power to hear, and they did not see!","commentary":"This verse provides further description of the \"wrongdoers\" mentioned in the preceding verse. It identifies them as those who actively try to prevent others from following the straight path established by Allah and who seek to introduce distortions or corruption into this path. Their actions are linked directly to their denial of the Hereafter (the life to come). This shows that their rejection of accountability in the next life motivates them to mislead themselves and others in this life, reinforcing the consequences of disbelief discussed earlier.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُوا مُعْجِزِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۘ يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ ۚ مَا كَانُوا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ السَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُوا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the (fancies) they invented have left them in the lurch!","commentary":"Concluding the description of the wrongdoers from the previous verses, this verse states their utter helplessness against Allah's power. It emphasizes that they cannot escape or frustrate Allah's plan or punishment on Earth, nor can they find any protectors or allies besides Allah to save them. Their punishment in the Hereafter is mentioned to be doubled, perhaps for their own wrongdoing and for misleading others. The verse ends with a metaphorical statement that they were effectively deaf and blind to the truth – they had the physical senses but did not use them to understand or accept the divine message. This highlights their spiritual deficiency caused by their denial and wrongdoing.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter!","commentary":"This verse follows the description of those who reject Allah's message and invent lies against Him. It explains the ultimate consequence for such people: they have \"lost their own souls.\" This is presented as the most profound loss possible, greater than any worldly gain, because they have wasted their potential and failed to recognize the true dignity that comes from submitting only to Allah. Their denial of the Hereafter and their lies against Allah lead to this state. The verse also says that the false gods or ideas they invented or relied upon will abandon them when they need them most, providing no support or benefit. This highlights the futility of relying on anything other than Allah.","arabic":"لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ هُمُ الْأَخْسَرُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord,- They will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein for aye!","commentary":"Building on the previous verse which spoke of losing one's soul in this life and their inventions failing them, this verse emphasizes their fate in the Hereafter. It declares that those who deny the truth and invent lies against Allah will be the \"greatest losers\" in the life to come. This reinforces the idea that losing one's soul and future in the Hereafter is the ultimate failure, contrasting sharply with the fate of believers described next.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَأَخْبَتُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"These two kinds (of men) may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will ye not then take heed?","commentary":"In stark contrast to those described as losers in the previous verses, this verse speaks about the believers. It says that those who \"believe and do righteous deeds\" and who \"humble themselves before their Lord\" will have a completely different outcome. The phrase \"humble themselves\" carries a deep meaning of submission, trust, and finding peace and security in their connection with Allah. These individuals, unlike the deniers, are promised \"gardens\" (Paradise), where they will live permanently. This verse offers hope and describes the reward for faith and good conduct, setting up a final comparison in the next verse.","arabic":"مَثَلُ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ كَالْأَعْمَىٰ وَالْأَصَمِّ وَالْبَصِيرِ وَالسَّمِيعِ ۚ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"We sent Noah to his people (with a mission): \"I have come to you with a Clear Warning:","commentary":"This verse provides a powerful analogy to summarize the difference between the two groups just described: the deniers who are losers and the believers who are promised Paradise. It compares them to someone who is \"blind and deaf\" versus someone who \"can see and hear well.\" Being \"blind and deaf\" in this context means failing to use one's intellect and faculties to perceive the truth and contemplate reality. The one who \"sees and hears well\" is guided by their understanding and senses. The verse then poses a rhetorical question, \"Are they equal when compared? Will you not then take heed?\", encouraging reflection on this fundamental difference and urging the listener to consider the implications of their choices. This verse serves as a concluding thought on the contrast between the two paths.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ إِنِّي لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"25","text":"\"That ye serve none but Allah: Verily I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day.\"","commentary":"This verse tells us that Allah sent Prophet Noah to his people with a clear message. The message begins with a \"Clear Warning,\" which means a straightforward and unmistakable notification about something important that needs attention. This sets the stage for what Prophet Noah was sent to communicate to his community.","arabic":"أَنْ لَا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ"},{"verse":"26","text":"But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: \"We see (in) thee nothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us, in judgment immature: Nor do we see in you (all) any merit above us: in fact we think ye are liars!\"","commentary":"Following the warning in the previous verse, Prophet Noah clarifies the core message he brought: worship and serve only Allah. This is the central principle of the message. He explains *why* he is giving this warning and message – because he genuinely fears that his people will face severe suffering on a terrible day if they reject this truth. This highlights that the warning is out of concern and leads directly to the purpose of worshipping only Allah.","arabic":"فَقَالَ الْمَلَأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ مَا نَرَاكَ إِلَّا بَشَرًا مِثْلَنَا وَمَا نَرَاكَ اتَّبَعَكَ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَرَاذِلُنَا بَادِيَ الرَّأْيِ وَمَا نَرَىٰ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ فَضْلٍ بَلْ نَظُنُّكُمْ كَاذِبِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"He said: \"O my people! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it?","commentary":"This verse presents the reaction of the leading figures among Prophet Noah's people who did not believe. They raise several objections. Firstly, they dismiss Prophet Noah because he is a human being just like them, implying they expected a messenger to be different. Secondly, they look down on the people who *did* follow him, describing them as being of low social standing and lacking maturity or understanding. This shows their judgment was based on worldly status rather than spiritual worth. Thirdly, they arrogantly claimed they saw no superiority in Prophet Noah or his followers. Finally, they flatly accused Prophet Noah and his followers of being liars. This verse shows the pride and worldly focus of the disbelieving leaders.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّي وَآتَانِي رَحْمَةً مِنْ عِنْدِهِ فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا وَأَنْتُمْ لَهَا كَارِهُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"\"And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but Allah: But I will not drive away (in contempt) those who believe: for verily they are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones!","commentary":"Prophet Noah responds to their objections with kindness and reason. He addresses them as \"O my people,\" showing his continued concern. He asks them to consider the possibility that he has a clear sign and has been shown great mercy from Allah, even if they cannot perceive it due to their own perspectives. He gently points out that these matters (like recognizing a clear sign or mercy from Allah) are not based on outward appearances or social status. He also clarifies that faith is a matter of inner conviction, and he cannot force them to believe if they are resistant, emphasizing that compulsion is not the way of accepting the truth. This verse connects back to their dismissal of him as \"just a man\" by highlighting the spiritual connection and mercy he received from Allah.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مَالًا ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَا أَنَا بِطَارِدِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۚ إِنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو رَبِّهِمْ وَلَٰكِنِّي أَرَاكُمْ قَوْمًا تَجْهَلُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"\"And O my people! who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will ye not then take heed?","commentary":"Prophet Noah continues his response, addressing their contempt for his followers. He tells them he is not seeking any personal gain or wealth from them for delivering the message, as his true reward is only from Allah. This demonstrates his sincerity and lack of worldly ambition. He firmly states that he will not reject or drive away the believers, even though they are looked down upon by the chiefs. He explains this is because these believers are destined to return to Allah, who knows their true worth. He contrasts this with the chiefs, whom he perceives as lacking true understanding or awareness of the values that matter to Allah, highlighting that their judgment based on wealth and status is misguided. This directly counters their accusation that his followers were \"the meanest among us.\"","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ مَنْ يَنْصُرُنِي مِنَ اللَّهِ إِنْ طَرَدْتُهُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"\"I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them (all) that is good: Allah knoweth best what is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer.\"","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, Prophet Noah further explains why he cannot drive away the believers. He poses a rhetorical question: if he were to unjustly dismiss those who believe in Allah and are close to Him, who could protect him from Allah's judgment? This emphasizes that his ultimate accountability is to Allah, not to the chiefs or their worldly standards. He urges them to think carefully about this reality and the potential consequences of their demands, connecting their lack of understanding (mentioned in verse 29) to their failure to reflect on their relationship with Allah.","arabic":"وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ وَلَا أَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ تَزْدَرِي أَعْيُنُكُمْ لَنْ يُؤْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ خَيْرًا ۖ اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ ۖ إِنِّي إِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"They said: \"O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and (much) hast thou prolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with, if thou speakest the truth!?\"","commentary":"Prophet Noah continues to clarify his position and role, directly addressing potential misconceptions and the chiefs' arrogant assumptions. He states he does not claim to possess Allah's treasures or have knowledge of the unseen, nor does he claim to be an angel (perhaps countering an expectation or a potential misrepresentation of messengers). He further challenges their contempt for the poor believers by saying he doesn't claim that Allah will not grant them goodness; Allah knows best the true state of their hearts, which is what truly matters to Allah. He concludes by stating that making such false claims or looking down on those Allah values would make him a wrongdoer, untrue to the message and unjust in Allah's sight. This reinforces the idea that true worth is determined by Allah, not by human social hierarchies.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا نُوحُ قَدْ جَادَلْتَنَا فَأَكْثَرْتَ جِدَالَنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَا إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"He said: \"Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye will not be able to frustrate it!","commentary":"After Prophet Noah's lengthy and earnest explanation, the disbelieving chiefs reach a point of stubborn refusal. They dismiss his reasoned arguments as mere prolonged debate. Unable to counter his logic or accept the truth, they resort to a challenge. They demand that Prophet Noah immediately bring upon them the punishment he warned them about, effectively daring him to prove his truthfulness through divine retribution. This shows their frustration and their reliance on defiance rather than engaging with the message.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ اللَّهُ إِنْ شَاءَ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"\"Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you (good) counsel, if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray: He is your Lord! and to Him will ye return!\"","commentary":"In response to their defiant challenge, Prophet Noah reminds them that bringing about punishment is not within his power but is solely up to Allah. He clarifies that if Allah wills for the punishment to come, it will happen, and nothing they do can prevent or escape it. This highlights Allah's absolute power and sovereignty, contrasting it with their arrogance and limited understanding. His reply is firm but maintains the tone of a messenger conveying Allah's decree, shifting the focus back to Allah's will and authority. This directly addresses their challenge from the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَا يَنْفَعُكُمْ نُصْحِي إِنْ أَرَدْتُ أَنْ أَنْصَحَ لَكُمْ إِنْ كَانَ اللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُغْوِيَكُمْ ۚ هُوَ رَبُّكُمْ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"Or do they say, \"He has forged it\"? Say: \"If I had forged it, on me were my sin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty!","commentary":"Prophet Noah concludes his response by explaining the grim reality of their situation. He expresses his sincere desire to guide them, but states that his counsel will be of no benefit if, because of their persistent rejection and actions, Allah's will is that they remain misguided. This implies that their rejection has consequences according to Allah's divine order. He reminds them that Allah is their Lord and that ultimately, they will all return to Him for judgment. This serves as a final warning and a reminder of the ultimate accountability, connecting their present choices to their future destiny with Allah.","arabic":"أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۖ قُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَعَلَيَّ إِجْرَامِي وَأَنَا بَرِيءٌ مِمَّا تُجْرِمُونَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"It was revealed to Noah: \"None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds.","commentary":"This verse addresses a claim made by people during the time the Qur'an was being revealed, similar to accusations faced by earlier prophets like Prophet Noah. Some people claimed that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had invented this divine message himself. Allah instructs the Prophet to tell them: \"If I have made up this message, then the responsibility for that wrong action is entirely mine. But know that I am completely innocent of the wrongs *you* are committing,\" referring to their rejection of the truth and other misdeeds. This highlights that fabricating a divine message is a grave offense, and the Prophet disavows any such act, while also pointing out their own accountability for their disbelief and opposition.","arabic":"وَأُوحِيَ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ أَنَّهُ لَنْ يُؤْمِنَ مِنْ قَوْمِكَ إِلَّا مَنْ قَدْ آمَنَ فَلَا تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"\"But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood).\"","commentary":"Continuing the story of Prophet Noah, this verse reveals a turning point. Allah informed Prophet Noah that after a long period of calling his people to believe, no one else among them would accept the message except for those who had already done so. This meant that the time for pleading and arguing with the disbelievers was over. Allah instructed Prophet Noah not to feel distressed anymore about their persistent rejection and wrong actions, because their fate had been decided according to Allah's will based on their own choices.","arabic":"وَاصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا وَلَا تُخَاطِبْنِي فِي الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا ۚ إِنَّهُمْ مُغْرَقُونَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: \"If ye ridicule us now, we (in our turn) can look down on you with ridicule likewise!","commentary":"Following the notification that no more of his people would believe (mentioned in the previous verse), Prophet Noah received a new command from Allah. He was instructed to build a large vessel, an Ark. This construction was to take place under Allah's direct supervision and guidance, emphasizing divine support and instruction for the task. Crucially, Prophet Noah was told not to plead with Allah anymore regarding those who continued in disbelief and wrongdoing, because their punishment was imminent – they were destined to be drowned in a flood. This instruction reinforces the finality of the decision regarding those who had rejected the message.","arabic":"وَيَصْنَعُ الْفُلْكَ وَكُلَّمَا مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ مَلَأٌ مِنْ قَوْمِهِ سَخِرُوا مِنْهُ ۚ قَالَ إِنْ تَسْخَرُوا مِنَّا فَإِنَّا نَسْخَرُ مِنْكُمْ كَمَا تَسْخَرُونَ"},{"verse":"38","text":"\"But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting:\"","commentary":"Acting immediately on Allah's command, Prophet Noah began building the Ark. The narrative describes this scene vividly, as if happening in the present. As the leaders and prominent people among his disbelieving community passed by while he was building, they openly mocked him. They scoffed at a man who had claimed to be a prophet from Allah and now seemed busy building a boat far from any water. Prophet Noah responded to their ridicule with confidence, telling them that if they mocked him now, he and the believers would mock them in return. His response was rooted in the knowledge of what was soon to happen, which they could not foresee.","arabic":"فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَيَحِلُّ عَلَيْهِ عَذَابٌ مُقِيمٌ"},{"verse":"39","text":"At length, behold! there came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: \"Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family - except those against whom the word has already gone forth,- and the Believers.\" but only a few believed with him.","commentary":"Continuing his response to those who mocked him while he built the Ark (as mentioned in the previous verse), Prophet Noah issued a solemn warning. He told them that they would soon discover who would be afflicted with a punishment that would disgrace them and endure for a long time. This statement contrasted their current fleeting mockery with the severe and lasting consequence awaiting them for their disbelief and rejection of Allah's message.","arabic":"حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ التَّنُّورُ قُلْنَا احْمِلْ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلَّا مَنْ سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَوْلُ وَمَنْ آمَنَ ۚ وَمَا آمَنَ مَعَهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ"},{"verse":"40","text":"So he said: \"Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!\"","commentary":"After Prophet Noah completed the Ark and issued his warning, Allah's command for the flood arrived. The earth's springs burst forth, and water gushed out as a sign that the event was beginning. At this critical moment, Allah instructed Prophet Noah to gather creatures by taking a pair, male and female, of every kind into the Ark. He was also to bring his family, with the exception of those among them who were disbelievers and against whom Allah's decree of punishment had already been sealed (referencing back to verse 37). Additionally, all the other believers who were not from his immediate family were to enter the Ark. The verse notes that despite the long period of preaching, only a small number of people had truly believed with Prophet Noah and were saved with him.","arabic":"وَقَالَ ارْكَبُوا فِيهَا بِسْمِ اللَّهِ مَجْرَاهَا وَمُرْسَاهَا ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"41","text":"So the Ark floated with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (from the rest): \"O my son! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!\"","commentary":"With the rising waters and the instructions received, Prophet Noah told the people and creatures boarding the Ark, \"Embark in it.\" He then instructed them to do so by invoking \"the name of Allah.\" This phrase signifies entrusting the entire journey to Allah's care and power, acknowledging that it is by His will alone that the Ark would sail safely and come to rest. He reminded them of Allah's attributes, describing Him as \"Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,\" which offers solace and hope, particularly for the believers facing such a cataclysmic event. This connects to the theme of Allah's mercy being reserved for the believers while the disbelievers face judgment.","arabic":"وَهِيَ تَجْرِي بِهِمْ فِي مَوْجٍ كَالْجِبَالِ وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ ابْنَهُ وَكَانَ فِي مَعْزِلٍ يَا بُنَيَّ ارْكَبْ مَعَنَا وَلَا تَكُنْ مَعَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"42","text":"The son replied: \"I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water.\" Noah said: \"This day nothing can save, from the command of Allah, any but those on whom He hath mercy! \"And the waves came between them, and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood.","commentary":"As the flood intensified and the Ark sailed amidst immense, wave-like mountains (reflecting the terrifying scale of the deluge), a poignant scene unfolds. Prophet Noah saw one of his sons who had chosen not to join the believers in the Ark and had separated himself. Overcome by paternal love and concern, Prophet Noah called out to his son, pleading with him to board the Ark with them and not remain among those who disbelieved in Allah. This shows Prophet Noah's final attempt to save his son, extending the call to faith even at this moment of ultimate judgment.","arabic":"قَالَ سَآوِي إِلَىٰ جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِي مِنَ الْمَاءِ ۚ قَالَ لَا عَاصِمَ الْيَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا مَنْ رَحِمَ ۚ وَحَالَ بَيْنَهُمَا الْمَوْجُ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُغْرَقِينَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"Then the word went forth: \"O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold (thy rain)!\" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: \"Away with those who do wrong!\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Noah's heartfelt plea (from the previous verse), his son arrogantly refused, believing that seeking refuge on a high mountain would protect him from the water. Prophet Noah, understanding the true nature of the event as Allah's judgment, replied that on that day, nothing could offer protection from Allah's command except His mercy, which was extended only to the believers in the Ark. Immediately after this exchange, the powerful waves rose between them, and Prophet Noah's son was consumed by the flood, becoming one of the drowned disbelievers. This starkly illustrates that family ties are overridden by the lack of faith in the face of divine judgment.","arabic":"وَقِيلَ يَا أَرْضُ ابْلَعِي مَاءَكِ وَيَا سَمَاءُ أَقْلِعِي وَغِيضَ الْمَاءُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ وَاسْتَوَتْ عَلَى الْجُودِيِّ ۖ وَقِيلَ بُعْدًا لِلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: \"O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!\"","commentary":"Once Allah's judgment upon the disbelievers was complete, the command was issued to the natural elements involved in the flood. Allah directly addressed the earth, ordering it to absorb its water, and the sky, ordering it to cease its rain. The commentary highlights the powerful imagery of creation obeying Allah's direct command. As a result, the water subsided, bringing the great flood to an end. The Ark came to rest upon Mount Judi. The conclusion of this devastating event is marked by a declaration about those who had committed wrong by rejecting Allah's message: they were removed from existence and memory in this context. This verse signifies the completion of the divine punishment and the establishment of a new beginning for Prophet Noah and the believers.","arabic":"وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ رَبَّهُ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ابْنِي مِنْ أَهْلِي وَإِنَّ وَعْدَكَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنْتَ أَحْكَمُ الْحَاكِمِينَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"He said: \"O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant!\"","commentary":"After the great flood subsided and the ark came to rest, Prophet Noah, seeing that one of his sons was among the drowned, turned to Allah in prayer. He expresses his understanding that this son was part of his family, and that Allah's promise to save his family was true. He also affirms his belief that Allah is the Most Just Judge. This shows Prophet Noah's deep trust in Allah's justice and truthfulness, even as he grappled with the fate of his son. This verse sets up the divine clarification that follows regarding the true nature of relationships in the sight of Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا نُوحُ إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ ۖ إِنَّهُ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَالِحٍ ۖ فَلَا تَسْأَلْنِ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ ۖ إِنِّي أَعِظُكَ أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Noah said: \"O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost!\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Noah's plea, Allah clarifies a fundamental principle. He explains that the son was not truly part of Prophet Noah's family in a way that would grant him salvation, because his actions and beliefs were unrighteous (he did not believe). This teaches us that in the divine perspective, the bond of faith and righteous conduct is paramount, overriding even blood relations when it comes to salvation. Allah then advises Prophet Noah not to ask about matters he does not fully grasp, and warns him against being among those who are unaware of these divine truths. This verse directly follows Prophet Noah's question and provides a crucial lesson about the nature of divine judgment and true belonging.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أَسْأَلَكَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ ۖ وَإِلَّا تَغْفِرْ لِي وَتَرْحَمْنِي أَكُنْ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"The word came: \"O Noah! Come down (from the Ark) with peace from Us, and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples (who will spring) from those with thee: but (there will be other) peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us.\"","commentary":"Upon receiving Allah's clarification, Prophet Noah immediately understands and seeks refuge with Allah from asking about things he doesn't know, showing his humility and complete submission. He recognizes the potential for error in his previous request and prays for Allah's forgiveness and mercy, acknowledging that without divine grace, he would be among those who suffer loss. This verse shows Prophet Noah's deep faith and immediate repentance, reinforcing his status as a righteous servant of Allah, contrasting with the attitude of his disbelieving son.","arabic":"قِيلَ يَا نُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَامٍ مِنَّا وَبَرَكَاتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِمَّنْ مَعَكَ ۚ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"48","text":"Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.","commentary":"With the flood over and the lesson about true family bonds understood, the command is given for Prophet Noah and those with him to disembark from the ark. They are given a greeting of peace and blessings from Allah, promised for them and some of their descendants. This marks the beginning of a new era for humanity, with the survivors establishing themselves. The verse also mentions that other future generations will be allowed to enjoy worldly life for a period, but will ultimately face severe consequences from Allah, highlighting the ongoing theme of accountability for choices made regarding faith and righteousness. This transitions from the immediate salvation of the believers to the future destiny of humanity.","arabic":"تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَاءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَا إِلَيْكَ ۖ مَا كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُهَا أَنْتَ وَلَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْ قَبْلِ هَٰذَا ۖ فَاصْبِرْ ۖ إِنَّ الْعَاقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"To the 'Ad People (We sent) Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: \"O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. (Your other gods) ye do nothing but invent!","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding commentary on the story of Prophet Noah and the flood, addressed to Prophet Muhammad and the people receiving the Qur'an. It emphasizes that this account is from the \"unseen,\" meaning knowledge known only to Allah, which has now been revealed through divine inspiration, as it was unknown to the Prophet and his people before this. The story serves as a historical lesson, demonstrating the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and reinforcing the truth of the message. The verse then provides encouragement for Prophet Muhammad and the believers to remain patient in the face of opposition, assuring them that the ultimate outcome and triumph belong to those who are righteous (who believe in Allah and follow His commands). This links the historical narrative back to the challenges faced by the believers at the time of the Qur'anic revelation and offers a universal principle about the final destiny of the righteous.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُودًا ۚ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ إِنْ أَنْتُمْ إِلَّا مُفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"\"O my people! I ask of you no reward for this (Message). My reward is from none but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand?","commentary":"This verse begins the account of Prophet Hud being sent to his people, the 'Ad. The Qur'an refers to him as one of their \"brethren,\" emphasizing his connection to them through lineage and community ties. Prophet Hud's message to his people was the same core message brought by all prophets: to worship Allah alone and recognize that there is no deity worthy of worship other than Him. He explained to them that the other things they worshipped were simply fabrications or inventions, having no real divine power or authority. This verse sets the stage for the conflict between Prophet Hud's call to monotheism and the existing practices of the 'Ad people.","arabic":"يَا قَوْمِ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"\"And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in repentance): He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!\"","commentary":"Following his initial call to worship Allah, Prophet Hud clarifies that his message is selfless. He tells his people that he is not seeking any personal gain or reward from them for conveying this message. His only expectation of reward is from Allah, the One who created him and provides for all beings. He challenges their understanding, implying that it is only logical to expect that a messenger from Allah would not seek worldly benefits from humans when Allah Himself is the ultimate Provider. This highlights the sincerity of the prophetic mission, contrasting it with any potential worldly motive they might attribute to him.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِدْرَارًا وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَىٰ قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلَا تَتَوَلَّوْا مُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"They said: \"O Hud! No Clear (Sign) that hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!","commentary":"Prophet Hud then offers his people a path to both spiritual and worldly well-being. He urges them to seek Allah's forgiveness for their past misdeeds and turn to Him with sincere repentance. He promises that if they do so, Allah will bless them with abundant rain, which is essential for their agriculture and sustenance, and will also increase their physical strength and prosperity. This connects their spiritual state (seeking forgiveness, repenting) directly to practical benefits in their lives (rain, strength). He warns them not to persist in their sinful ways, implying that turning away from Allah would lead to negative consequences, contrasting the blessings promised to those who repent. This verse shows how faith in Allah can bring both spiritual purity and tangible benefits in this life, according to Allah's will.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا هُودُ مَا جِئْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِي آلِهَتِنَا عَنْ قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"\"We say nothing but that (perhaps) some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility.\" He said: \"I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him,","commentary":"The response of the 'Ad people is one of rejection and defiance. Despite Prophet Hud's clear message and sincere appeal, they dismiss his call. They claim that he has not brought them any compelling or \"clear sign\" that would prove his message or compel them to abandon the beliefs and practices of their ancestors, specifically the worship of their traditional deities. They explicitly state that they will not give up their gods based on his words alone and that they do not believe in him as a messenger. This verse shows their deep attachment to tradition and their resistance to Prophet Hud's call for change, setting the stage for further conflict.","arabic":"إِنْ نَقُولُ إِلَّا اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ آلِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ ۗ قَالَ إِنِّي أُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ وَاشْهَدُوا أَنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"\"Other gods as partners! so scheme (your worst) against me, all of you, and give me no respite.","commentary":"Continuing their defiant response from the previous verse, the 'Ad people resort to insult. Unable or unwilling to engage with Prophet Hud's message on its merits, they suggest that his behavior and message are the result of their gods having afflicted him with madness or some evil influence. This shows their distorted understanding and dismissal of divine guidance. Prophet Hud responds immediately and powerfully. He calls upon Allah as his witness and asks them to witness as well, declaring himself completely free from the practice of associating partners with Allah (the \"sin of ascribing, to Him,\" other gods). This declaration is a clear rejection of their accusation and a firm restatement of his absolute monotheism, leading into his challenge in the next verse.","arabic":"مِنْ دُونِهِ ۖ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنْظِرُونِ"},{"verse":"55","text":"\"I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path.","commentary":"Following his declaration of absolute freedom from associating partners with Allah (mentioned at the end of the previous verse), Prophet Hud issues a bold challenge to his people. He calls on them and all their so-called partners they worship alongside Allah to gather and plot against him with all their might, without giving him any pause or rest. This defiant challenge, coming from a single man facing a powerful nation, demonstrates his immense faith and reliance solely on Allah's protection. It underscores the core issue: his commitment to Allah's absolute oneness versus their practice of associating partners with Allah.","arabic":"إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّي وَرَبِّكُمْ ۚ مَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَا ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"56","text":"\"If ye turn away,- I (at least) have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things.\"","commentary":"Prophet Hud explains the source of his strength and confidence in the face of his people's threats: his complete trust in Allah. He declares Allah to be his Lord and their Lord, asserting Allah's universal sovereignty over all beings. He uses a vivid image to describe Allah's absolute power and control, stating that there is no living creature over which Allah does not have complete command (\"hath grasp of its fore-lock\"). Despite the 'Ad people's deviation, Prophet Hud affirms that Allah's way (\"straight Path\") is just, true, and unwavering. This verse reinforces the concept of Allah's absolute power and Prophet Hud's submission and reliance upon Him.","arabic":"فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ مَا أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ إِلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَيَسْتَخْلِفُ رَبِّي قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ وَلَا تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئًا ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفِيظٌ"},{"verse":"57","text":"So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty.","commentary":"Prophet Hud delivers a final warning to his people. He makes it clear that even if they persist in their rejection of his message, he has fulfilled his duty by conveying what he was sent to deliver from Allah. He warns them that Allah has the power to replace them with another nation who would be more responsive to His guidance. He assures them that their disobedience and turning away will not diminish Allah's power or plan in any way; they cannot cause Allah \"the least\" harm. He concludes by affirming that Allah is the One who watches over and controls everything. This verse marks the end of Prophet Hud's direct appeal and warning, signifying that the time for persuasion is over and divine judgment is imminent if they do not change.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا هُودًا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنَّا وَنَجَّيْنَاهُمْ مِنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ"},{"verse":"58","text":"Such were the 'Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; And followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor.","commentary":"This verse describes the outcome of the confrontation. When Allah's judgment and decision regarding the 'Ad people were finalized and issued, Allah, out of His special mercy and grace, saved Prophet Hud and the small group of people who had believed in his message. They were delivered from the severe punishment that was about to befall the rest of the 'Ad people. This highlights Allah's justice in punishing those who reject His messengers and His mercy in saving those who believe and follow His guidance. It shows the clear separation and different destinies between the believers and the disbelievers when divine judgment occurs.","arabic":"وَتِلْكَ عَادٌ ۖ جَحَدُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَصَوْا رُسُلَهُ وَاتَّبَعُوا أَمْرَ كُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ"},{"verse":"59","text":"And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the 'Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were 'Ad the people of Hud!","commentary":"This verse serves as a summary and conclusion of the account of the 'Ad people, explaining why they faced the severe penalty mentioned in the previous verse. It states that they were known for rejecting Allah's signs and revelations and disobeying His messengers (referring specifically to Prophet Hud, but implying that rejecting one messenger is equivalent to rejecting all, as they all brought the same core message). Furthermore, it points out that instead of following Allah's guidance conveyed through His messenger, they chose to follow the directives of oppressive leaders who were arrogant and persistent in their wrongdoing. This verse underscores that their destruction was a consequence of their deliberate denial of divine truth and their submission to unjust human authority that opposed Allah's commands.","arabic":"وَأُتْبِعُوا فِي هَٰذِهِ الدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ عَادًا كَفَرُوا رَبَّهُمْ ۗ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِعَادٍ قَوْمِ هُودٍ"},{"verse":"60","text":"To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer.\"","commentary":"This verse concludes the account of the people of 'Ad and Prophet Hud. It explains that because they rejected Allah and disobeyed Prophet Hud, they were afflicted with a curse in this world and will face consequences on the Day of Judgment. It emphasizes their disappearance, as if they had never existed, serving as a strong reminder of the fate of those who reject the truth from Allah.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۚ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ هُوَ أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٌ مُجِيبٌ"},{"verse":"61","text":"They said: \"O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us.\"","commentary":"Following the story of the 'Ad, the narrative moves to the people of Thamud, who were also descendants of the believers saved with Prophet Noah. Allah sent Prophet Salih, one of their own community, to them. Prophet Salih delivered the same core message as previous prophets: worship Allah alone, as there is no other being worthy of worship. He reminded them that Allah created them from the earth and established them on it, urging them to seek forgiveness for their past actions and turn back to Allah. He assured them that Allah is close and responsive to those who sincerely turn to Him. This message connects directly to the theme of worshipping Allah alone, which was the central point of contention with the previous people mentioned.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا صَالِحُ قَدْ كُنْتَ فِينَا مَرْجُوًّا قَبْلَ هَٰذَا ۖ أَتَنْهَانَا أَنْ نَعْبُدَ مَا يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا وَإِنَّنَا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ"},{"verse":"62","text":"He said: \"O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?","commentary":"In response to Prophet Salih's call, the Thamud people expressed surprise and disappointment. They acknowledged that they had previously held him in high regard and placed their hopes in him due to his good character and wisdom. However, they were taken aback by his message forbidding the worship of the deities their ancestors had worshipped. They admitted to being in deep doubt and suspicion regarding the truth of his message simply because it went against the traditions of their forefathers. This highlights how adherence to tradition without critical thought can prevent people from accepting a clear message.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّي وَآتَانِي مِنْهُ رَحْمَةً فَمَنْ يَنْصُرُنِي مِنَ اللَّهِ إِنْ عَصَيْتُهُ ۖ فَمَا تَزِيدُونَنِي غَيْرَ تَخْسِيرٍ"},{"verse":"63","text":"\"And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on Allah's (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!\"","commentary":"Prophet Salih responded to their doubt by asking them to consider his position. He explained that if he had received a clear sign or evidence from Allah and had been blessed with His mercy (by being chosen as a messenger), he could not possibly disobey Allah. Disobeying Allah to satisfy their expectations would only lead to his own ruin and destruction in the sight of Allah. This emphasizes his sincerity and commitment to the truth revealed by Allah, regardless of their reaction, reinforcing the connection between a messenger's actions and Allah's will.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِي أَرْضِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ قَرِيبٌ"},{"verse":"64","text":"But they did ham-string her. So he said: \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!\"","commentary":"To provide a clear sign as requested or needed, Prophet Salih presented them with a she-camel, referring to it as \"Allah's she-camel\" and a clear symbol for them. This suggests the she-camel had extraordinary qualities that made it a distinct sign from Allah. He instructed them to let the she-camel graze freely on Allah's land and warned them severely against harming her, stating that doing so would bring a swift and devastating punishment upon them. This specific sign from Allah served as a test of their obedience and belief, connecting their actions directly to divine consequences.","arabic":"فَعَقَرُوهَا فَقَالَ تَمَتَّعُوا فِي دَارِكُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ"},{"verse":"65","text":"When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will.","commentary":"Despite the clear warning in the previous verse and the she-camel being a sign from Allah, the Thamud people defiantly harmed and killed the she-camel. Their act demonstrated their rejection and contempt for Allah's sign and Prophet Salih's message. Following this action, Prophet Salih informed them that they had only three more days to remain in their homes and enjoy their lives before the promised punishment would surely come upon them, a promise that would not fail. This short period served as a final respite before the inevitable consequence of their disbelief and rebellion.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا صَالِحًا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنَّا وَمِنْ خِزْيِ يَوْمِئِذٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ الْقَوِيُّ الْعَزِيزُ"},{"verse":"66","text":"The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning,-","commentary":"When the appointed time for the punishment arrived, Allah's decree was carried out. However, by His special grace and mercy, Allah saved Prophet Salih and the small group of people who had believed in him. They were protected from the humiliating and terrible fate that was about to befall their people. This verse highlights Allah's power and ability to enforce His will and protect His obedient servants, contrasting their salvation with the impending doom of the disbelievers described in the next verse.","arabic":"وَأَخَذَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamud rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were the Thamud!","commentary":"This verse describes the sudden and overwhelming nature of the punishment that struck the wrongdoers among the Thamud. A mighty blast or cry overtook them, bringing about their swift destruction. The description paints a grim picture: by morning, they were lying lifeless on the ground within their own homes. This punishment immediately followed the saving of Prophet Salih and the believers mentioned in the previous verse, illustrating the clear separation between the fate of the righteous and the wicked.","arabic":"كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ ثَمُودَ كَفَرُوا رَبَّهُمْ ۗ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِثَمُودَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, \"Peace!\" He answered, \"Peace!\" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.","commentary":"This verse concludes the account of the Thamud people and their punishment. It emphasizes the completeness of their destruction, stating that they were wiped out so thoroughly that it was as if they had never even lived and prospered in their homes and land. The verse explicitly states the reason for their destruction: they rejected Allah, their Lord and Sustainer. Like the 'Ad before them, the Thamud were removed from existence, serving as a powerful lesson about the consequences of rejecting Allah's message and His messengers.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جَاءَتْ رُسُلُنَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ بِالْبُشْرَىٰ قَالُوا سَلَامًا ۖ قَالَ سَلَامٌ ۖ فَمَا لَبِثَ أَنْ جَاءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ"},{"verse":"69","text":"But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: \"Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lut.\"","commentary":"This passage begins the story of Prophet Abraham, highlighting Allah's blessings upon him. It tells how messengers sent by Allah arrived at Prophet Abraham's home carrying good news. They greeted him with \"Peace,\" and he returned their greeting. Following the tradition of hospitality, especially common in that culture, Prophet Abraham quickly prepared a generous meal for his guests, offering them a roasted calf. This verse sets the scene for the significant events and divine messages that follow.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا رَأَىٰ أَيْدِيَهُمْ لَا تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً ۚ قَالُوا لَا تَخَفْ إِنَّا أُرْسِلْنَا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ"},{"verse":"70","text":"And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.","commentary":"The previous verse showed Prophet Abraham offering food to his guests. In this verse, he noticed they were not eating. This was unusual and caused him concern and apprehension, as in that culture, guests who refused to eat might be seen as having ill intentions or not trusting their host. To alleviate his fear, the messengers revealed their true identity – they were not ordinary humans – and explained the purpose of their mission: they had been sent by Allah with a task concerning the people of Prophet Lot, who was Prophet Abraham's nephew. This revelation signals a shift in the narrative, connecting Prophet Abraham's story to the impending fate of Prophet Lot's community.","arabic":"وَامْرَأَتُهُ قَائِمَةٌ فَضَحِكَتْ فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِإِسْحَاقَ وَمِنْ وَرَاءِ إِسْحَاقَ يَعْقُوبَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"She said: \"Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!\"","commentary":"While this exchange was happening, Prophet Abraham's wife was standing nearby. She reacted by laughing. Immediately following this, the messengers conveyed extraordinary news to her directly from Allah: she would give birth to a son named Isaac, and after him, she would have a grandson named Jacob (who is also a prophet). This news is presented alongside the messengers' revelation about their mission regarding Prophet Lot's people, contrasting the theme of divine blessing and continuity (through Prophet Abraham's lineage) with that of impending divine punishment (on Prophet Lot's people).","arabic":"قَالَتْ يَا وَيْلَتَىٰ أَأَلِدُ وَأَنَا عَجُوزٌ وَهَٰذَا بَعْلِي شَيْخًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عَجِيبٌ"},{"verse":"72","text":"They said: \"Dost thou wonder at Allah's decree? The grace of Allah and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!\"","commentary":"Following the good news of the previous verse, Prophet Abraham's wife expressed her utter astonishment and disbelief. She highlighted the fact that both she and her husband, Prophet Abraham, were very old. Given their advanced age, the prospect of having a child seemed naturally impossible to her, describing it as truly \"wonderful\" or amazing in the sense of being unbelievable under normal circumstances.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۖ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ ۚ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ"},{"verse":"73","text":"When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut's people.","commentary":"Responding to Prophet Abraham's wife's astonishment in the previous verse, the messengers questioned why she would marvel at something determined by Allah. They reminded her and Prophet Abraham that Allah's grace and blessings were upon their household. Their words emphasize that nothing is impossible for Allah's power and will, and that He is deserving of all praise and glory. This statement clarifies that while natural laws exist, they are subject to Allah's ultimate will, and He can bring about events that defy ordinary expectations as a manifestation of His power and blessing.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الرَّوْعُ وَجَاءَتْهُ الْبُشْرَىٰ يُجَادِلُنَا فِي قَوْمِ لُوطٍ"},{"verse":"74","text":"For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to Allah.","commentary":"After Prophet Abraham's initial fear subsided (once the messengers' identity and purpose regarding Prophet Lot's people were revealed in verse 70) and he had received the happy news (about his future descendants in verse 71), his thoughts turned to Prophet Lot and his community. Out of compassion, Prophet Abraham began to plead with the messengers on behalf of Prophet Lot's people, hoping for their salvation or a reprieve from the impending punishment. This verse highlights Prophet Abraham's caring nature, which is further elaborated in the following verse.","arabic":"إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُنِيبٌ"},{"verse":"75","text":"O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back!","commentary":"This verse provides insight into Prophet Abraham's character, explaining the motivation behind his pleading for Prophet Lot's people mentioned in the previous verse. It describes him as exceptionally forbearing (patient and lenient), deeply compassionate, and consistently turning to Allah in devotion and prayer. These noble qualities made it difficult for him to accept the destruction of an entire community without interceding for them.","arabic":"يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَٰذَا ۖ إِنَّهُ قَدْ جَاءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ ۖ وَإِنَّهُمْ آتِيهِمْ عَذَابٌ غَيْرُ مَرْدُودٍ"},{"verse":"76","text":"When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: \"This is a distressful day.\"","commentary":"This verse provides Allah's response to Prophet Abraham's pleading (described in verses 74-75). The message is clear and final: Prophet Abraham should stop his intercession because Allah's decision regarding Prophet Lot's people has been made. It explains that an unavoidable and irreversible punishment has been decreed for them. This verse establishes the boundary of divine mercy in the face of persistent wrongdoing and highlights that some divine decrees, once issued, cannot be altered through human or even prophetic intercession.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَتْ رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا سِيءَ بِهِمْ وَضَاقَ بِهِمْ ذَرْعًا وَقَالَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَصِيبٌ"},{"verse":"77","text":"And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?\"","commentary":"Shifting the scene from Prophet Abraham's household to Prophet Lot's town, this verse describes the arrival of the messengers (angels in human form) to Prophet Lot. Knowing the wicked nature of his people and their hostility towards strangers, especially young men, Prophet Lot was immediately filled with distress and anxiety for his guests. He felt powerless to protect them from the potential harm his community might inflict, lamenting that this was a deeply troubling day for him.","arabic":"وَجَاءَهُ قَوْمُهُ يُهْرَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ وَمِنْ قَبْلُ كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ ۚ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ بَنَاتِي هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ ۖ فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُخْزُونِ فِي ضَيْفِي ۖ أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَشِيدٌ"},{"verse":"78","text":"They said: \"Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Lot's apprehension in the previous verse, his worst fears were quickly realized as his people came rushing towards his house with wicked intent. The verse notes that they had a long history of engaging in offensive and unnatural practices. Prophet Lot bravely confronted them, appealing to their sense of morality and offering them a pure and natural alternative – to marry his daughters (in a proper, lawful way). He urged them to fear Allah and show respect for his guests, pleading with them not to disgrace him. He desperately sought if there was even one person among them who possessed reason and a sound conscience, highlighting the extent of their moral corruption.","arabic":"قَالُوا لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِي بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ"},{"verse":"79","text":"He said: \"Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the difficult conversation between Prophet Lot and his people. After Prophet Lot offered them a pure and natural way to satisfy their desires by marrying his daughters (as mentioned in the previous verse), his people rejected his offer outright. They stated clearly that they had no interest in women, emphasizing that Prophet Lot knew exactly what they wanted – their desire was specifically for men. This highlights their deep-seated perversion and refusal to accept a natural way of life.","arabic":"قَالَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي بِكُمْ قُوَّةً أَوْ آوِي إِلَىٰ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ"},{"verse":"80","text":"(The Messengers) said: \"O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?\"","commentary":"Overwhelmed by the persistence and brazenness of his people, and feeling isolated and unable to protect his guests, Prophet Lot expressed his profound distress. He wished he had the strength or a powerful support system to resist them. This moment shows his human struggle and feeling of helplessness in the face of widespread evil. It reflects his longing for the ability to defend truth and morality against overwhelming corruption.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا لُوطُ إِنَّا رُسُلُ رَبِّكَ لَنْ يَصِلُوا إِلَيْكَ ۖ فَأَسْرِ بِأَهْلِكَ بِقِطْعٍ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ وَلَا يَلْتَفِتْ مِنْكُمْ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا امْرَأَتَكَ ۖ إِنَّهُ مُصِيبُهَا مَا أَصَابَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ مَوْعِدَهُمُ الصُّبْحُ ۚ أَلَيْسَ الصُّبْحُ بِقَرِيبٍ"},{"verse":"81","text":"When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-","commentary":"Responding to Prophet Lot's distress and his wish for support (mentioned in the previous verse), the visitors revealed their true identity: they were messengers from Allah. They reassured him that his people would not be able to harm him or them. They instructed him to leave the city with his family during the night, before dawn, and warned everyone not to look back as they departed. His wife, however, was excluded from this command, as she would suffer the same fate as the people of the city, indicating her alignment with their ways. The messengers then informed Prophet Lot that the time for the people's punishment was set for the morning, adding rhetorically, \"Is not the morning nigh?\", a phrase meant to comfort Prophet Lot by signifying that the end of his trial and the people's wickedness was very close.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَالِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِنْ سِجِّيلٍ مَنْضُودٍ"},{"verse":"82","text":"Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong!","commentary":"Following the instructions given in the previous verse, Prophet Lot and his believing family left the city before morning. This verse describes the terrible punishment that befell the people when Allah's decree was issued. The towns were completely destroyed, depicted dramatically as being turned upside down. Additionally, a severe rain of stones, described as being like hard, baked clay and falling in continuous layers, was sent upon them. This devastating act wiped out the entire community for their persistent wrongdoing and perversion, serving as a stark consequence of their actions.","arabic":"مُسَوَّمَةً عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ ۖ وَمَا هِيَ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ"},{"verse":"83","text":"To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu'aib, one of their own brethren: he said: \"O my people! worship Allah: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass (you) all round.","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the stones mentioned in the previous verse, adding that they were \"marked out as from your Lord,\" indicating they were specifically designated by Allah for this punishment. The verse concludes with a universal warning: such punishment is not limited to Prophet Lot's people but is always near for anyone who persists in similar wrongdoing. This serves as a reminder that persistent defiance of divine guidance and moral boundaries can lead to severe consequences from Allah, affecting all those who choose the path of injustice and corruption.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا ۚ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ وَلَا تَنْقُصُوا الْمِكْيَالَ وَالْمِيزَانَ ۚ إِنِّي أَرَاكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ وَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُحِيطٍ"},{"verse":"84","text":"\"And O my people! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief.","commentary":"This verse introduces Prophet Shu'aib, who was sent by Allah to the people of Madyan. As is common with prophets, he was from among their own community. His message begins with the fundamental principle of faith: worshipping Allah alone, recognizing that there is no deity worthy of worship other than Him. Immediately following this spiritual command, he addresses a practical matter: the people's business dealings. He tells them not to cheat in measure or weight. Prophet Shu'aib notes that they are currently enjoying prosperity, but warns them that their dishonest practices could lead to a severe consequence from Allah, a punishment that would surround them completely. This shows that in Islam, faith in Allah is directly connected to ethical conduct in all aspects of life, including business.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ أَوْفُوا الْمِكْيَالَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءَهُمْ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"\"That which is left you by Allah is best for you, if ye (but) believed! but I am not set over you to keep watch!\"","commentary":"Building on the previous verse's prohibition against cheating, Prophet Shu'aib now gives a positive command: to give full and just measure and weight. He expands this to a broader principle of fairness, urging his people not to deprive others of anything that is rightfully theirs. This instruction goes beyond just trading practices to encompass fairness in all dealings. He also warns them against spreading corruption in the land through harmful actions. This verse reinforces the idea that true faith and submission to Allah (mentioned in the previous verse) should manifest in righteous behavior and a commitment to justice and order in society.","arabic":"بَقِيَّتُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ ۚ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ"},{"verse":"86","text":"They said: \"O Shu'aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!\"","commentary":"Prophet Shu'aib continues his plea by emphasizing that the blessings and provision that come directly from Allah, acquired through honest and just means, are far better and more lasting for them if they truly believe. This contrasts with the ill-gotten gains from cheating, which might seem profitable in the short term but are ultimately detrimental. He concludes this part of his message by clarifying his role: he is a messenger conveying Allah's guidance, not a guardian appointed to force them or constantly monitor their actions. This highlights the individual responsibility each person bears for their choices and their consequences before Allah.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا شُعَيْبُ أَصَلَاتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ نَتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا أَوْ أَنْ نَفْعَلَ فِي أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَاءُ ۖ إِنَّكَ لَأَنْتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ"},{"verse":"87","text":"He said: \"O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look.","commentary":"This verse records the response of the people of Madyan, which reveals their misunderstanding or perhaps wilful rejection of Prophet Shu'aib's message. They question whether his teachings, specifically his practice of prayer which signifies devotion to Allah, are commanding them to abandon the traditional worship of their forefathers and to stop managing their property and wealth as they please. Their question demonstrates a separation in their minds between religious rituals (like prayer) and matters of economics and tradition. They end their statement with sarcasm, referring to him as \"clement and right-minded,\" implying they believe he is the opposite, given that his message challenges their established practices and beliefs. This response sets up the next part of the dialogue where Prophet Shu'aib clarifies his position and the nature of his message.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّي وَرَزَقَنِي مِنْهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا ۚ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَىٰ مَا أَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ ۚ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلَّا الْإِصْلَاحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ ۚ وَمَا تَوْفِيقِي إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ ۚ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ"},{"verse":"88","text":"\"And O my people! let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you!","commentary":"Responding to their sarcastic questioning in the previous verse, Prophet Shu'aib explains the basis of his message and his intentions. He asks them to consider that he acts upon clear guidance from his Lord, Allah, who has also provided him with good and pure sustenance. This implies that his prosperity, unlike theirs, is not based on cheating. He assures them that he is not forbidding them from dishonest practices for his own personal gain or to secretly engage in them himself; he genuinely desires their improvement and well-being. He humbly acknowledges that his ability to achieve this betterment and succeed in his prophetic mission comes solely from Allah. He places his trust in Allah and turns to Him for support. This response emphasizes the divine origin of his message and his sincere motivation for their welfare, correcting their misconception about his motives.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ لَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِي أَنْ يُصِيبَكُمْ مِثْلُ مَا أَصَابَ قَوْمَ نُوحٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ هُودٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ صَالِحٍ ۚ وَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِنْكُمْ بِبَعِيدٍ"},{"verse":"89","text":"\"But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness.\"","commentary":"After explaining his divine mandate and sincere intentions in the previous verse, Prophet Shu'aib offers a stark warning. He advises his people not to let their opposition and disagreement with him lead them to commit sins (by rejecting Allah's message and continuing their corrupt ways), which could result in a fate similar to that of earlier nations who rejected their prophets. He specifically mentions the people of Prophet Noah, Prophet Hud (who was sent to the 'Ad), and Prophet Salih (who was sent to the Thamud). He adds a reminder that the people of Prophet Lot, who were destroyed for their wickedness, were not geographically or historically far from them, implying their fate is a recent and nearby example they should heed. This serves as a severe admonition, urging them to reflect on the consequences of rejecting Allah's warnings.","arabic":"وَاسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي رَحِيمٌ وَدُودٌ"},{"verse":"90","text":"They said: \"O Shu'aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position!\"","commentary":"Following the strong warning in the previous verse about the fate of disobedient nations, Prophet Shu'aib immediately opens the door to hope and mercy. He urges his people to seek forgiveness from Allah for their past sins and to turn to Him in sincere repentance. He assures them that Allah is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness towards those who turn back to Him. This shows the balance in Islamic teaching: warning about consequence is coupled with the invitation to repentance and the assurance of Allah's boundless mercy for those who choose the path of righteousness. It's a final, tender appeal before their ultimate rejection is fully revealed.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا شُعَيْبُ مَا نَفْقَهُ كَثِيرًا مِمَّا تَقُولُ وَإِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفًا ۖ وَلَوْلَا رَهْطُكَ لَرَجَمْنَاكَ ۖ وَمَا أَنْتَ عَلَيْنَا بِعَزِيزٍ"},{"verse":"91","text":"He said: \"O my people! is then my family of more consideration with you than Allah? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do!","commentary":"Despite Prophet Shu'aib's clear message, explanations, warnings, and invitations to repentance, his people respond dismissively. They claim they don't understand much of what he is saying, highlighting their unwillingness to grasp the spiritual and ethical principles he is presenting. Their focus is entirely materialistic and tribal. They state that they perceive him as having no significant power or influence among them. They even threaten to stone him, indicating that only the respect or fear they have for his family or clan is preventing them from harming him. They explicitly tell him he holds no position of great respect in their eyes. This response starkly illustrates their reliance on worldly strength and status rather than divine authority or moral truth, setting the stage for Prophet Shu'aib's final, powerful response.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَهْطِي أَعَزُّ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَاتَّخَذْتُمُوهُ وَرَاءَكُمْ ظِهْرِيًّا ۖ إِنَّ رَبِّي بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ"},{"verse":"92","text":"\"And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! and watch ye! for I too am watching with you!\"","commentary":"Reacting to their statement in the previous verse that they value his family more than Allah's power and threat, Prophet Shu'aib expresses his astonishment and dismay. He challenges their perspective directly: do they hold his human family in higher regard and fear than Allah? He points out their contemptuous attitude towards Allah, describing it with the vivid image of casting Him away behind their backs. He then warns them that their actions and their disregard for Allah do not escape His notice or power. He declares that Allah encompasses everything they do, meaning He is fully aware of and has complete power over all their affairs. This verse powerfully contrasts their misplaced reliance on human strength with the ultimate, all-encompassing power of Allah.","arabic":"وَيَا قَوْمِ اعْمَلُوا عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّي عَامِلٌ ۖ سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ ۖ وَارْتَقِبُوا إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ رَقِيبٌ"},{"verse":"93","text":"When Our decree issued, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him, by (special) mercy from Ourselves: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-","commentary":"Following their outright rejection and challenge to his authority in previous verses, and having emphasized Allah's ultimate power in Verse 92, Prophet Shu'aib now issues a final, definitive challenge. He tells his people to go ahead and do whatever they are capable of doing, and he will continue his mission as commanded by Allah. This signifies a clear separation between them; there is no longer common ground. He tells them that they will soon find out who will be struck by a humiliating punishment and who among them (either him or themselves) is the liar regarding the truth of the message and its consequences. He instructs them to watch for the outcome, just as he will be watching. This declaration marks the culmination of the exchange, signaling that the time for dialogue and warning has ended, and the stage is set for Allah's judgment to manifest.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed (from sight) as were removed the Thamud!","commentary":"This verse follows the preceding account of Prophet Shu'ayb's efforts to guide his people in Madyan, who rejected his message and his call for fair business practices rooted in faith in Allah. It describes the consequence of their rejection. When Allah's judgment was decreed, Prophet Shu'ayb and the believers who followed him were saved by Allah's mercy. However, the wrongdoers among his people were overtaken by a devastating sound or blast. This divine punishment caused them to fall lifeless, found prostrate in their homes the following morning.","arabic":"كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا ۗ أَلَا بُعْدًا لِمَدْيَنَ كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ"},{"verse":"95","text":"And we sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest,","commentary":"Building on the previous verse which described their destruction, this verse emphasizes the completeness of the punishment that befell the people of Madyan. The impact was so total that it was as if they had never lived and prospered in their homes. It serves as a reminder that rejecting Allah's guidance can lead to utter ruin, leaving no trace behind. The verse explicitly draws a parallel between the fate of the people of Madyan and the fate of the Thamud (people of Prophet Salih), who were also destroyed for their disbelief, highlighting a consistent pattern in history for those who persist in rejecting Allah's messengers and commands.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"96","text":"Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right (guide).","commentary":"Transitioning from the story of Prophet Shu'ayb, this verse introduces the beginning of the account of Prophet Moses. Allah states that He sent Prophet Moses with clear signs – miracles and proofs – and with a manifest authority, meaning undeniable evidence of his divine mission. This establishes Prophet Moses' role as a messenger sent by Allah with undeniable credentials, setting the stage for his mission.","arabic":"إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَاتَّبَعُوا أَمْرَ فِرْعَوْنَ ۖ وَمَا أَمْرُ فِرْعَوْنَ بِرَشِيدٍ"},{"verse":"97","text":"He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire (as cattle are led to water): But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!","commentary":"This verse continues the narrative from the previous one, specifying to whom Prophet Moses was sent: Pharaoh, the powerful ruler of Egypt, and his leaders. It describes their reaction to Prophet Moses' clear signs and authority. Despite the clear evidence, they chose to follow Pharaoh's command instead of accepting Allah's message brought by Prophet Moses. The verse points out that Pharaoh's command was not righteous or a source of right guidance; by following him, they actively chose misguidance over the truth presented by Allah's messenger.","arabic":"يَقْدُمُ قَوْمَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ النَّارَ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْوِرْدُ الْمَوْرُودُ"},{"verse":"98","text":"And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!","commentary":"Following from their choice in the previous verse to blindly follow Pharaoh instead of Allah's guidance, this verse describes the consequence for Pharaoh and his followers on the Day of Judgment. Because they followed him in this life, Pharaoh will lead them to the Fire in the afterlife, much like how one might lead cattle to a destination. This imagery emphasizes their blind obedience and the dire outcome. The verse concludes by stating how terrible that destination will be, a consequence of their rejection of Allah's message and their choice to follow a misguided leader.","arabic":"وَأُتْبِعُوا فِي هَٰذِهِ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ بِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ"},{"verse":"99","text":"These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time).","commentary":"This verse reinforces the severe consequences faced by Pharaoh and his people for rejecting Prophet Moses and following Pharaoh's unrighteous path, as described in the previous verses. It states that they were subject to a curse, meaning removal from Allah's mercy, both in this life and will continue to be so on the Day of Judgment. The verse grimly refers to this continuous state of rejection and punishment as a \"gift,\" highlighting the terrible reality of their ultimate fate as a result of their choices. This underscores the lasting and devastating impact of choosing disobedience over Allah's guidance.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَاءِ الْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّهُ عَلَيْكَ ۖ مِنْهَا قَائِمٌ وَحَصِيدٌ"},{"verse":"100","text":"It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities, other than Allah, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!","commentary":"These verses summarize the accounts of past communities that have been mentioned earlier in this chapter. They serve as lessons for those who hear them. Some of these communities still have visible remnants of their existence, like ruins, while others have been completely wiped out, leaving no trace, similar to a field that has been harvested.","arabic":"وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۖ فَمَا أَغْنَتْ عَنْهُمْ آلِهَتُهُمُ الَّتِي يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ لَمَّا جَاءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ ۖ وَمَا زَادُوهُمْ غَيْرَ تَتْبِيبٍ"},{"verse":"101","text":"Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement.","commentary":"This verse clarifies that the destruction of those communities was not an act of injustice from Allah. Rather, it was a consequence of their own actions. They chose to turn away from the guidance sent to them and worshipped things other than Allah. When Allah's judgment came, the false objects of worship they relied upon were completely useless to them; they could offer no protection or benefit. Their reliance on these false deities only led them to ruin. This emphasizes that accountability for one's choices ultimately rests with the individual. This connects to the previous verse by explaining *why* some communities were destroyed, showing the principle behind their fate.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ۚ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ"},{"verse":"102","text":"In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony.","commentary":"This verse describes the nature of Allah's punishment for communities that persist in wrongdoing and injustice. It highlights that punishment is sent when a community is deeply involved in evil and corruption, and it is described as severe. This serves as a warning about the consequences of collective wrongdoing and sets the stage for the next verses which connect worldly consequences to accountability in the hereafter.","arabic":"إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِمَنْ خَافَ عَذَابَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَجْمُوعٌ لَهُ النَّاسُ وَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَشْهُودٌ"},{"verse":"103","text":"Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed.","commentary":"Following the mention of the severe punishment that befell past communities in this world (Verse 102), this verse points out that these historical events contain a significant lesson, or \"sign.\" This sign is particularly clear for those who are conscious of and concerned about the consequences they might face in the life after death. The verse then introduces the Day of Judgment, describing it as a day when all humanity will be brought together and when everyone's actions and choices will be witnessed and accounted for. This serves as a transition from the historical accounts to the ultimate accountability in the hereafter.","arabic":"وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلَّا لِأَجَلٍ مَعْدُودٍ"},{"verse":"104","text":"The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed.","commentary":"This verse reassures that the Day of Judgment (mentioned in the previous verse) will definitely come to pass. It states that Allah will not postpone this day beyond a specific time that has already been determined. This adds certainty to the reality of the future gathering and accountability described in Verse 103.","arabic":"يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِيٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ"},{"verse":"105","text":"Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs:","commentary":"Continuing the description of the Day of Judgment introduced in Verse 103, this verse portrays a scene of immense solemnity. When that appointed day arrives, there will be absolute stillness and silence; no individual will be able to utter a single word unless Allah permits it. In this grand assembly, humanity will be clearly divided into two distinct groups: those who are destined for hardship and those who will receive great favor. This division highlights the outcome of the accountability described earlier.","arabic":"فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ شَقُوا فَفِي النَّارِ لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ"},{"verse":"106","text":"They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth.","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the fate of the first group mentioned in the previous verse – those who are described as wretched. It states that they will be in the Fire, and depicts their state as one filled with distress, audible through sounds of heavy breathing, sighs, and sobs. This provides a stark contrast to the state of the blessed, which is described in the following verses.","arabic":"خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ رَبُّكَ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ فَعَّالٌ لِمَا يُرِيدُ"},{"verse":"107","text":"And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: a gift without break.","commentary":"This verse describes the duration of the stay for those in the Fire, as mentioned in Verse 106. It uses an expression implying a very long, enduring period – \"as long as the heavens and the earth endure.\" This conveys a sense of permanence. However, it also includes the crucial qualification, \"except as your Lord wills,\" which emphasizes Allah's absolute and unrestricted power and will over all things, including the duration of consequences. The verse concludes by stating that Allah is indeed capable of fulfilling whatever He intends.","arabic":"وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ سُعِدُوا فَفِي الْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ رَبُّكَ ۖ عَطَاءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before (them): but verily We shall pay them back (in full) their portion without (the least) abatement.","commentary":"In contrast to the description of the wretched (Verses 106-107), this verse describes the fate of the second group mentioned in Verse 105 – those who are blessed. It states that they will be in the Garden (Paradise). Similar to the fate of the wretched, their dwelling is described with the phrase \"as long as the heavens and the earth endure,\" again conveying a sense of permanence, also qualified by \"except as your Lord wills,\" reinforcing Allah's ultimate authority. The verse emphasizes the nature of their abode as a continuous and uninterrupted gift, highlighting the bounty they receive as a result of their choices and Allah's favor.","arabic":"فَلَا تَكُ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِمَّا يَعْبُدُ هَٰؤُلَاءِ ۚ مَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُهُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۚ وَإِنَّا لَمُوَفُّوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ غَيْرَ مَنْقُوصٍ"},{"verse":"109","text":"We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it.","commentary":"Drawing a parallel between the ancient communities discussed and the people the Prophet was addressing who rejected his message, this verse advises not to have any doubt about the invalidity of the worship practiced by those who reject the truth. It points out that their practice is merely following what their ancestors did, without a valid basis. It then asserts that Allah will surely give them their full due, meaning they will face the consequences of their choices, just as past communities did. This connects the lessons from history and the reality of the Day of Judgment (described in previous verses) to the situation of those who were opposing the message at the time, affirming the certainty of accountability.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ فَاخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ ۚ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِنْ رَبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِنْهُ مُرِيبٍ"},{"verse":"110","text":"And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back (in full the recompense) of their deeds: for He knoweth well all that they do.","commentary":"This verse follows the previous discussion about how communities that reject divine guidance face consequences. Here, Allah mentions Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and the Scripture given to him (the Torah). We are told that after the Torah was given, disagreements and disputes arose among the people regarding its meaning and application. Allah explains that if it weren't for a prior decree from Him, the matter of their differences and disputes would have been immediately judged and settled. However, because of that decree, their accountability was deferred. It also notes that they remained in doubt about the Scripture given to them. This verse serves as a reminder that divine guidance has often been met with disagreement, yet Allah's wisdom determines the timing of judgment.","arabic":"وَإِنَّ كُلًّا لَمَّا لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ رَبُّكَ أَعْمَالَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"111","text":"Therefore stand firm (in the straight Path) as thou art commanded,- thou and those who with thee turn (unto Allah); and transgress not (from the Path): for He seeth well all that ye do.","commentary":"Following the mention of the people of Prophet Moses and their disputes being deferred (Verse 110), this verse emphasizes that despite any delay in worldly consequences, Allah will ultimately hold everyone accountable and give them the full recompense for their actions, whether good or bad. It confirms that Allah is fully aware of everything people do, ensuring that nothing is overlooked and justice will be perfectly rendered. This connects back to the theme of accountability highlighted in earlier verses and prepares the listener for the instructions given to the Prophet and believers in the verses that follow.","arabic":"فَاسْتَقِمْ كَمَا أُمِرْتَ وَمَنْ تَابَ مَعَكَ وَلَا تَطْغَوْا ۚ إِنَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"112","text":"And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped.","commentary":"After discussing the ultimate accountability of all people for their deeds (Verse 111), this verse turns to the Prophet and those who have sincerely turned to Allah (repented and followed the faith). It instructs them to remain steadfast and upright on the path that Allah has commanded. This involves adhering strictly to divine guidance without deviating or going to extremes, either by being too lax or overly rigid. The phrase \"transgress not\" warns against exceeding the bounds set by Allah. The verse concludes by reminding everyone that Allah sees everything they do, reinforcing the importance of sincerity and correct conduct, linking back to the theme of divine awareness from the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَا تَرْكَنُوا إِلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا فَتَمَسَّكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ثُمَّ لَا تُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember (their Lord):","commentary":"Following the command to stand firm on the right path (Verse 112), this verse provides a crucial warning: do not lean towards or support those who do wrong or commit injustice. This includes those who oppress others or associate partners with Allah. The warning is severe, stating that associating with or showing support for such wrongdoers could lead to receiving a similar punishment in the Fire. It emphasizes that if this happens, they will find no one besides Allah to protect or help them. This highlights the importance of maintaining a clear distinction and not compromising on the principles of truth and justice.","arabic":"وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ طَرَفَيِ النَّهَارِ وَزُلَفًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ۚ إِنَّ الْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّيِّئَاتِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلذَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"And be steadfast in patience; for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.","commentary":"Building on the challenges mentioned previously, like facing opposition or the difficulty of remaining steadfast (Verse 112) and avoiding the influence of wrongdoers (Verse 113), this verse provides a practical means of support and purification: establishing regular prayers. It specifically mentions prayer at the beginning and end of the day, and during parts of the night, covering the times for the obligatory prayers. It then offers a general principle that good deeds, like prayer, help to counteract and remove the effects of evil deeds. The verse concludes by stating that this message is a reminder for those who are mindful of Allah, emphasizing the prayer itself as an act of remembrance.","arabic":"وَاصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"115","text":"Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed of balanced good sense, prohibiting (men) from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved (from harm)? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin.","commentary":"Following the instruction to pray regularly as a source of strength and purification (Verse 114), this verse gives another essential command for those striving on the right path: be patient and persevere through difficulties and opposition. The path of truth is often challenging, requiring patience and steadfastness. The verse provides a strong reassurance that Allah will never let the reward of those who do good and remain patient be lost or diminished. This encourages believers to continue doing good deeds, knowing that their efforts and sacrifices are valued and fully preserved by Allah.","arabic":"فَلَوْلَا كَانَ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ أُولُو بَقِيَّةٍ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْفَسَادِ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِمَّنْ أَنْجَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ ۗ وَاتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مَا أُتْرِفُوا فِيهِ وَكَانُوا مُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"116","text":"Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing, if its members were likely to mend.","commentary":"Shifting focus back to the lessons from past communities discussed earlier in the Sura, this verse asks why there were not enough wise and upright people in previous generations who actively worked to prevent corruption and injustice on Earth. It notes that only a small number among them were saved (presumably those who did speak out or followed the messengers). It contrasts this with the majority, the wrongdoers, who were preoccupied with worldly pleasures and stubbornly continued their sinful ways. This verse implicitly connects to the earlier warnings (like those in Verse 113) about the consequences of wrongdoing and highlights the importance of having individuals who stand up against evil in society to potentially avert divine punishment.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ لِيُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا مُصْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"117","text":"If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute.","commentary":"Following the observation about the lack of people preventing corruption in past generations (Verse 116), this verse clarifies Allah's principle regarding the destruction of communities. It states that Allah would not destroy communities solely for one type of wrongdoing if there was a likelihood that its people were willing to reform or correct their ways. This implies that divine punishment on a large scale is usually a consequence of widespread and persistent wrongdoing, especially injustice and corruption, coupled with a refusal to change or heed warnings. It reinforces the concept that Allah's judgment is based on the overall state and willingness of a community to mend its ways, rather than arbitrary destruction.","arabic":"وَلَوْ شَاءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً ۖ وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ"},{"verse":"118","text":"Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: \"I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together.\"","commentary":"Moving from the lessons of past communities and divine justice (Verses 116-117), this verse addresses the diversity and differences among people. It states that if Allah had willed, He could have created all of humanity as one single community, unified in belief and action. However, His will dictated otherwise, allowing for differences and variations among people. It then observes that because of this freedom and diversity, people naturally tend to dispute and disagree, particularly on matters of belief and the right way of life. This sets the stage for the following verse which explains the exception to this general state of disagreement.","arabic":"إِلَّا مَنْ رَحِمَ رَبُّكَ ۚ وَلِذَٰلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ ۗ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"119","text":"All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it We make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe.","commentary":"This verse continues the thought from the previous one (Verse 118) about mankind's tendency to dispute. It states that the exception to this constant disagreement are those upon whom Allah has shown His mercy. These are the individuals who are guided to the truth and are unified by sincere faith. The verse then adds that Allah created humanity with the capacity for both guidance (leading to His mercy) and deviation (leading to disagreement and potential punishment). It concludes by mentioning a decree from Allah that Hell will be filled with those from among jinn and humans who chose the path leading away from His mercy and guidance. This underscores the ultimate consequences of the choices people make in this life, linking back to the theme of accountability for deeds mentioned earlier (Verse 111).","arabic":"وَكُلًّا نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَاءِ الرُّسُلِ مَا نُثَبِّتُ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ ۚ وَجَاءَكَ فِي هَٰذِهِ الْحَقُّ وَمَوْعِظَةٌ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"120","text":"Say to those who do not believe: \"Do what ever ye can: We shall do our part;","commentary":"This verse concludes a section of the Qur'an that has shared stories of earlier prophets and the communities they were sent to. It explains the wisdom behind relating these historical accounts, particularly for Prophet Muhammad. Hearing about the experiences of past messengers, their struggles, and the outcomes for both believers and disbelievers, served to strengthen the Prophet's resolve and reassure him in his mission. These stories bring undeniable truth and serve as a lesson and a reminder for all who believe, reinforcing the consistent nature of Allah's guidance and the consequences of accepting or rejecting it. This verse sets the stage for the final message and instruction given in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَقُلْ لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ اعْمَلُوا عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ"},{"verse":"121","text":"\"And wait ye! We too shall wait.\"","commentary":"Following the explanation of the purpose of the historical narratives in the previous verse, this verse gives Prophet Muhammad a direct instruction on how to address those who stubbornly refuse to believe. It’s a firm declaration, marking a clear separation between the path of the believers and the path of those who reject the message. The Prophet is told to say to them, in essence, \"Carry on with your actions, and we will carry on with ours.\" It indicates that the arguments and warnings have been given, and now the outcome rests with Allah. This sets up the next verse which emphasizes the waiting for Allah's decision.","arabic":"وَانْتَظِرُوا إِنَّا مُنْتَظِرُونَ"},{"verse":"122","text":"To Allah do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goeth back every affair (for decision): then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.","commentary":"This verse continues the strong address to the disbelievers, building on the previous verse's declaration of differing paths. After telling them to proceed as they wish while the believers proceed on their path, this verse adds a challenge and a statement of mutual expectation: \"Wait for what is to come, and we too are waiting.\" This waiting is for Allah's ultimate judgment and the fulfillment of His promises and warnings. It signifies the end of the period of persuasion and the beginning of the waiting for Allah to decide between the two parties, as hinted at by the stories of the previous nations.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الْأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ ۚ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"123","text":"","commentary":"This verse explains *why* the instruction to wait (mentioned in the previous verse) is valid and why the believers can confidently say this. It asserts Allah's absolute knowledge and control over everything in the universe, both seen and unseen. Every matter, every outcome, ultimately returns to Allah for decision. Because all authority and knowledge belong to Allah alone, the conclusion for believers is clear: dedicate all worship and devotion to Him, and place complete trust in Him. The verse ends with a powerful reminder that Allah is fully aware of everything everyone does, assuring believers that their actions are not overlooked and warning others that nothing they do is hidden from Him. This final instruction ties back to the central theme of the entire chapter and the Qur'an – the importance of worshipping Allah alone and relying on Him.","arabic":""}];
