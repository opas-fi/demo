    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ain. Sad.","commentary":"These are individual letters of the Arabic alphabet that begin this chapter. In the Islamic tradition, these letters are understood as being part of the unique and inimitable style of the Qur'an. They are composed of the same letters available to everyone, yet the Qur'an's composition is from divine power and cannot be replicated by human effort. These letters serve as an introduction to the text that follows.","arabic":"كهيعص"},{"verse":"2","text":"(This is) a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya.","commentary":"Following the opening letters, this verse introduces the main theme of the story that begins here: an account of Allah's grace and mercy bestowed upon His servant, Prophet Zachariah. It immediately sets a tone of divine compassion that permeates the narrative that follows.","arabic":"ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ عَبْدَهُ زَكَرِيَّا"},{"verse":"3","text":"Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret,","commentary":"This verse describes Prophet Zachariah's action, setting the scene for his supplication. He called out to Allah in a secret, private manner. This highlights the personal and intimate connection a person can have with Allah, expressing their deepest concerns away from the eyes and ears of others. This secret prayer is the beginning of the story of Allah's grace introduced in the previous verse.","arabic":"إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ نِدَاءً خَفِيًّا"},{"verse":"4","text":"Praying: \"O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee!","commentary":"Continuing his secret prayer, Prophet Zachariah describes his physical condition, noting his weakened bones and grey hair, signs of advanced age and feebleness. He then acknowledges his past experience with Allah, stating that his prayers have always been answered. This expression of trust and past experience prepares for the request he is about to make, suggesting that despite his current state, he trusts Allah will answer him now, as He has before.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّي وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَائِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"5","text":"\"Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,-","commentary":"Building on the description of his old age and trust in Allah, Zachariah expresses his concern about the future. He fears that after he is gone, his relatives or colleagues might not properly manage the religious heritage and responsibilities entrusted to him, particularly those related to serving Allah's cause and looking after the people under his care. He also mentions that his wife is barren, meaning he has no child to inherit and carry on this important duty. Therefore, he asks Allah to grant him an heir as a special gift from Him. This verse presents the core need and motivation behind his prayer.","arabic":"وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِيَ مِنْ وَرَائِي وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَتِي عَاقِرًا فَهَبْ لِي مِنْ لَدُنْكَ وَلِيًّا"},{"verse":"6","text":"\"(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!\"","commentary":"Zachariah continues his request for an heir, specifying the qualities he desires in this successor. He prays for someone who will not only carry on his own responsibilities but also represent the heritage of the House of Jacob, the lineage of prophets and devout individuals from which he came. Importantly, he asks Allah to make this heir someone who is well-pleased with Allah and with whom Allah is pleased. This shows that his concern is primarily for the continuity of faith and righteous stewardship, not merely a personal legacy. This completes his earnest and detailed supplication presented across verses 3-6.","arabic":"يَرِثُنِي وَيَرِثُ مِنْ آلِ يَعْقُوبَ ۖ وَاجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيًّا"},{"verse":"7","text":"(His prayer was answered): \"O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before.\"","commentary":"Immediately after his prayer, Allah answers Prophet Zachariah. A voice from Allah's presence calls out to him, giving him the happy news that he will have a son. Allah also bestows a special kindness by naming the son \"Yahya\" (known as John in some traditions) and stating that this name has not been given to anyone before, indicating the unique status of this child. This verse is the direct, miraculous response to Zachariah's prayer, fulfilling his request despite his and his wife's advanced age and barrenness.","arabic":"يَا زَكَرِيَّا إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلَامٍ اسْمُهُ يَحْيَىٰ لَمْ نَجْعَلْ لَهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ سَمِيًّا"},{"verse":"8","text":"He said: \"O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?\"","commentary":"Upon receiving the extraordinary news, Prophet Zachariah expresses a human reaction of wonder, asking Allah how this is possible given his and his wife's physical limitations due to old age and barrenness. This question is not one of disbelief in Allah's promise, but rather a natural human desire for understanding and reassurance about the means by which this miraculous event will occur, considering the apparent reality of their situation. This follows directly from the announcement in the previous verse.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَتِي عَاقِرًا وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ الْكِبَرِ عِتِيًّا"},{"verse":"9","text":"He said: \"So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'\"","commentary":"Allah directly answers Prophet Zachariah's question from the previous verse. The response affirms that this is how it will be, emphasizing that creating a son in these circumstances is easy for Allah. To further illustrate His power, Allah reminds Zachariah that He created Zachariah himself previously when he was nothing. This highlights that Allah's power is absolute and not bound by conventional means; creating life from nothing is far more extraordinary than creating life from an aged couple, though both are easy for Allah's will.","arabic":"قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئًا"},{"verse":"10","text":"(Zakariya) said: \"O my Lord! give me a Sign.\" \"Thy Sign,\" was the answer, \"Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb.\"","commentary":"Despite the reassurance in the previous verse, Prophet Zachariah asks Allah for a sign to confirm the news and perhaps to give him a specific moment to feel the commencement of this miracle. Allah grants his request by giving him a unique sign: he will be unable to speak to people for three nights and days, even though he is not ill or physically unable to speak. This is a specific, miraculous sign marking the answer to his prayer and serving as a distinct period for him to focus on glorifying Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ لِي آيَةً ۚ قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلَّا تُكَلِّمَ النَّاسَ ثَلَاثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيًّا"},{"verse":"11","text":"So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah's praises in the morning and in the evening.","commentary":"Picking up from the previous verse, which described the sign Prophet Zachariah was given (being unable to speak to people for three days), this verse shows him leaving his private chamber. He communicated with his people using gestures or signs, directing them to praise and glorify Allah throughout the day and evening. This act of directing others to praise Allah reflected the state of gratitude and awe Prophet Zachariah was in, following the miraculous news he had received.","arabic":"فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ مِنَ الْمِحْرَابِ فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْهِمْ أَنْ سَبِّحُوا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا"},{"verse":"12","text":"(To his son came the command): \"O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might\": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,","commentary":"The narrative now shifts focus from Prophet Zachariah to his son, Prophet John (referred to as Yahya in Arabic). The passage highlights important events in John's life. Here, as a young man, he receives a direct address from Allah, instructing him to \"take hold of the Book with might.\" This refers to the divine scriptures (understood here as the Torah, which was the scripture for the prophets of the Children of Israel), and the command means to follow and uphold its teachings with strength, determination, and seriousness. The verse also mentions that Allah granted him wisdom even while he was still young, preparing him for the great task ahead.","arabic":"يَا يَحْيَىٰ خُذِ الْكِتَابَ بِقُوَّةٍ ۖ وَآتَيْنَاهُ الْحُكْمَ صَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"13","text":"And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout,","commentary":"Continuing the description of the qualities Allah bestowed upon Prophet John, this verse mentions that he was given piety, described here as compassion towards all creatures, as a special gift from Allah. He was also granted purity of heart and actions. These qualities, along with the wisdom mentioned in the previous verse, were given to him to help him fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him, including guiding others towards good and purity.","arabic":"وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً ۖ وَكَانَ تَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"14","text":"And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious.","commentary":"This verse further describes the noble character of Prophet John. It highlights his kindness and dutifulness towards his parents. It also points out that he was not arrogant or rebellious, indicating his humility and obedience, particularly towards Allah and his parents. This detail about his character completes the description of the virtues Allah had graced him with.","arabic":"وَبَرًّا بِوَالِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ جَبَّارًا عَصِيًّا"},{"verse":"15","text":"So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)!","commentary":"Concluding the brief account of Prophet John, this verse pronounces a special blessing of peace upon him from Allah at three significant points in his existence: the day he was born, the day he would die, and the day he will be resurrected. This verse brings the story of Prophet Zachariah and the miraculous birth of his son, Prophet John, to a close, emphasizing the blessed nature of John's life and destiny as determined by Allah.","arabic":"وَسَلَامٌ عَلَيْهِ يَوْمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوْمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ يُبْعَثُ حَيًّا"},{"verse":"16","text":"Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East.","commentary":"Having completed the story of Prophet John, the Qur'an transitions to the account of Mary and the birth of Prophet Jesus, which is presented as an even more remarkable event. This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad to relate the story of Mary in the Qur'an. It opens the narrative by setting the scene: Mary withdrew from her family and went to a secluded place towards the east, seeking privacy.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ انْتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَانًا شَرْقِيًّا"},{"verse":"17","text":"She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.","commentary":"Following Mary's withdrawal to a private place as mentioned in the previous verse, this verse details the next event. It describes Mary using a screen or barrier to ensure her privacy. At this moment, Allah sent His angel (identified elsewhere as Jibril or Gabriel), who appeared before her in the form of a perfect man. This unexpected appearance was understandably shocking for Mary.","arabic":"فَاتَّخَذَتْ مِنْ دُونِهِمْ حِجَابًا فَأَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهَا رُوحَنَا فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَرًا سَوِيًّا"},{"verse":"18","text":"She said: \"I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah.\"","commentary":"Reacting to the sudden appearance of a man in her private space, Mary's immediate response, as described in this verse, was to seek refuge with Allah, specifically mentioning His attribute as the Most Gracious. She appealed to the man by saying she sought protection if he feared Allah, hoping this reminder of Allah would deter any ill intention he might have. This highlights her piety and trust in Allah for protection in a moment of distress.","arabic":"قَالَتْ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَٰنِ مِنْكَ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"19","text":"He said: \"Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son.","commentary":"In response to Mary's plea for protection and her appeal based on the fear of Allah (mentioned in the previous verse), the figure identifies himself. He clarifies that he is not a threat but a messenger sent by Allah, her Lord. His purpose, he reveals, is to deliver the extraordinary news that Allah is granting her a pure and holy son. This was the surprising and significant message the angel was sent to convey.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّمَا أَنَا رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا"},{"verse":"20","text":"She said: \"How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?\"","commentary":"Responding to the angel's astonishing announcement in Verse 19, Mary expresses her confusion and disbelief. She questions how she could possibly have a son, stating clearly that no man has ever touched her (meaning she was a virgin) and affirming her chastity. Her question reflects the natural human understanding of procreation and her struggle to comprehend how this divine promise would be fulfilled outside of normal circumstances.","arabic":"قَالَتْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلَامٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا"},{"verse":"21","text":"He said: \"So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us': It is a matter (so) decreed.\"","commentary":"Following Mary's expression of surprise about having a child when no man had touched her, the angel replies by conveying the words of Allah. The angel explains that this event, seemingly impossible by normal human standards, is easy for Allah. It is a matter that Allah has already decreed. Furthermore, this miraculous birth is intended by Allah to be a profound \"Sign\" for all people, demonstrating His power and will, and also to be a \"Mercy\" from Allah, benefiting humanity.","arabic":"قَالَ كَذَٰلِكِ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ ۖ وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَرَحْمَةً مِنَّا ۚ وَكَانَ أَمْرًا مَقْضِيًّا"},{"verse":"22","text":"So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place.","commentary":"After receiving the angel's message about the decreed birth, Mary conceived Jesus. The verse then describes that she withdrew to a remote place. This suggests a period of time passed (though the duration is not specified) during which she carried the child before she moved away from her community. This act of retiring to a distant location sets the stage for the dramatic events that follow, emphasizing her isolation.","arabic":"فَحَمَلَتْهُ فَانْتَبَذَتْ بِهِ مَكَانًا قَصِيًّا"},{"verse":"23","text":"And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): \"Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!\"","commentary":"Continuing the narrative from her retreat, the verse vividly describes Mary experiencing the pains of childbirth. The intensity of the labor pains compelled her to seek support by leaning against the trunk of a palm tree. In her moment of intense physical and emotional distress, facing the prospect of delivering a child without a husband and fearing the reaction of her people, she expresses a deep wish that she had died and been forgotten before this moment. This highlights the immense challenge and suffering she was undergoing.","arabic":"فَأَجَاءَهَا الْمَخَاضُ إِلَىٰ جِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ قَالَتْ يَا لَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَٰذَا وَكُنْتُ نَسْيًا مَنْسِيًّا"},{"verse":"24","text":"But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): \"Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee;","commentary":"Immediately following Mary's cry of anguish, a voice from beneath her or nearby the palm tree offers comfort and reassurance. The voice tells her not to grieve, informing her that Allah, her Lord, has provided a source of water—a rivulet—flowing right beneath her. This is the beginning of Allah's direct miraculous provision and support for Mary in her difficult situation, immediately addressing her needs for sustenance and showing she is not abandoned. This connects to the next verse which describes further provision.","arabic":"فَنَادَاهَا مِنْ تَحْتِهَا أَلَّا تَحْزَنِي قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيًّا"},{"verse":"25","text":"\"And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee.","commentary":"The voice continues to guide Mary, instructing her to shake the trunk of the palm tree. This instruction is another miraculous intervention; despite her weakness from labor, the tree would yield fresh, ripe dates for her to eat. This provides her with essential nourishment, particularly suitable after childbirth, showing Allah's direct and immediate care for her needs in her time of isolation and vulnerability. This verse, along with the previous one about the water, provides the means for her to \"eat and drink\" mentioned in the following verse.","arabic":"وَهُزِّي إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ تُسَاقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَبًا جَنِيًّا"},{"verse":"26","text":"\"So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to (Allah) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being'\"","commentary":"Building upon the provisions mentioned in the previous verses, the voice encourages Mary to eat the dates and drink the water, finding comfort and peace of mind (\"cool your eye\"). The voice then gives her a strategy for when she inevitably encounters people. She is instructed to signal that she has taken a vow to Allah, the Most Gracious, to fast from speaking to any human being that day. This divinely given instruction provides her with a way to avoid confrontation and questioning, relying on Allah's plan for the truth to be revealed.","arabic":"فَكُلِي وَاشْرَبِي وَقَرِّي عَيْنًا ۖ فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ الْبَشَرِ أَحَدًا فَقُولِي إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ صَوْمًا فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنْسِيًّا"},{"verse":"27","text":"At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: \"O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought!","commentary":"After giving birth and receiving divine sustenance and instructions, Mary returned to her people, carrying her newborn child. This immediately caused great astonishment and shock among them, especially as they knew her to be pure and unmarried. Their reaction is expressed as finding what she has done \"truly an amazing thing,\" implying they viewed it as something dreadful or wicked, given their understanding of how children are born. This verse sets the scene for the confrontation between Mary and her community.","arabic":"فَأَتَتْ بِهِ قَوْمَهَا تَحْمِلُهُ ۖ قَالُوا يَا مَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئًا فَرِيًّا"},{"verse":"28","text":"\"O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!\"","commentary":"Addressing Mary, her people highlight her respected lineage, calling her \"Sister of Aaron.\" This reference connects her to a line known for piety and service, particularly associated with the temple. By mentioning that neither her father nor her mother were wicked or unchaste, her people are expressing their disbelief and reproach, effectively saying that her actions are completely contrary to the virtuous reputation of her family, making what she has done even more shocking and seemingly inexplicable to them.","arabic":"يَا أُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيًّا"},{"verse":"29","text":"But she pointed to the babe. They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?\"","commentary":"In response to her people's accusations and questions, Mary, following the earlier divine instruction (Verse 26), remains silent but points to the newborn child in her arms. Her gesture implies that they should address their questions to the baby. This only increases their astonishment and frustration, leading them to exclaim in disbelief, \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?\" They see it as impossible to get answers from an infant. This reaction leads directly to the miracle described in the next verse.","arabic":"فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ ۖ قَالُوا كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَنْ كَانَ فِي الْمَهْدِ صَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"30","text":"He said: \"I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet;","commentary":"Following her people's incredulous question about speaking to a baby, the miracle happens: the infant Jesus speaks from the cradle. His very first words clearly declare his identity and status. He states that he is a servant of Allah – not Allah's son or partner – and that Allah has already granted him revelation and designated him as a prophet. This statement, made immediately after birth, serves as the definitive truth about his nature and role, addressing the questions and doubts raised by his miraculous arrival.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنِّي عَبْدُ اللَّهِ آتَانِيَ الْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلَنِي نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"31","text":"\"And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live;","commentary":"This verse continues the speech of Prophet Jesus, delivered miraculously as an infant. After declaring his status as a servant of Allah and a prophet in the previous verse, he explains the blessings and responsibilities given to him by Allah. He states that Allah has made him blessed in all places and at all times. Furthermore, Allah has commanded him to establish prayer and to give charity for his entire life. This highlights key aspects of his mission and life path as ordained by Allah.","arabic":"وَجَعَلَنِي مُبَارَكًا أَيْنَ مَا كُنْتُ وَأَوْصَانِي بِالصَّلَاةِ وَالزَّكَاةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيًّا"},{"verse":"32","text":"\"(He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable;","commentary":"Continuing his infant speech, Prophet Jesus describes further qualities and commands given to him by Allah. He emphasizes that Allah has made him kind and dutiful towards his mother, Mary. He also states that Allah has protected him from being arrogant or miserable. This demonstrates the high moral character bestowed upon him from birth and his deep respect for his mother, connecting his miraculous birth to the exemplary conduct expected of him.","arabic":"وَبَرًّا بِوَالِدَتِي وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِي جَبَّارًا شَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"33","text":"\"So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)\"!","commentary":"In the final part of his infant speech, Prophet Jesus speaks of the profound peace and security granted to him by Allah. This peace is with him from the moment of his birth, will be with him on the day of his death, and will also be with him on the day he is resurrected. This statement affirms his human life cycle, including death and resurrection, which is a clear declaration of his nature as a human prophet and a servant of Allah, brought to life and brought back to life by Allah's power.","arabic":"وَالسَّلَامُ عَلَيَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدْتُ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ حَيًّا"},{"verse":"34","text":"Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute.","commentary":"Following the miraculous infant speech of Prophet Jesus (verses 30-33), this verse steps back to make an emphatic statement about his identity and the truth of his story. It affirms that this account of Jesus, the son of Mary, which includes his miraculous birth and his clear declaration of being Allah's servant and prophet, is the absolute truth. The verse notes that despite this clear truth, some people dispute it, holding conflicting and incorrect views about his nature and status. This sets the stage for addressing these disputes in the following verses.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۚ قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِي فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses some of the disputes mentioned in the previous verse, specifically refuting the idea that Allah has a son. It states that it is simply not appropriate or possible for the majesty and transcendence of Allah to have offspring, as offspring are a characteristic of creation, not the Creator. The phrase \"Glory be to Him!\" emphasizes Allah's absolute perfection and being far above any imperfections or human limitations. The verse then affirms Allah's unique power in creation: when He decides something should exist, He simply wills it by saying \"Be,\" and it comes into being instantly. This highlights that Allah's power is absolute and requires no assistance or partners, like a son.","arabic":"مَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ أَنْ يَتَّخِذَ مِنْ وَلَدٍ ۖ سُبْحَانَهُ ۚ إِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ"},{"verse":"36","text":"Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight.","commentary":"This verse quotes Prophet Jesus confirming the core truth about Allah. It states that Allah is both his Lord and the Lord of all people. Based on this fundamental truth, Prophet Jesus calls on everyone to worship Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him. He declares that this path of worshipping only Allah is the straight path, which leads to guidance and salvation. This echoes the message of all prophets and directly contradicts any claims of his divinity or being a partner to Allah, linking back to the affirmation of Allah's uniqueness in the preceding verse.","arabic":"وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ ۚ هَٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُسْتَقِيمٌ"},{"verse":"37","text":"But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day!","commentary":"Following the clear statement of truth about Prophet Jesus and the call to worship Allah alone in the previous verses, this verse returns to the disputes mentioned in verse 34. It notes that despite the clarity of the message, various groups have split and held conflicting beliefs about Jesus and his nature. The verse then issues a stern warning to those who reject the truth (the unbelievers) about the consequences they will face on a momentous and terrible Day of Judgment. This serves as a warning against deviating from the clear message presented earlier.","arabic":"فَاخْتَلَفَ الْأَحْزَابُ مِنْ بَيْنِهِمْ ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ مَشْهَدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ"},{"verse":"38","text":"How plainly will they see and hear, the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest!","commentary":"Building on the warning of the Day of Judgment in the previous verse, this verse describes the state of the unbelievers on that Day. It highlights a stark contrast: in this life, those who reject the truth are described as being in clear error, as if they cannot truly see or hear the signs leading to guidance. However, on the Day of Judgment, when they are brought before Allah, their ability to see and hear will be sharpened to an extraordinary degree, allowing them to fully perceive the reality they denied and the consequences of their actions. This contrast emphasizes their current heedlessness.","arabic":"أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا ۖ لَٰكِنِ الظَّالِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"39","text":"But warn them of the Day of Distress, when the matter will be determined: for (behold,) they are negligent and they do not believe!","commentary":"This verse reinforces the warning about the Day of Judgment, referring to it here as the \"Day of Distress,\" indicating its immense difficulty and hardship. On this Day, all matters will be settled and decided. The warning is specifically directed towards those who are currently negligent or heedless in this life and choose not to believe the truth presented to them, particularly concerning the nature of Allah and His prophets like Jesus. It urges the listener (Prophet Muhammad, upon him be peace, and by extension, all who convey the message) to warn them before that Day arrives and it is too late.","arabic":"وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned.","commentary":"Concluding this passage and the warnings about the Day of Judgment, this verse states Allah's ultimate sovereignty and control over all creation. It explains that Allah is the ultimate Heir of the earth and everything and everyone on it. This means that when all of creation perishes, Allah alone will remain. Furthermore, all beings will ultimately be returned to Allah, where they will face the judgment mentioned in the preceding verses. This serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of this life and the certainty of accountability before Allah.","arabic":"إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَرِثُ الْأَرْضَ وَمَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"41","text":"(Also mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet.","commentary":"This verse introduces the story of Prophet Abraham, whom Muslims respect as a pivotal figure and prophet of Allah. The Qur'an describes him as a \"man of Truth\" and a prophet, highlighting his unwavering belief and trustworthiness. Muslims see his story as an example of rejecting false worship and upholding the truth of Allah's oneness, following on from the previous discussion about misconceptions regarding Prophet Jesus.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صِدِّيقًا نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"42","text":"Behold, he said to his father: \"O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?","commentary":"Following the introduction in the previous verse, Prophet Abraham begins his interaction with his father. He addresses his father with deep respect, questioning the logic of worshipping idols. He points out that these idols are inanimate objects that cannot hear, see, or offer any benefit or harm, contrasting this with the nature of a true object of worship who should be greater and more powerful than humans.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ يَا أَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ وَلَا يُغْنِي عَنْكَ شَيْئًا"},{"verse":"43","text":"\"O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight.","commentary":"Continuing his gentle plea, Abraham clarifies that his perspective isn't based on personal opinion but on true knowledge granted to him directly by Allah. Despite being younger, he had received divine guidance that his father lacked. He humbly invites his father to follow him, promising to guide him to a correct and upright path based on this knowledge, building upon the questioning posed in the previous verse.","arabic":"يَا أَبَتِ إِنِّي قَدْ جَاءَنِي مِنَ الْعِلْمِ مَا لَمْ يَأْتِكَ فَاتَّبِعْنِي أَهْدِكَ صِرَاطًا سَوِيًّا"},{"verse":"44","text":"\"O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (Allah) Most Gracious.","commentary":"Abraham then directly addresses the spiritual danger of his father's actions. He explains that worshipping idols is, in effect, serving Satan, who tempts people away from the true path. He identifies Satan as a rebel against Allah, the Most Gracious, emphasizing the defiance inherent in following such a path instead of aligning oneself with the Divine Will. This serves as a strong warning after his previous gentle appeal.","arabic":"يَا أَبَتِ لَا تَعْبُدِ الشَّيْطَانَ ۖ إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ عَصِيًّا"},{"verse":"45","text":"\"O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend.\"","commentary":"Concluding his heartfelt appeal, Abraham expresses his deep fear for his father's fate. He warns that persisting in idol worship could lead to punishment from Allah, the Most Gracious. This would result in his father becoming a close associate and follower of Satan, highlighting the dire spiritual consequence of rejecting the true path and incurring Allah's displeasure.","arabic":"يَا أَبَتِ إِنِّي أَخَافُ أَنْ يَمَسَّكَ عَذَابٌ مِنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ فَتَكُونَ لِلشَّيْطَانِ وَلِيًّا"},{"verse":"46","text":"(The father) replied: \"Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!\"","commentary":"This verse records the father's harsh and arrogant response to Abraham's compassionate appeal. Instead of considering the advice, he sees Abraham's rejection of idols as an insult and a crime. He threatens Abraham with death by stoning if he doesn't stop and banishes him, illustrating the resistance truth can face from those hardened in disbelief.","arabic":"قَالَ أَرَاغِبٌ أَنْتَ عَنْ آلِهَتِي يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ ۖ لَئِنْ لَمْ تَنْتَهِ لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ ۖ وَاهْجُرْنِي مَلِيًّا"},{"verse":"47","text":"Abraham said: \"Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious.","commentary":"Despite his father's cruel rejection and threats in the previous verse, Abraham maintains his respectful and gentle demeanor. He replies with words of peace and promises to pray to Allah for his father's forgiveness and guidance. He expresses his confidence in Allah's grace towards him, showing his reliance on Allah even in this difficult situation.","arabic":"قَالَ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ ۖ سَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّي ۖ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِي حَفِيًّا"},{"verse":"48","text":"\"And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest.\"","commentary":"Following his father's demand for him to leave and maintaining his peaceful response from the previous verse, Abraham states his decision. He announces that he will withdraw from them and from the false deities they worship instead of Allah. He declares his intention to worship and call solely upon Allah, expressing hope that by doing so, he will be blessed and protected from misery and the withdrawal of blessings.","arabic":"وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَأَدْعُو رَبِّي عَسَىٰ أَلَّا أَكُونَ بِدُعَاءِ رَبِّي شَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"49","text":"When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet.","commentary":"This verse shows the consequence of Abraham's decision and action mentioned in the previous verse. After he left his family and their idols, Allah compensated him by granting him righteous offspring: his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, both of whom were also chosen by Allah as prophets. This highlights Allah's reward for Abraham's sacrifice and unwavering devotion.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۖ وَكُلًّا جَعَلْنَا نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"50","text":"And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth.","commentary":"Building on the blessings mentioned in the previous verse, this verse elaborates on the favors Allah bestowed upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their descendants. It emphasizes Allah's abundant mercy towards them, a central theme in this surah. Additionally, they were granted high honor through conveying the truth, meaning they were truthful in their prophetic missions and respected for it among people.","arabic":"وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُمْ مِنْ رَحْمَتِنَا وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ عَلِيًّا"},{"verse":"51","text":"Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.","commentary":"This verse introduces the story of Prophet Moses. It tells us that he was specially chosen by Allah for a great task. It also identifies him as both a messenger, meaning he was given a divine message to deliver to people, and a prophet, who receives direct communication from Allah. This continues the theme of highlighting prophets and their connection to Allah, following the accounts of earlier prophets.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ مُوسَىٰ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ مُخْلَصًا وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"52","text":"And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse).","commentary":"Continuing the story of Prophet Moses, this verse describes a significant event where Allah called out to him from the right side of Mount Sinai. It also mentions that Allah brought him near for converse or communion. In Islam, we affirm that this happened as described, acknowledging Allah's ability to communicate with His prophets in ways beyond our full human comprehension. This event was a profound experience that prepared Moses for the heavy responsibilities that lay ahead.","arabic":"وَنَادَيْنَاهُ مِنْ جَانِبِ الطُّورِ الْأَيْمَنِ وَقَرَّبْنَاهُ نَجِيًّا"},{"verse":"53","text":"And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet.","commentary":"This verse highlights Allah's mercy towards Moses by granting him the support of his brother, Aaron. Aaron was also made a prophet. This was a response to Moses' need for assistance in his mission, particularly because Aaron was known to be more eloquent. This shows how Allah provides support and help to His messengers in fulfilling their difficult tasks, and it emphasizes divine mercy within the narrative of prophethood.","arabic":"وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِنْ رَحْمَتِنَا أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"54","text":"Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma'il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.","commentary":"Moving on, this verse introduces Prophet Ishmael. It points out a key quality of his character: he was always true to his promise. This is a quality shared by all prophets, but its specific mention here suggests its particular importance in his story. Like Moses, he is described as both a messenger and a prophet, indicating he received and delivered Allah's message. This verse shifts focus to another significant line of prophets descended from Prophet Abraham.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَادِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"55","text":"He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord.","commentary":"This verse continues the description of Ishmael, detailing some of the fundamental aspects of his mission. He commanded his family and people to observe prayer and charity. These are core practices in the worship of Allah that have been part of the teachings of prophets throughout history. The verse concludes by stating that he earned Allah's pleasure, signifying his dedication and the acceptance of his efforts. This builds upon the previous verse's introduction of Ishmael's character and role.","arabic":"وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَالزَّكَاةِ وَكَانَ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيًّا"},{"verse":"56","text":"Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:","commentary":"The passage then introduces Prophet Idris. He is described as a man of truth and a prophet. Like the prophets mentioned before him, this highlights his deep connection with divine guidance and his role in conveying truth to humanity. The Qur'an provides concise information about him, emphasizing these core attributes.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ إِدْرِيسَ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صِدِّيقًا نَبِيًّا"},{"verse":"57","text":"And We raised him to a lofty station.","commentary":"Following the introduction of Idris in the previous verse, this verse states that Allah raised him to a lofty station. This signifies the honor and elevated status granted to him by Allah due to his truthfulness and prophethood. Islamic belief accepts this statement as revealed in the Qur'an, affirming the special honor Allah bestowed upon Prophet Idris.","arabic":"وَرَفَعْنَاهُ مَكَانًا عَلِيًّا"},{"verse":"58","text":"Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (Allah) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears.","commentary":"This verse provides a summary of the prophets and righteous individuals mentioned and others like them. It traces their lineage back to key figures in human history: Adam, those saved in Prophet Noah's Ark, and the descendants of Prophet Abraham and his grandson Israel (also known as Jacob). It describes a shared characteristic of these guided and chosen individuals: when the revelations of Allah are recited to them, they respond with profound reverence, falling down in prostration and weeping. This highlights their deep connection with Allah and their sensitivity to His word, setting the stage for a contrast with those who came after.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّةِ آدَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْرَائِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَا ۚ إِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُ الرَّحْمَٰنِ خَرُّوا سُجَّدًا وَبُكِيًّا ۩"},{"verse":"59","text":"But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,-","commentary":"In stark contrast to the devoted individuals described in the previous verse, this verse speaks about later generations who deviated from the path of their righteous predecessors. It notes two key failures: they neglected their prayers, which is a fundamental link with Allah, and they followed their own desires instead of divine guidance. The verse warns that those who follow this path will ultimately face ruin or destruction, emphasizing the serious consequences of abandoning one's commitment to Allah and pursuing worldly desires unchecked.","arabic":"فَخَلَفَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَاتَّبَعُوا الشَّهَوَاتِ ۖ فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا"},{"verse":"60","text":"Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,-","commentary":"Offering a path to salvation despite the warning in the previous verse, this verse makes an exception for those who change their ways. It states that those who sincerely repent (turn back to Allah), truly believe in Him, and do righteous deeds will escape the fate of ruin. Instead, they are promised entry into Paradise, where they will be treated with complete fairness and will not suffer any injustice. This verse underscores Allah's mercy and the opportunity for anyone to change their path and earn divine favor by correcting their beliefs and actions.","arabic":"إِلَّا مَنْ تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَأُولَٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ شَيْئًا"},{"verse":"61","text":"Gardens of Eternity, those which (Allah) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass.","commentary":"Following a discussion about who will enter the Garden (Paradise), this verse describes it further. It is called the \"Gardens of Eternity,\" a place of everlasting residence. It is something that Allah, the Most Gracious, has promised to those who truly serve Him. This promised Garden is currently in the \"Unseen\" – meaning it is not visible to us now in this worldly life. However, Muslims believe in it because Allah has promised it, and His promise is certain to happen. This verse reassures believers that the reward for righteousness, though unseen at present, is guaranteed by Allah Himself.","arabic":"جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ عِبَادَهُ بِالْغَيْبِ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيًّا"},{"verse":"62","text":"They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening.","commentary":"Continuing the description of the Gardens of Eternity mentioned in the previous verse, this verse gives us a glimpse into the experience of those who reside there. It highlights the peaceful and pleasant atmosphere. In the Gardens, people will not hear any empty or useless talk, or any unpleasant noise or arguments. Instead, they will only hear expressions of peace. This indicates a state of complete tranquility and harmony. Furthermore, the verse mentions that their needs will be met effortlessly, as their sustenance will be provided regularly, morning and evening, without any hardship, worry, or anxiety.","arabic":"لَا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا إِلَّا سَلَامًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا"},{"verse":"63","text":"Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil.","commentary":"This verse connects the description of the Gardens of Eternity back to the people who will enter it. It is a place that Allah grants as an inheritance to His servants who \"guard against evil.\" This refers to those who are mindful of Allah, strive to avoid sin, and live righteously. The term \"inheritance\" suggests that this Garden is not merely a temporary reward but a permanent abode that they receive as a result of their life of faith and good conduct. It reinforces the idea from earlier verses that descent or ancestry are not what grant entry; rather, it is a life of sincere belief and righteous action, which is described here as guarding against evil.","arabic":"تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِي نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَنْ كَانَ تَقِيًّا"},{"verse":"64","text":"(The angels say:) \"We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,-","commentary":"This verse shifts focus slightly, presented as a statement by the angels. It emphasizes that the angels act solely by the command of Allah. They highlight Allah's absolute control and knowledge over everything that exists – all that is in front of them, all that is hidden or in the past, and all that is in the present. The verse concludes by stating that Allah never forgets anything. In Islamic belief, affirming attributes of Allah like His perfect knowledge and that He does not forget is done as they are mentioned in the Qur'an, without likening Him to His creation or questioning the nature of these attributes. These attributes demonstrate His complete awareness and control over all matters, reinforcing His supreme authority described further in the next verse.","arabic":"وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلَّا بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ ۖ لَهُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا وَمَا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيًّا"},{"verse":"65","text":"\"Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?\"","commentary":"This verse expands on the theme of Allah's absolute authority introduced in the previous verse. It declares that Allah is the sole Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything in between. Because He is the Creator and Sustainer of all existence, the verse commands us to worship Him alone. It also instructs us to be constant and patient in our worship, acknowledging that devotion and living according to Allah's will require perseverance and steadfastness. The verse concludes with a powerful rhetorical question: \"Knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?\" This question highlights Allah's absolute uniqueness and supremacy, emphasizing that no one is equal to Him or shares in His divine qualities or deserves worship alongside Him. This affirms that He alone is the one true object of worship.","arabic":"رَبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَاعْبُدْهُ وَاصْطَبِرْ لِعِبَادَتِهِ ۚ هَلْ تَعْلَمُ لَهُ سَمِيًّا"},{"verse":"66","text":"Man says: \"What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?\"","commentary":"This verse begins by capturing a common reaction among people when they hear about life after death and resurrection. It notes the surprise and disbelief some individuals express at the idea of being brought back to life after they have died and become dust. This question reflects a human tendency to find the concept difficult to grasp based on everyday experience.","arabic":"وَيَقُولُ الْإِنْسَانُ أَإِذَا مَا مِتُّ لَسَوْفَ أُخْرَجُ حَيًّا"},{"verse":"67","text":"But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?","commentary":"Following the question in the previous verse (66), this verse offers a powerful reminder and a simple answer. It asks whether a person who questions resurrection has forgotten their own origin. Allah created humanity in the first place from nothingness. If Allah could bring a person into existence initially when they were not, bringing them back to life after death should not be seen as impossible. This highlights the connection between our initial creation and the potential for resurrection.","arabic":"أَوَلَا يَذْكُرُ الْإِنْسَانُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَلَمْ يَكُ شَيْئًا"},{"verse":"68","text":"So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell;","commentary":"Addressing the disbelief about resurrection mentioned in the preceding verses (66-67), this verse offers a solemn affirmation from Allah, emphasized by an oath. It states with certainty that all people will be gathered together on a future Day. It also mentions that those who denied the truth will be gathered along with \"the Evil Ones,\" suggesting their close association and influence. A vivid scene is then presented where these groups are brought in a state of humility and distress, kneeling around the vicinity of Hell.","arabic":"فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحْشُرَنَّهُمْ وَالشَّيَاطِينَ ثُمَّ لَنُحْضِرَنَّهُمْ حَوْلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيًّا"},{"verse":"69","text":"Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (Allah) Most Gracious.","commentary":"Building on the scene of gathering around Hell described in the previous verse (68), this verse focuses on those most deserving of punishment. From the gathered crowds and different groups, those who were most stubborn and rebellious in their defiance of Allah will be singled out and brought forth. This signifies a process of selection based on the severity of their opposition to divine guidance, highlighting the consequence of persistent wrongdoing.","arabic":"ثُمَّ لَنَنْزِعَنَّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَٰنِ عِتِيًّا"},{"verse":"70","text":"And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein.","commentary":"This verse directly follows the description of selecting the most rebellious for punishment (verse 69). It emphasizes Allah's absolute knowledge and justice. It assures that the process is not arbitrary; Allah knows precisely who is most deserving of the intense punishment of Hellfire. This reinforces the concept of accountability and that individuals will face the consequences appropriate to their actions and attitude towards divine truth, known fully by Allah.","arabic":"ثُمَّ لَنَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِالَّذِينَ هُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِهَا صِلِيًّا"},{"verse":"71","text":"Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished.","commentary":"Transitioning from the specific focus on the most rebellious, this verse presents a broader statement about the fate everyone will face. It states that everyone will pass by or near Hell. The nature and meaning of this \"passing\" are subject to interpretation, but the verse asserts it is a definite and unavoidable decree from Allah that must occur. This sets the stage for the different outcomes for people depending on their faith and deeds, explained in the following verse.","arabic":"وَإِنْ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا ۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَقْضِيًّا"},{"verse":"72","text":"But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees.","commentary":"This verse provides the crucial distinction in the experience described in the previous verse (71), explaining the different destinies after passing near Hell. It clearly states that Allah will save those who were mindful of Him and sought to protect themselves from sin and its consequences (often referred to as \"God-fearing\" or \"righteous\"). In contrast, the wrongdoers will be left behind in Hell, in a state of humiliation and submission. This verse underscores the ultimate separation between the righteous and the unrighteous based on their conduct in this life.","arabic":"ثُمَّ نُنَجِّي الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا وَنَذَرُ الظَّالِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيًّا"},{"verse":"73","text":"When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, \"Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council?\"","commentary":"Shifting from the scenes of the afterlife (verses 68-72) back to this world, this verse describes a common attitude among those who reject divine guidance when confronted with its clear messages. It highlights how they often judge the truth based on worldly status, wealth, and social influence. They compare themselves and their followers, who may possess worldly advantages, with the believers, who might appear humble or lacking in material power, and boast about their own perceived superiority in position and appearance. This sets up a contrast between worldly values and divine truth.","arabic":"وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ خَيْرٌ مَقَامًا وَأَحْسَنُ نَدِيًّا"},{"verse":"74","text":"But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye?","commentary":"Responding to the worldly boasting of the unbelievers mentioned in the previous verse (73), this verse offers a historical perspective and a warning. It reminds them that many previous generations were destroyed by Allah, even though they surpassed the current disbelievers in material strength, resources, and outward splendor. The fate of these powerful but defiant peoples serves as evidence that worldly advantage does not guarantee protection from Allah's judgment, challenging the basis of their pride.","arabic":"وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِنْ قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَحْسَنُ أَثَاثًا وَرِئْيًا"},{"verse":"75","text":"Say: \"If any men go astray, (Allah) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of Allah (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces!","commentary":"Following the reminder of past destructions (verse 74), this verse instructs the Prophet to state that Allah, in His immense grace, gives those who choose to go astray a period of time. This period allows them to continue in their ways until the point when the warning they were given is fulfilled. This fulfillment could come in the form of a worldly punishment or the arrival of the Day of Judgment itself. At that critical moment, they will fully realize who was truly in a worse position and who possessed less strength, revealing the ultimate emptiness of their worldly pride.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ كَانَ فِي الضَّلَالَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ مَدًّا ۚ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَأَوْا مَا يُوعَدُونَ إِمَّا الْعَذَابَ وَإِمَّا السَّاعَةَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ شَرٌّ مَكَانًا وَأَضْعَفُ جُنْدًا"},{"verse":"76","text":"\"And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return.\"","commentary":"Picking up on the discussion from the previous verses about worldly boasting, this verse clarifies Allah's way of guiding people. It explains that Allah increases guidance for those who actively seek it. The verse then highlights that what truly lasts and holds value are good deeds. These deeds, unlike temporary worldly possessions or status, are the most rewarding and yield the best outcome in the sight of Allah, offering a far superior return than anything people find pleasure in this life.","arabic":"وَيَزِيدُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْا هُدًى ۗ وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ مَرَدًّا"},{"verse":"77","text":"Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children?\"","commentary":"This verse introduces a different aspect of disbelief, focusing on a person who rejects the signs revealed by Allah but confidently boasts that they will be given wealth and children. This attitude, mentioned in the commentary as reflecting a historical interaction with Prophet Muhammad, shows the mindset of some who mocked the idea of resurrection and relied solely on their perceived worldly status and future prospects.","arabic":"أَفَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالَ لَأُوتَيَنَّ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا"},{"verse":"78","text":"Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with (Allah) Most Gracious?","commentary":"Following the boast in the previous verse, this verse poses rhetorical questions challenging the basis of the person's confidence. It asks whether this individual has somehow gained knowledge of the future (the unseen realm, which is beyond human perception) or if they have secured a special promise or covenant directly from Allah, the Most Gracious. These questions underscore the emptiness of their claim and the lack of any real foundation for their boast about the future.","arabic":"أَطَّلَعَ الْغَيْبَ أَمِ اتَّخَذَ عِنْدَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا"},{"verse":"79","text":"Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall add and add to his punishment.","commentary":"Responding directly to the person's boast and the questions raised in the previous verses, this verse provides a stern answer. It begins with a strong negation, indicating that the person's claims in Verse 78 are false – they have no special knowledge or covenant. Instead, Allah states that He will meticulously record everything this person says. Furthermore, their suffering and punishment will be significantly increased and prolonged, serving as a powerful warning against such arrogant denial and ridicule.","arabic":"كَلَّا ۚ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا يَقُولُ وَنَمُدُّ لَهُ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ مَدًّا"},{"verse":"80","text":"To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone.","commentary":"Continuing the warning from the previous verse, this verse adds another dimension to the consequences of this person's attitude. It states that everything they boast about – their wealth and children mentioned in Verse 77 – will ultimately be taken away. On the Day of Judgment, this person will stand before Allah stripped of all such worldly possessions and support, completely alone and powerless, emphasizing the ultimate futility of their worldly pride and denial.","arabic":"وَنَرِثُهُ مَا يَقُولُ وَيَأْتِينَا فَرْدًا"},{"verse":"81","text":"And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory!","commentary":"Shifting focus from the specific case discussed in the preceding verses, this verse addresses another practice of those who reject Allah's truth. It describes how some people turn to worship entities other than Allah, such as angels or jinn (as mentioned in the commentary), with the hope that these false deities will grant them power, victory, or status. This highlights the motivation behind worshipping others alongside or instead of Allah – seeking worldly advantage rather than true guidance.","arabic":"وَاتَّخَذُوا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ آلِهَةً لِيَكُونُوا لَهُمْ عِزًّا"},{"verse":"82","text":"Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them.","commentary":"This verse reveals the outcome of worshipping false deities mentioned in Verse 81. It states that on the Day of Judgment, those very beings that were worshipped will renounce and reject the worship directed towards them. Far from granting power or glory, these 'gods' will turn against their former worshippers and become their adversaries, testifying against them. This illustrates the ultimate failure and betrayal inherent in relying on anything other than Allah.","arabic":"كَلَّا ۚ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا"},{"verse":"83","text":"Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury?","commentary":"This verse explains another factor contributing to the behavior of those who deny the truth. It points out that Allah allows certain evil influences (referred to as \"Evil Ones\" or satanic forces) to be active among those who disbelieve. These forces constantly provoke and incite them towards wrongdoing, denial, and hostility towards faith. This is part of the trial in this life, where individuals are tested by various influences.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا الشَّيَاطِينَ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزًّا"},{"verse":"84","text":"So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days).","commentary":"Addressing Prophet Muhammad (and implicitly, the believers), this verse offers guidance regarding the unbelievers described previously. It advises not to be impatient or distressed by their actions or apparent success in this life. It reminds that their time is limited and that Allah is meticulously counting their days and their actions. This highlights that their period of opposition and freedom is finite and subject to Allah's precise reckoning, which will be revealed in due time.","arabic":"فَلَا تَعْجَلْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ إِنَّمَا نَعُدُّ لَهُمْ عَدًّا"},{"verse":"85","text":"The day We shall gather the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours,","commentary":"Following the mention of the limited time for the deniers in the previous verse, this verse paints a contrasting picture of the Day of Judgment, focusing on the destiny of the righteous. It describes how, on that day, those who were mindful of Allah and did good deeds will be gathered before Allah, the Most Gracious. The verse uses an image of honored guests being presented before a king to convey the respect, dignity, and favorable reception awaiting them from Allah. This provides a hopeful contrast to the fate of the unbelievers discussed earlier.","arabic":"يَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ الْمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى الرَّحْمَٰنِ وَفْدًا"},{"verse":"86","text":"And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,-","commentary":"This verse describes a scene on the Day of Judgment. It speaks of those who have lived lives of persistent disobedience and wrongdoing, stating that Allah will gather them and bring them towards Hell. The image used emphasizes their state as being brought forward without the ability to resist, facing a severe consequence for their actions in this life. This verse sets the scene for the lack of support and aid available to them, as explained in the following verse.","arabic":"وَنَسُوقُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وِرْدًا"},{"verse":"87","text":"None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most Gracious.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, which described the state of those brought towards Hell, this verse clarifies that on that Day, no one will be able to intervene or plead on their behalf. The power of intercession belongs solely to Allah. Any intercession that occurs will only be by His express permission or for someone regarding whom He has made a promise – which the commentary links to good deeds performed in this life. This highlights Allah's absolute authority on the Day of Judgment and emphasizes that accountability is ultimately before Him alone.","arabic":"لَا يَمْلِكُونَ الشَّفَاعَةَ إِلَّا مَنِ اتَّخَذَ عِنْدَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا"},{"verse":"88","text":"They say: \"(Allah) Most Gracious has begotten a son!\"","commentary":"This verse introduces a significant theme in Islamic belief: the absolute uniqueness and oneness of Allah. It refers to those who make claims about Allah having offspring. In Islam, this claim, made by various groups throughout history concerning different figures, is considered a grave falsehood. The commentary emphasizes that this statement is viewed as highly offensive and contrary to the true nature of Allah. The verses that follow further elaborate on the severity of this claim and its impact.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا"},{"verse":"89","text":"Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous!","commentary":"Following the claim mentioned in the previous verse about Allah having a son, this verse immediately responds by stating that this assertion is something truly enormous and monstrous. The commentary highlights the strong language used here to convey the gravity of this claim in the sight of Allah. It is not seen as a minor error but as a fundamental deviation from the understanding of Allah's perfection and uniqueness. The next verses vividly describe the shock this claim causes.","arabic":"لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا"},{"verse":"90","text":"At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin,","commentary":"This verse uses powerful imagery to illustrate the immense shock and abhorrence that the claim of Allah having a son causes throughout the universe. The commentary explains that the heavens, the earth, and the mountains are depicted as being on the verge of shattering or collapsing in response to this falsehood. This reflects the Islamic belief that the entire creation naturally recognizes and submits to Allah's oneness, and thus recoils from such a claim as profoundly unnatural and offensive.","arabic":"تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنْشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا"},{"verse":"91","text":"That they should invoke a son for (Allah) Most Gracious.","commentary":"This verse reiterates the specific claim being condemned: people attributing a son to Allah, the Most Merciful. The commentary explains that this repetition emphasizes the monstrous nature of the act itself, particularly in the context of Allah's attribute of mercy. It is seen as deeply incompatible with His majesty and perfection to suggest He would have offspring in the way humans understand it.","arabic":"أَنْ دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا"},{"verse":"92","text":"For it is not consonant with the majesty of (Allah) Most Gracious that He should beget a son.","commentary":"This verse provides the direct reason why the claim of Allah having a son is so offensive: it is fundamentally inconsistent with Allah's majesty and nature. The commentary explains that in Islamic belief, Allah is transcendent, complete, and unlike anything in creation. Having a son would imply a need, a likeness to created beings, or a partnership, all of which contradict His absolute oneness and perfection. This verse serves as a definitive statement clarifying the Islamic position on this matter.","arabic":"وَمَا يَنْبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَنْ يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا"},{"verse":"93","text":"Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (Allah) Most Gracious as a servant.","commentary":"This verse shifts from refuting the claim of Allah having a son to stating a fundamental truth about all existence. It declares that every single being in the heavens and on earth is a servant of Allah. The commentary explains that this is a core principle: all creation is subject to Allah's will and is His creation. This contrasts with the idea of someone being a \"son\" in a familial or divine partnership sense, reinforcing that the relationship between Allah and everything else is that of Creator and servant. This sets the stage for the accountability mentioned in the following verses.","arabic":"إِنْ كُلُّ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا"},{"verse":"94","text":"He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly.","commentary":"Following the statement that all beings are servants of Allah (in the previous verse), this verse emphasizes Allah's absolute knowledge and control over all His creation. The commentary explains that Allah has full awareness of every single being, knows their numbers precisely, and keeps a meticulous record of their actions. This highlights His complete knowledge and the certainty of accountability, assuring that nothing is hidden from Him and everyone's deeds are recorded for judgment. This connects to the idea of coming before Him, mentioned next.","arabic":"لَقَدْ أَحْصَاهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدًّا"},{"verse":"95","text":"And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment.","commentary":"Concluding this section, this verse describes the state of individuals when they are brought before Allah for judgment. The commentary emphasizes that each person will appear alone. Despite any relationships, wealth, status, or support they may have had in this world, on that Day, none of that will accompany them or be of help. They will be judged individually based on their own deeds. This underscores the personal nature of accountability before Allah and serves as a solemn reminder for everyone.","arabic":"وَكُلُّهُمْ آتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَرْدًا"},{"verse":"96","text":"On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (Allah) Most Gracious bestow love.","commentary":"This verse speaks about the special favor Allah grants to those who sincerely believe and live lives reflecting that belief through righteous actions. In contrast to the loneliness and isolation some will experience, believers are promised a comforting and loving connection with Allah. This love is understood within the Islamic tradition as a profound favor from Allah, which is even said to be extended to the angels in the heavens and to bring acceptance on Earth.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وُدًّا"},{"verse":"97","text":"So have We made the (Qur'an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention.","commentary":"Following the mention of Allah's love for the believers, this verse highlights how this message, encompassing both good news for those who are mindful of Allah and warnings for those who persistently argue against the truth, is conveyed. It explains that Allah has made the Qur'an easy to understand by revealing it in the clear language of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which was Arabic. This was done so that the Prophet could deliver these glad tidings and warnings effectively to all people.","arabic":"فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَاهُ بِلِسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْمًا لُدًّا"},{"verse":"98","text":"But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed? Canst thou find a single one of them (now) or hear (so much as) a whisper of them?","commentary":"This verse concludes the passage with a powerful reminder about the fate of past generations who ignored or rejected Allah's messages. It connects to the warnings mentioned in the previous verse (97) by offering a stark historical example. It prompts us to consider how many powerful communities existed before us, yet they were ultimately brought to an end. The verse asks a rhetorical question, emphasizing their complete disappearance – not one individual remains, not even a faint sound can be heard from them. This serves as a poignant reflection on the temporary nature of worldly existence and power compared to the eternal reality that Allah alone endures.","arabic":"وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِنْ قَرْنٍ هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزًا"}];
