    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad.","commentary":"This verse contains a sequence of letters from the Arabic alphabet. The meaning and purpose of these initial letters, found at the beginning of some chapters of the Qur'an, are known only to Allah. Some Muslim scholars suggest they may point to the fact that the Qur'an is composed of these very Arabic letters, yet it is miraculously beyond human ability to create anything like it, demonstrating its divine origin.","arabic":"المص"},{"verse":"2","text":"A Book revealed unto thee,- So let thy heart be oppressed no more by any difficulty on that account,- that with it thou mightest warn (the erring) and teach the Believers).","commentary":"Following the initial letters that introduce this chapter, this verse immediately affirms that the Qur'an is a divine revelation sent down to Prophet Muhammad. It addresses the Prophet, reassuring him that he should not feel burdened or distressed by the immense task of conveying this message, especially considering the resistance and challenges he might face. The purpose of this book is then explicitly stated: to warn those who are going astray and to remind and instruct the believers, guiding them towards the right path.","arabic":"كِتَابٌ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلَا يَكُنْ فِي صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِنْهُ لِتُنْذِرَ بِهِ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends or protectors, other than Him. Little it is ye remember of admonition.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse which introduced the Qur'an as a divine revelation, this verse addresses all people, commanding them to follow the guidance that has been sent down to them from Allah, their Sustainer. It sternly warns against seeking guidance, protection, or authority from anyone or anything other than Allah. The verse concludes by noting how seldom people truly take heed of such important reminders, emphasizing the human tendency to forget or ignore divine admonition.","arabic":"اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَا تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"How many towns have We destroyed (for their sins)? Our punishment took them on a sudden by night or while they slept for their afternoon rest.","commentary":"To underscore the seriousness of rejecting divine guidance mentioned in the previous verse, this verse presents a historical lesson. It highlights how many communities in the past were destroyed due to their wrongdoing and refusal to follow Allah's messages. The verse specifically mentions that divine punishment often came upon them suddenly, either during the security of night or during their daytime rest, serving as a potent warning against complacency and ignoring the consequences of one's actions.","arabic":"وَكَمْ مِنْ قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَا فَجَاءَهَا بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتًا أَوْ هُمْ قَائِلُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: \"Indeed we did wrong.\"","commentary":"This verse describes the reaction of the destroyed communities at the moment divine punishment descended upon them. Faced with the inevitable consequence of their choices, their only acknowledgment was a confession: \"Indeed we did wrong.\" This demonstrates the realization, albeit too late, of their error – which, in the context of the Qur'an, often refers to rejecting faith, associating partners with Allah, and deviating from the righteous path. This confession highlights the ultimate truth of their situation but occurs at a time when repentance is no longer possible.","arabic":"فَمَا كَانَ دَعْوَاهُمْ إِذْ جَاءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا إِلَّا أَنْ قَالُوا إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Then shall we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom We sent it.","commentary":"Transitioning from the worldly consequences discussed in the previous verses, this verse moves the scene forward to the Day of Judgment. It declares that on that Day, Allah will question everyone: both the people who received the divine messages and the messengers, like Prophet Muhammad, who delivered them. This emphasizes universal accountability, showing that both the recipients of guidance and those entrusted with conveying it will be called to account for their actions and responses. This verse connects the historical consequences seen in this life to the ultimate reckoning in the Hereafter.","arabic":"فَلَنَسْأَلَنَّ الَّذِينَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَنَسْأَلَنَّ الْمُرْسَلِينَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"And verily, We shall recount their whole story with knowledge, for We were never absent (at any time or place).","commentary":"Following the declaration of questioning in the previous verse, this verse emphasizes Allah's perfect knowledge and complete awareness of everything that happened. It states that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will lay bare the entire story of each individual, recounting their deeds and intentions with absolute knowledge. This serves as a reminder that nothing is hidden from Allah; He was present and aware of all actions, conversations, and thoughts throughout their lives.","arabic":"فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ بِعِلْمٍ ۖ وَمَا كُنَّا غَائِبِينَ"},{"verse":"8","text":"The balance that day will be true (to nicety): those whose scale (of good) will be heavy, will prosper:","commentary":"Continuing the scene of the Day of Judgment, this verse introduces the concept of the weighing of deeds. It affirms that the balance used on that Day will be perfectly true and accurate, ensuring absolute justice. It then states that those whose scale, representing the weight of their good deeds, is heavy will be successful. This highlights that success in the Hereafter is determined by the accumulation of righteous actions and adherence to Allah's guidance.","arabic":"وَالْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ ۚ فَمَنْ ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"Those whose scale will be light, will be their souls in perdition, for that they wrongfully treated Our signs.","commentary":"This verse presents the contrasting outcome for those whose scale of deeds is light. It describes their fate as losing their own souls, facing perdition, which is a consequence of their actions in life. The reason given is that they \"wrongfully treated Our signs.\" This phrase indicates their injustice towards Allah's revelations and messages, which often includes rejecting them, distorting their meaning, or failing to live by them. From an Islamic perspective, rejecting divine guidance is seen as the ultimate injustice because it denies the truth from the Creator. This verse stands in contrast to the previous one, completing the description of the two possible outcomes based on the weighing of deeds.","arabic":"وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth, and provided you therein with means for the fulfilment of your life: small are the thanks that ye give!","commentary":"This verse begins by explaining a fundamental truth about human existence on Earth: Allah is the One who has given humanity a place of settlement and authority on this planet. He has provided all the resources and means necessary for life to flourish and for people to sustain themselves. The verse points out that despite these immense blessings and provisions, humanity often shows little gratitude. This sets a theme that will be explored further, hinting at a challenge to human behavior.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَّاكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَعَايِشَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَا تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis; He refused to be of those who prostrate.","commentary":"Continuing from the idea of humanity's place and provisions on Earth, this verse goes back to the very beginning of human creation, specifically the creation of Prophet Adam. It states that Allah created and formed humanity (represented by Adam). As a sign of honor for this new creation, Allah commanded the angels to prostrate, an act of deep reverence or worship commanded by Allah. The angels all obeyed this command. However, one being present, Iblis, refused to prostrate. This refusal introduces a key antagonist in the human story, setting the stage for the conflict that follows.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنَ السَّاجِدِينَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"(Allah) said: \"What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee?\" He said: \"I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay.\"","commentary":"Following Iblis's refusal mentioned in the previous verse, Allah directly questions him, asking for the reason behind his disobedience. Iblis responds with a justification based on his perception of his own nature compared to Prophet Adam's. He claims superiority because he was created from fire, while Adam was created from clay. This shows that Iblis's refusal was not due to a lack of knowledge of Allah's command or authority, but stemmed from arrogance and a belief in his own supposed nobility based on his origin. This pride is presented as the root of his defiance.","arabic":"قَالَ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَلَّا تَسْجُدَ إِذْ أَمَرْتُكَ ۖ قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِنْ نَارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِنْ طِينٍ"},{"verse":"13","text":"(Allah) said: \"Get thee down from this: it is not for thee to be arrogant here: get out, for thou art of the meanest (of creatures).\"","commentary":"In response to Iblis's arrogant justification for disobeying a direct command, Allah declares that arrogance is not permissible in this presence. Iblis is commanded to descend (implying expulsion from a place of honor or proximity to Allah) and is told to leave, characterized as being among the most humiliated. This marks the immediate consequence of Iblis's pride and disobedience, establishing his fall from grace and reinforcing the principle that arrogance has no place before divine authority. This expulsion is a direct result of his refusal to honor Adam as Allah commanded.","arabic":"قَالَ فَاهْبِطْ مِنْهَا فَمَا يَكُونُ لَكَ أَنْ تَتَكَبَّرَ فِيهَا فَاخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الصَّاغِرِينَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"He said: \"Give me respite till the day they are raised up.\"","commentary":"Having been expelled and humbled for his disobedience (as described in the previous verses), Iblis makes a request to Allah. He asks for a delay or postponement of his final consequence, specifically until the Day of Resurrection when all beings will be raised from the dead. This request, coming immediately after his expulsion, shows his continued defiance and perhaps a desire for opportunity rather than repentance.","arabic":"قَالَ أَنْظِرْنِي إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"(Allah) said: \"Be thou among those who have respite.\"","commentary":"Responding to Iblis's request from the previous verse, Allah grants him the respite he asked for. He is told he will indeed be among those given a delay until a specified time (often understood from other verses as a specific day, though related to the final judgment). This divine allowance for Iblis to exist for a prolonged period sets the stage for his further actions, which are revealed in the following verses.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الْمُنْظَرِينَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"He said: \"Because thou hast thrown me out of the way, lo! I will lie in wait for them on thy straight way:","commentary":"Following Allah's granting of respite (mentioned in the previous verse), Iblis declares his malicious intent. Blaming Allah for his expulsion (\"Because You have thrown me out of the way\"), Iblis vows to target humanity. He states he will lie in ambush specifically on Allah's \"straight way\" – the path of truth, guidance, and obedience that leads to Allah. This reveals his plan to actively work against humanity's spiritual journey towards Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِي لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَاطَكَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"\"Then will I assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: Nor wilt thou find, in most of them, gratitude (for thy mercies).\"","commentary":"Expanding on his vow in the previous verse to lie in wait, Iblis details his strategy for misguiding humanity. He declares he will attack them from all directions – from the front, behind, right, and left. This implies a comprehensive and relentless effort to tempt and mislead people, using every possible angle and weakness. He then makes a bold prediction or observation about the outcome of his efforts, stating that Allah will find most of humanity ungrateful. This connects back to the theme of gratitude introduced in Verse 10 and highlights the challenge humanity faces against Iblis's relentless attacks, which aim to turn people away from appreciating Allah's blessings.","arabic":"ثُمَّ لَآتِيَنَّهُمْ مِنْ بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَعَنْ شَمَائِلِهِمْ ۖ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"(Allah) said: \"Get out from this, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow thee,- Hell will I fill with you all.","commentary":"This verse concludes the direct interaction between Allah and Iblis in this scene. Repeating the command for him to leave (first given in Verse 13), Allah emphasizes his state of disgrace and expulsion. A stern warning is then given: if any human beings choose to follow Iblis in his path of disobedience and misguidance, they will share his fate. Allah declares that Hell will be filled with Iblis and all those who follow him. This clearly outlines the consequence for choosing the path of Satan and serves as a severe warning to humanity introduced in the preceding verses.","arabic":"قَالَ اخْرُجْ مِنْهَا مَذْءُومًا مَدْحُورًا ۖ لَمَنْ تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنْكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"\"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and enjoy (its good things) as ye wish: but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"","commentary":"Following the scene of Iblis's expulsion and vow of enmity towards humanity (verses 11-18), the narrative shifts focus to Prophet Adam and his wife. This verse directly addresses them, granting them permission to dwell in a Garden (often understood as Paradise) and freely enjoy its provisions. However, it introduces a single prohibition: they are commanded not to approach a specific tree. The consequence of disobeying this command is clearly stated: they would become wrongdoers or bring harm upon themselves. This establishes the first test for humanity and directly leads into the events that follow, where Iblis attempts to tempt Adam and his wife using this very prohibition. This command highlights Allah's guidance and the beginning of accountability for human actions.","arabic":"وَيَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ فَكُلَا مِنْ حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: \"Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever.\"","commentary":"Following the command from Allah, Adam and his wife were living in the Garden, free to enjoy everything except for one specific tree. Here, we see how Satan, who was previously expelled from Allah's presence due to his arrogance towards Adam, began to tempt them. His goal was to expose their vulnerability and cause them to disobey Allah. He approached them with deceptive whispers, claiming that Allah had only forbidden them from eating from that tree to prevent them from becoming angels or living forever like immortal beings. This appeal played on potential desires for power or immortality, twisting Allah's command to make it seem restrictive rather than protective.","arabic":"فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ لِيُبْدِيَ لَهُمَا مَا وُورِيَ عَنْهُمَا مِنْ سَوْآتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَاكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ الْخَالِدِينَ"},{"verse":"21","text":"And he swore to them both, that he was their sincere adviser.","commentary":"Continuing his deceptive strategy, Satan reinforced his false claims by swearing to Adam and his wife that his advice was sincere and that he was genuinely looking out for their best interests. This was a critical step in his plan, as it aimed to overcome any reservations they might have had about disobeying Allah or trusting him, their known enemy. By adding an oath, Satan made his temptation seem more trustworthy, despite his true nature and intentions. This verse shows the extent of Satan's cunning in trying to lead people astray. This act of swearing was intended to reassure them and make them forget Allah's warning about Satan being their clear enemy, as mentioned in the previous context.","arabic":"وَقَاسَمَهُمَا إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: \"Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you?\"","commentary":"As a result of Satan's persistent temptation and their yielding to his deceitful promises and oath, Adam and his wife ate from the forbidden tree. The immediate consequence was that parts of their bodies that had previously been concealed from their own perception became visible to them, causing them a sense of shame or nakedness. In response, they instinctively tried to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. At this point, Allah called out to them, reminding them of His explicit prohibition regarding the tree and His warning that Satan was their clear and declared enemy. This call served as both a gentle reproach for their disobedience and a reminder of the wisdom behind the prohibition and the true nature of Satan. This moment highlights human vulnerability to temptation but also the inherent sense of modesty that arose immediately upon transgression.","arabic":"فَدَلَّاهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ ۚ فَلَمَّا ذَاقَا الشَّجَرَةَ بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْآتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِنْ وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ وَنَادَاهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَنْ تِلْكُمَا الشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُلْ لَكُمَا إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمَا عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"23","text":"They said: \"Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls: If thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy Mercy, we shall certainly be lost.\"","commentary":"Unlike Satan, who responded to Allah's command with arrogance and defiance, Adam and his wife immediately recognized their mistake and turned back to Allah. They sincerely admitted that they had wronged themselves by disobeying Him and pleaded for His forgiveness and mercy. They understood that without Allah's pardon and grace, they would be utterly lost. This response reveals a key characteristic of human nature in the Islamic perspective: the capacity for repentance, acknowledging wrongdoing, and seeking Allah's mercy when realizing a mistake. This plea follows directly from Allah's address in the previous verse, showing their immediate remorse and turning back to their Creator.","arabic":"قَالَا رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَا أَنْفُسَنَا وَإِنْ لَمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"(Allah) said: \"Get ye down. With enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood,- for a time.\"","commentary":"Following their repentance, Allah decreed that Adam, his wife, and Satan (along with his forces) would descend from the Garden to Earth. This descent marked the beginning of human life on Earth as we know it. Allah stated that they would live on Earth with enmity between them – referring to the ongoing conflict between humanity and Satan. Earth was designated as their temporary home and the place where they would find their sustenance and means of life for a specific period. This verse sets the stage for human existence on Earth, defining it as a place of trial involving the struggle against temptation, but also providing the means to live and thrive.","arabic":"قَالَ اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"25","text":"He said: \"Therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die; but from it shall ye be taken out (at last).\"","commentary":"Concluding the decree regarding their dwelling on Earth, Allah specified the cycle of life that awaited humanity. On Earth, they would live out their lives, and eventually, they would die. However, this earthly existence and death are not the final end. The verse adds that from Earth, they would ultimately be brought forth again, which refers to the resurrection on the Day of Judgment. This final part of the verse reminds humanity that life on Earth is a temporary stage, and there is an ultimate return to Allah for accountability and the final outcome. This builds upon the previous verse by completing the picture of earthly existence from beginning (descent) to end (resurrection).","arabic":"قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"O ye Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame, as well as to be an adornment to you. But the raiment of righteousness,- that is the best. Such are among the Signs of Allah, that they may receive admonition!","commentary":"Addressing all humanity, referred to as \"Children of Adam,\" Allah reminds us of His grace. He has provided us with clothing, which serves two purposes: to cover our private parts (a natural human inclination towards modesty, first seen with Adam and Eve covering themselves with leaves in the Garden after they ate from the forbidden tree) and to be an adornment, making us look good. The verse then points out that while physical clothing is important, there is a spiritual covering, the \"raiment of righteousness\" or God-consciousness, which is even better. This spiritual state of being aware of Allah and striving to do what is right is the most valuable form of clothing. These provisions and principles are signs from Allah, meant for us to reflect upon and learn from. This verse connects back to the story of Adam and Eve losing their covering after disobeying Allah, highlighting that physical and spiritual states are linked and come from Allah's provision and guidance.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"O ye Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, in the same manner as He got your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose their shame: for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them: We made the evil ones friends (only) to those without faith.","commentary":"This verse continues the address to humanity, issuing a direct warning. Just as Satan deceived our first parents, Adam and Eve, leading to their expulsion from the Garden and the exposure of their nakedness, he will try to deceive us too. The warning emphasizes that Satan and his followers are unseen enemies who constantly watch us, seeking opportunities to lead us astray. Allah states that He allows these evil forces to be companions and protectors only for those who choose not to believe in Him. This serves as a reminder of Satan's continuous efforts against humanity and highlights the danger of yielding to his temptations, especially those that lead away from modesty and obedience to Allah, echoing the consequence seen in the previous verse with Adam and Eve.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي آدَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ كَمَا أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُمْ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ يَنْزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا لِيُرِيَهُمَا سَوْآتِهِمَا ۗ إِنَّهُ يَرَاكُمْ هُوَ وَقَبِيلُهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا تَرَوْنَهُمْ ۗ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا الشَّيَاطِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"When they do aught that is shameful, they say: \"We found our fathers doing so\"; and \"Allah commanded us thus\": Say: \"Nay, Allah never commands what is shameful: do ye say of Allah what ye know not?\"","commentary":"This verse addresses people who commit shameful acts (like the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of performing religious rituals naked) and try to justify them by claiming they are simply following the traditions of their ancestors or, even worse, claiming that Allah Himself commanded them to do so. Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to tell them clearly that Allah never commands anything shameful or indecent. It challenges them for attributing something to Allah without having any certain knowledge or proof from divine revelation. This verse connects to the previous one by illustrating a specific way Satan seduces people: by making them follow misguided traditions and falsely claiming divine sanction for their improper actions. It highlights the importance of basing beliefs and practices on genuine knowledge from Allah, not blind imitation or false claims.","arabic":"وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَا آبَاءَنَا وَاللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"Say: \"My Lord hath commanded justice; and that ye set your whole selves (to Him) at every time and place of prayer, and call upon Him, making your devotion sincere as in His sight: such as He created you in the beginning, so shall ye return.\"","commentary":"Following the refutation of false claims about what Allah commands, this verse explicitly states what Allah truly has commanded. It emphasizes two core principles: justice in all matters, and sincere devotion to Allah alone. It instructs people to turn their entire being towards Allah at every time and place they engage in prayer or worship, calling upon Him with pure sincerity, dedicating their worship solely to Him. The verse concludes with a reminder that just as Allah created humanity in the beginning, they will ultimately return to Him. This connects to the previous verse by contrasting Allah's true commands (justice, sincere devotion) with the false claims of commanding shameful acts, reinforcing the path of righteousness as opposed to the path of misguidance influenced by Satan.","arabic":"قُلْ أَمَرَ رَبِّي بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ وَأَقِيمُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ عِنْدَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَادْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ ۚ كَمَا بَدَأَكُمْ تَعُودُونَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"Some He hath guided: Others have (by their choice) deserved the loss of their way; in that they took the evil ones, in preference to Allah, for their friends and protectors, and think that they receive guidance.","commentary":"Expanding on the idea of returning to Allah mentioned in the previous verse, this verse clarifies the two distinct outcomes based on people's choices. Some individuals are graced with Allah's guidance, accepting and following the path of truth and justice He has laid out. Others, however, choose a path that leads them astray; they essentially choose the \"evil ones\" (Satans) as their companions and protectors instead of relying on and submitting to Allah. A tragic aspect of this choice is that those who follow the evil ones often mistakenly believe that they are on the right path. This verse highlights the human capacity for choice and the consequences of choosing reliance on evil influences over seeking guidance and protection from Allah.","arabic":"فَرِيقًا هَدَىٰ وَفَرِيقًا حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الضَّلَالَةُ ۗ إِنَّهُمُ اتَّخَذُوا الشَّيَاطِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters.","commentary":"Returning to the theme of clothing and provisions, this verse is another address to humanity. It encourages believers to dress appropriately, in their best apparel, when they gather for prayer or worship. This contrasts sharply with the pre-Islamic practice of some Arabs who would perform religious rituals (like circling the Ka'bah) in the nude. The verse also gives permission to enjoy the good things Allah has provided – to eat and drink – but with a crucial condition: do not be wasteful or extravagant, as Allah does not love those who waste. This verse connects to the earlier discussion on clothing and Allah's provisions as signs of His grace, correcting the misguided practices that involved arbitrary prohibitions and indecency, and emphasizing moderation in enjoying lawful things.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي آدَمَ خُذُوا زِينَتَكُمْ عِنْدَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا وَلَا تُسْرِفُوا ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"Say: Who hath forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah, which He hath produced for His servants, and the things, clean and pure, (which He hath provided) for sustenance? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand.","commentary":"This verse directly challenges those who impose arbitrary prohibitions on beautiful clothing and wholesome food that Allah has provided for humanity. It is a rhetorical question demanding to know who has the authority to forbid what Allah has made lawful. The verse then clarifies that these good things are meant for believers to enjoy in this worldly life. Furthermore, it highlights that on the Day of Judgment, these blessings will be exclusively for the believers. This serves as a reassurance to believers that their enjoyment of lawful things is affirmed by Allah and as a warning to those who invent prohibitions in Allah's name. Allah explains these signs clearly for those who possess knowledge and understanding, connecting back to the condemnation in Verse 28 of speaking about Allah without knowledge.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ وَالطَّيِّبَاتِ مِنَ الرِّزْقِ ۚ قُلْ هِيَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا خَالِصَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"Say: the things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are: shameful deeds, whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason; assigning of partners to Allah, for which He hath given no authority; and saying things about Allah of which ye have no knowledge.","commentary":"In direct contrast to the arbitrary prohibitions challenged in the previous verse, this verse explicitly lists the things that Allah has *truly* forbidden. These include: any act that is shameful or indecent, whether done publicly or privately; all forms of sin and exceeding the bounds set by Allah; oppression or injustice towards others; associating any partner with Allah (claiming someone or something shares in His unique divinity or authority to legislate), especially without any divine proof; and speaking about Allah or attributing things to Him without certain knowledge. This verse provides a clear summary of major divine prohibitions, reinforcing the principle that only Allah has the authority to declare what is lawful and unlawful, connecting back to the condemnation in Verse 28 and refuting invented religious practices.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالْإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْيَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَنْ تُشْرِكُوا بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَانًا وَأَنْ تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation).","commentary":"Concluding this passage, the verse introduces a powerful reminder about the temporary nature of life and the certainty of accountability. It states that every community or generation, and by extension, every individual, has a specific, predetermined time limit or term on Earth. When this appointed time arrives, it cannot be delayed or hastened by even a single moment. This serves as a profound reminder of our limited time and encourages reflection and seriousness about obeying Allah's true commands, avoiding Satan's temptations, and refraining from inventing false religious practices or associating partners with Allah, as discussed in the preceding verses. It implicitly connects to the consequences mentioned in Verse 30, reminding people that their choices have an appointed time limit after which they will return to Allah for judgment.","arabic":"وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً ۖ وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"O ye Children of Adam! whenever there come to you messengers from amongst you, rehearsing My signs unto you,- those who are righteous and mend (their lives),- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.","commentary":"This verse addresses all humanity, the \"Children of Adam.\" It explains that throughout history, Allah sends messengers from among people to share His messages and guidance. The verse promises that those who listen to these messengers, are mindful of Allah (righteous), and improve themselves will live without fear or grief regarding their ultimate future and destiny. This connects to the previous discussion in the Sura about following divine guidance.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي آدَمَ إِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِنْكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِي ۙ فَمَنِ اتَّقَىٰ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance,- they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever).","commentary":"Following on from the previous verse, this verse presents the contrasting outcome. It states that those who reject Allah's messages and treat them with arrogance, meaning they dismiss or scorn them, are destined for the Fire and will reside there permanently. This highlights the importance of responding positively and humbly to the divine guidance brought by the messengers.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُوا عَنْهَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: \"Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah?\" They will reply, \"They have left us in the lurch,\" And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the severity of inventing falsehoods about Allah or rejecting His signs. It explains that such people have a decreed portion in this life, but when the angels of death arrive to take their souls, they will be asked about the false deities or concepts they relied upon instead of Allah. Their reply will be that those things have abandoned them. At this critical moment, they will effectively confess to having rejected Allah. This scene of death transitions into the description of their fate in the afterlife.","arabic":"فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُمْ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ قَالُوا أَيْنَ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ ۖ قَالُوا ضَلُّوا عَنَّا وَشَهِدُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا كَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"38","text":"He will say: \"Enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you - men and jinns, - into the Fire.\" Every time a new people enters, it curses its sister-people (that went before), until they follow each other, all into the Fire. Saith the last about the first: \"Our Lord! it is these that misled us: so give them a double penalty in the Fire.\" He will say: \"Doubled for all\": but this ye do not understand.","commentary":"Following the moment of death described in the previous verse, this verse portrays the scene of entering the Fire. Allah will command those who rejected Him to enter the Fire along with earlier generations of misguided people and unseen beings (jinn) who likewise disobeyed. As each group enters, they will curse the groups that came before them, blaming them for misleading them. The later generations will ask Allah for double punishment for those who went first, claiming they were led astray. Allah will reply that *all* will have double punishment, though they may not fully grasp the extent of it.","arabic":"قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِي أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ فِي النَّارِ ۖ كُلَّمَا دَخَلَتْ أُمَّةٌ لَعَنَتْ أُخْتَهَا ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ادَّارَكُوا فِيهَا جَمِيعًا قَالَتْ أُخْرَاهُمْ لِأُولَاهُمْ رَبَّنَا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَضَلُّونَا فَآتِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا مِنَ النَّارِ ۖ قَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"Then the first will say to the last: \"See then! No advantage have ye over us; so taste ye of the penalty for all that ye did!\"","commentary":"Continuing the scene in the Fire from the previous verse, this verse depicts the response of the earlier generations being cursed. They will retort to the later generations, stating that the later ones are no better than them and have gained no advantage. They will tell the later ones to taste the punishment for their own actions. This exchange shows the futile blaming and lack of solidarity among those who rejected Allah in this life.","arabic":"وَقَالَتْ أُولَاهُمْ لِأُخْرَاهُمْ فَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ فَضْلٍ فَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.","commentary":"This verse provides a strong statement about the impossibility of those who reject Allah's signs with arrogance entering Paradise (the Garden). It uses a vivid analogy: the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, and they will not enter Paradise unless a thick, twisted rope (or camel, as the Arabic word can mean both) can pass through the eye of a needle. This metaphor emphasizes that their entry is utterly impossible. This fate is presented as the consequence for their sinful actions.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُوا عَنْهَا لَا تُفَتَّحُ لَهُمْ أَبْوَابُ السَّمَاءِ وَلَا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ حَتَّىٰ يَلِجَ الْجَمَلُ فِي سَمِّ الْخِيَاطِ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"41","text":"For them there is Hell, as a couch (below) and folds and folds of covering above: such is Our requital of those who do wrong.","commentary":"This verse further describes the state of those in the Fire, elaborating on their dwelling place mentioned in previous verses (36, 38). It explains that Hell will be their resting place beneath them, and layers of fire will cover them from above. This powerful imagery conveys how completely they will be engulfed by the punishment. The verse concludes by stating that this is how Allah repays those who do wrong, linking this fate directly to their actions and rejection of guidance.","arabic":"لَهُمْ مِنْ جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"42","text":"But those who believe and work righteousness,- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear,- they will be Companions of the Garden, therein to dwell (for ever).","commentary":"In stark contrast to the fate of those who reject Allah's signs, this verse describes the destiny of believers who perform righteous deeds. It states that Allah does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. These individuals will be the companions of Paradise (the Garden) and will live there permanently. This verse introduces the opposite outcome, highlighting the mercy and ease Allah grants to those who follow His path, setting the scene for their blissful reward.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury;- beneath them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall say: \"Praise be to Allah, who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of Allah: indeed it was the truth, that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us.\" And they shall hear the cry: \"Behold! the garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors, for your deeds (of righteousness).\"","commentary":"Continuing the description of the believers' state in Paradise, this verse emphasizes their complete peace and joy. Allah will remove any lingering feelings of resentment or ill-will from their hearts, ensuring perfect harmony among them. They will dwell in a beautiful environment with rivers flowing beneath them. They will express deep gratitude to Allah for guiding them to this state, acknowledging that they could not have found the way without His guidance and confirming that the messengers brought the absolute truth. A voice will then confirm that Paradise is their inheritance as a result of their righteous actions in the worldly life. This contrasts sharply with the mutual cursing among the people of the Fire.","arabic":"وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهِمُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلَا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ ۖ لَقَدْ جَاءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ ۖ وَنُودُوا أَنْ تِلْكُمُ الْجَنَّةُ أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: \"We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord's promises true?\" They shall say, \"Yes\"; but a crier shall proclaim between them: \"The curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers;-","commentary":"This verse portrays a dramatic scene where the people of Paradise call out to the people of the Fire, having settled into their respective eternal abodes. The people of Paradise will affirm that they have found Allah's promises to them to be true and then ask the people of the Fire if they too have found Allah's warnings to be true. The people of the Fire will confirm this with a simple \"Yes.\" The verse then mentions a voice proclaiming that Allah's curse is upon the wrongdoers. This dialogue serves as a final confirmation of the truth brought by the messengers and the reality of the judgment, defining the \"wrongdoers\" as those subject to Allah's curse.","arabic":"وَنَادَىٰ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَابَ النَّارِ أَنْ قَدْ وَجَدْنَا مَا وَعَدَنَا رَبُّنَا حَقًّا فَهَلْ وَجَدْتُمْ مَا وَعَدَ رَبُّكُمْ حَقًّا ۖ قَالُوا نَعَمْ ۚ فَأَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ بَيْنَهُمْ أَنْ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"\"Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: they were those who denied the Hereafter.\"","commentary":"This verse defines those who are described in the previous dialogue as \"wrongdoers.\" It explains that these are people who deliberately prevent others from following the straightforward way of life guided by Allah. They try to make this path seem complex or incorrect, preferring to follow twisted or different ways themselves. A key characteristic of these individuals is that they reject the belief in life after death, which influences their actions in this world. This verse helps clarify who is being discussed in the unfolding scene of the Hereafter.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا وَهُمْ بِالْآخِرَةِ كَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Between them shall be a veil, and on the heights will be men who would know every one by his marks: they will call out to the Companions of the Garden, \"peace on you\": they will not have entered, but they will have an assurance (thereof).","commentary":"This verse introduces a new element in the scene of the Hereafter, positioning it between Paradise (the Garden) and Hell (the Fire). It describes a barrier or veil separating the inhabitants of these two places. On elevated positions, referred to as \"the Heights,\" are individuals who can recognize everyone else by their appearance or features. These people on the Heights call out to those destined for Paradise, greeting them with peace, though they have not yet entered Paradise themselves. The commentary suggests these might be people whose good and bad deeds were equal, leaving their fate pending Allah's grace. This scene shows a third group observing the outcomes of the inhabitants of Paradise and Hell.","arabic":"وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ ۚ وَعَلَى الْأَعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ يَعْرِفُونَ كُلًّا بِسِيمَاهُمْ ۚ وَنَادَوْا أَصْحَابَ الْجَنَّةِ أَنْ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they will say: \"Our Lord! send us not to the company of the wrong-doers.\"","commentary":"Continuing the scene on the Heights from the previous verse, this verse describes the reaction of those on the Heights when they look towards the inhabitants of Hell. Seeing the difficult situation of those in the Fire, they immediately turn to Allah, pleading not to be placed among them. This highlights their strong desire to be saved from the fate of those who chose a path away from Allah's guidance.","arabic":"وَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَارُهُمْ تِلْقَاءَ أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ قَالُوا رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"The men on the heights will call to certain men whom they will know from their marks, saying: \"Of what profit to you were your hoards and your arrogant ways?","commentary":"The narrative returns to the people on the Heights, who now specifically address some prominent individuals among the inhabitants of Hell, recognizing them by their distinct features. They question these formerly influential people about the value of the wealth, power, or arrogance they possessed in their earthly lives. The point being made is that none of their worldly possessions or pride could protect them from their current difficult situation, linking back to the consequences of rejecting Allah's guidance mentioned earlier.","arabic":"وَنَادَىٰ أَصْحَابُ الْأَعْرَافِ رِجَالًا يَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِسِيمَاهُمْ قَالُوا مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"\"Behold! are these not the men whom you swore that Allah with His Mercy would never bless? Enter ye the Garden: no fear shall be on you, nor shall ye grieve.\"","commentary":"Still addressing the prominent figures in Hell, the people on the Heights remind them of how they used to dismiss and look down upon the believers in the worldly life, confidently stating that Allah would never show them mercy. Immediately after this reminder, the scene shifts, and the believers are addressed directly, receiving the welcome to enter Paradise. They are assured that once inside, they will experience no fear or sorrow. This contrast starkly illustrates the reversal of fortunes between those who rejected and those who followed Allah's path, fulfilling the promises and warnings conveyed through the messengers.","arabic":"أَهَٰؤُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ أَقْسَمْتُمْ لَا يَنَالُهُمُ اللَّهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ ۚ ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَا أَنْتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: \"Pour down to us water or anything that Allah doth provide for your sustenance.\" They will say: \"Both these things hath Allah forbidden to those who rejected Him.\"","commentary":"Following the scene on the Heights, this verse depicts a direct exchange between the inhabitants of Hell and the inhabitants of Paradise. Those suffering in the Fire call out, pleading for relief, specifically asking for water or any form of sustenance that Allah has provided to the people of Paradise. This desperate plea highlights their intense need and suffering. The initial part of the reply from the people of Paradise is given, stating that Allah has prohibited both water and sustenance from those who disbelieved, reinforcing the separation and the consequences of disbelief. This verse directly follows the contrast shown in the previous verse, depicting the final, unalterable state of each group.","arabic":"وَنَادَىٰ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ أَصْحَابَ الْجَنَّةِ أَنْ أَفِيضُوا عَلَيْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"\"Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play, and were deceived by the life of the world.\" That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they were wont to reject Our signs.","commentary":"This verse continues the reply from the people of Paradise (or states Allah's judgment) to the plea from the people of Hell in the previous verse. It explains *why* they are forbidden sustenance and water. It defines them as those who treated the guidance from Allah and the practice of religion as trivial matters, like mere play or amusement. They were misled by the temporary pleasures and distractions of the worldly life, causing them to forget or ignore the reality of this Day of Judgement. As a consequence of their forgetting this significant meeting and constantly rejecting the signs sent by Allah, they are now, in a sense, \"forgotten\" or disregarded by Allah in their time of need. This shows the direct link between their actions in life and their fate in the Hereafter.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا دِينَهُمْ لَهْوًا وَلَعِبًا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا ۚ فَالْيَوْمَ نَنْسَاهُمْ كَمَا نَسُوا لِقَاءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَٰذَا وَمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"For We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe.","commentary":"Shifting slightly from the dialogue, this verse emphasizes that Allah did not leave these people without guidance. It states that Allah had sent a divine Book (referring to revealed scriptures like the Qur'an, sent through messengers) which was founded on His perfect knowledge and explained clearly and in detail. This Book was intended to be a source of guidance and mercy for those who choose to believe. This serves as a reminder that the people now suffering had been given the means to know the truth and avoid their fate, directly contrasting with their behavior described in the previous verse where they took their religion as amusement and rejected signs.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَاهُمْ بِكِتَابٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"Do they just wait for the final fulfilment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: \"The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past.\" In fact they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch.","commentary":"This verse describes the attitude of those who disregarded Allah's guidance (mentioned in the previous verse) and how they will react when the Day of Judgement (referred to as \"the event\") actually occurs. It asks if they were simply waiting for the warnings to come true before believing. It then portrays their realization on that Day, confirming that the messengers of Allah had indeed spoken the truth. In their desperation, they will wish for someone to intercede on their behalf or beg for a chance to return to their earthly lives to act differently. The verse concludes by stating that their opportunity is over; they have caused their own loss, and everything they relied on besides Allah has abandoned them. This verse shows the final and irreversible consequence of their denial and connects their past disregard for the Book and messengers to their present regret and helplessness.","arabic":"هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا تَأْوِيلَهُ ۚ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي تَأْوِيلُهُ يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ نَسُوهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ قَدْ جَاءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ فَهَلْ لَنَا مِنْ شُفَعَاءَ فَيَشْفَعُوا لَنَا أَوْ نُرَدُّ فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ الَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ ۚ قَدْ خَسِرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"Your Guardian-Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne (of authority): He draweth the night as a veil o'er the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession: He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed be Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!","commentary":"This verse introduces us to Allah, describing Him as your Creator and Sustainer. It tells us that Allah created the vast universe – the heavens and the earth – over six periods. It also states that He is established on the throne of authority, which signifies His absolute control and power over all creation, a concept beyond human understanding. The verse highlights specific examples of His power and control in the universe: He causes the night to follow the day in rapid succession, and He created the sun, moon, and stars, all of which operate according to laws set by Him. The verse concludes by affirming that because Allah is the sole Creator and Controller, He alone possesses the right to govern everything. This profound display of Allah's power and authority in the universe serves as a foundation for understanding why He alone is deserving of worship and submission, setting the stage for the instructions that follow in the next verses.","arabic":"إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"55","text":"Call on your Lord with humility and in private: for Allah loveth not those who trespass beyond bounds.","commentary":"Following the description of Allah's immense power and authority in the universe in the previous verse, this verse instructs us on how we should approach Him. It advises calling upon Allah – through prayer or supplication – with humility and sincerity, ideally in a quiet, private manner. This highlights a close and personal relationship with Allah, showing reverence for His greatness while acknowledging our need for Him. The verse also contains a warning that Allah does not approve of those who \"trespass beyond bounds.\" This refers to exceeding limits set by Allah, which includes acting arrogantly, claiming authority that belongs only to Allah, or causing disruption in the world, as discussed further in the next verse.","arabic":"ادْعُوا رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Do no mischief on the earth, after it hath been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing (in your hearts): for the Mercy of Allah is (always) near to those who do good.","commentary":"Building on the call to humility and proper conduct from the previous verse, this verse gives a clear command: do not cause disorder or harm on Earth, especially after Allah has established order and harmony within it. It reiterates the importance of calling upon Allah, adding that this should be done with a combination of respectful awe (fear) and earnest desire (longing) for His pleasure and reward. This balance reflects a sincere relationship with Allah, being mindful of His power while also having hope in His kindness. The verse then offers encouragement by stating that Allah's mercy is always close to those who strive to do good and live righteously. This connection between sincere supplication, avoiding disruption, and doing good leads into the next verse, which provides a vivid example of Allah's mercy and power in action.","arabic":"وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَاحِهَا وَادْعُوهُ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا ۚ إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy: when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to descend thereon, and produce every kind of harvest therewith: thus shall We raise up the dead: perchance ye may remember.","commentary":"This verse offers a powerful illustration of Allah's mercy mentioned in the previous verse (56) and His power described earlier (54). It describes a natural process we observe: Allah sends winds that carry clouds, which then bring rain to dry, barren land. This rain revitalizes the land, causing vegetation and various kinds of crops to grow. The verse highlights that these events, though they follow natural patterns, are ultimately directed by Allah's will. Crucially, the verse then draws a profound parallel: just as Allah brings life back to dead land through rain, He will also bring people back to life after death. This serves as a compelling sign to remind us of Allah's power over life and death and the reality of resurrection.","arabic":"وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرًا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَتِهِ ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَقَلَّتْ سَحَابًا ثِقَالًا سُقْنَاهُ لِبَلَدٍ مَيِّتٍ فَأَنْزَلْنَا بِهِ الْمَاءَ فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نُخْرِجُ الْمَوْتَىٰ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, (rich) after its kind: but from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is niggardly: thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols) to those who are grateful.","commentary":"Following the illustration of life coming from dead land in the previous verse (57), this verse uses the analogy of different types of land to describe how people respond to divine guidance. It states that good, fertile land readily produces abundant and beneficial growth when it receives water (like rain). In contrast, poor or hard land yields very little, or only sparse and perhaps useless, growth. This is likened to how different hearts receive Allah's messages or guidance. Receptive, open hearts are like good land, benefiting greatly from the guidance and producing positive actions and results. Unreceptive hearts are like bad land, benefiting little and yielding only negativity. The verse concludes by saying that Allah presents these signs and lessons in various ways, specifically for \"those who are grateful.\" This suggests that having a thankful and receptive attitude is key to understanding and benefiting from Allah's guidance.","arabic":"وَالْبَلَدُ الطَّيِّبُ يَخْرُجُ نَبَاتُهُ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِ ۖ وَالَّذِي خَبُثَ لَا يَخْرُجُ إِلَّا نَكِدًا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"We sent Noah to his people. He said: \"O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day!","commentary":"This verse begins the story of Prophet Noah, explaining that Allah sent him to his community. Prophet Noah delivered a fundamental message, central to the teachings of all messengers: to worship Allah alone, because there is no deity other than Him. He also warned his people out of concern for them, fearing that they would face a severe punishment on a future, dreadful day if they rejected this truth. This highlights the core call of the prophets and the warning that accompanies its rejection.","arabic":"لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ إِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ"},{"verse":"60","text":"The leaders of his people said: \"Ah! we see thee evidently wandering (in mind).\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Noah's clear message calling them to worship Allah alone, the prominent individuals and leaders among his people rejected him. They dismissed his call and accused him of being misguided or confused, demonstrating their resistance to the divine guidance he brought.","arabic":"قَالَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْ قَوْمِهِ إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"61","text":"He said: \"O my people! No wandering is there in my (mind): on the contrary I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds!","commentary":"Prophet Noah responded to the leaders' accusation by clarifying his position. He firmly denied being misguided. Instead, he asserted that he was a messenger sent from Allah, who is the Lord and Sustainer of all creation. This was his clear declaration of his mission and the source of his message.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِي ضَلَالَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"\"I but fulfil towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: Sincere is my advice to you, and I know from Allah something that ye know not.","commentary":"Continuing his response, Prophet Noah explained that he was simply fulfilling his responsibility by delivering the message entrusted to him by Allah. He emphasized that his counsel to them was sincere and truthful, motivated by genuine care for their well-being. He also indicated that he possessed knowledge from Allah through divine revelation that they did not have access to. This sets the context for why they should listen to him.","arabic":"أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالَاتِ رَبِّي وَأَنْصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"\"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you,- so that ye may fear Allah and haply receive His Mercy?\"","commentary":"Prophet Noah addresses what he perceived as their surprise or objection to his message. He questioned why they found it strange that a reminder or warning from Allah would come to them through a human being from their own community. The purpose of this messenger was to warn them against disbelief, guiding them to be mindful of Allah, with the hope that they might earn His mercy. This highlights that messengers are typically chosen from within the communities they are sent to, making the message relatable.","arabic":"أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ أَنْ جَاءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ لِيُنْذِرَكُمْ وَلِتَتَّقُوا وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"But they rejected him, and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: but We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people!","commentary":"Despite Prophet Noah's sincere efforts, his people rejected him and refused to accept Allah's message. As a consequence of their rejection, Allah saved Prophet Noah and the believers who followed him by means of the Ark, while those who denied and rejected Allah's signs were completely destroyed by a flood. The verse describes those who rejected the message as \"blind people,\" referring to their inability to recognize or respond to the clear truth and guidance presented to them.","arabic":"فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَنْجَيْنَاهُ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ فِي الْفُلْكِ وَأَغْرَقْنَا الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا قَوْمًا عَمِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"To the 'Ad people, (We sent) Hud, one of their (own) brethren: He said: O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him will ye not fear (Allah)?\"","commentary":"Following the account of Prophet Noah, this verse introduces the story of Prophet Hud, who was sent to the people of 'Ad. Just as Prophet Noah was sent to his community, Prophet Hud was sent to the 'Ad people, being one of their own. His message was the same core message: to worship Allah alone, as there is no other deity. He also prompted them to consider whether they would not be mindful of Allah, implying that recognizing Allah's power and sovereignty should lead them to righteousness and fear of His punishment. This continues the theme of prophets delivering the same fundamental message across different times and people.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُودًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۚ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"The leaders of the Unbelievers among his people said: \"Ah! we see thou art an imbecile!\" and \"We think thou art a liar!\"","commentary":"Similar to the reaction of Prophet Noah's people, the leaders of the disbelievers among the 'Ad people rejected Prophet Hud's call. They responded with insults, claiming he was foolish or weak-minded, and also accusing him of being a liar regarding his claim to be a messenger from Allah. This shows a recurring pattern of resistance and personal attacks against the prophets by those in positions of power who felt threatened by the call to submit to Allah alone.","arabic":"قَالَ الْمَلَأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي سَفَاهَةٍ وَإِنَّا لَنَظُنُّكَ مِنَ الْكَاذِبِينَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"He said: \"O my people! I am no imbecile, but (I am) a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds!","commentary":"Prophet Hud responded to their accusations by clearly denying that he was weak-minded or foolish. Just like Prophet Noah before him (in verse 61), he affirmed his true identity as a messenger from Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all creation. This reiterates the source and authority of his message.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِي سَفَاهَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"\"I but fulfil towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser.","commentary":"Prophet Hud continued to explain his role, stating that he was simply carrying out the duty assigned to him by Allah, his Lord. He clarified that his intention was to be a sincere and trustworthy adviser to them, offering guidance for their benefit. This emphasizes the role of the prophet as a trustworthy guide delivering Allah's message for the well-being of the community, echoing Prophet Noah's statement in verse 62 about his sincerity and delivery of Allah's messages.","arabic":"أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالَاتِ رَبِّي وَأَنَا لَكُمْ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ"},{"verse":"69","text":"\"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people, to warn you? call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you a stature tall among the nations. Call in remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah: that so ye may prosper.\"","commentary":"Continuing the account of the Prophet Hud calling his people, the 'Ad, to worship Allah alone, this verse highlights a common theme: people often question why Allah sends a messenger from among themselves. Prophet Hud points out that this is not strange; it is a reminder from Allah intended to warn them and guide them to a righteous path. He then prompts them to remember Allah's blessings upon them, specifically how He made them inheritors of the land after the destruction of Noah's people and granted them physical strength and prominence. Remembering these favors should inspire gratitude and lead them to seek success by following Allah's guidance.","arabic":"أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ أَنْ جَاءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ لِيُنْذِرَكُمْ ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَاءَ مِنْ بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِي الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً ۖ فَاذْكُرُوا آلَاءَ اللَّهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"They said: \"Comest thou to us, that we may worship Allah alone, and give up the cult of our fathers? bring us what thou threatenest us with, if so be that thou tellest the truth!\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Hud's call to worship Allah alone and abandon the traditions of their ancestors, the leaders of the 'Ad people show arrogance and defiance. They express their unwillingness to give up their inherited practices. Their challenge to Prophet Hud is direct and dismissive: if he is truthful about the punishment he warns them of, they demand that he bring it upon them immediately. This response underscores their rejection of the core message and their overconfidence in their own power, ignoring the reminders of Allah's past actions towards defiant nations.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَجِئْتَنَا لِنَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ وَحْدَهُ وَنَذَرَ مَا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا ۖ فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَا إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"He said: \"Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord: dispute ye with me over names which ye have devised - ye and your fathers,- without authority from Allah? then wait: I am amongst you, also waiting.\"","commentary":"Prophet Hud replies to their challenge, stating that the punishment and wrath they are asking for have, in fact, already become certain for them due to their rejection. He points out the absurdity of their devotion to idols or practices that are merely \"names\" they and their ancestors invented, having no real authority or power granted by Allah. Their worship is based on baseless tradition, not divine truth. He then accepts their challenge to wait for Allah's judgment, asserting his own readiness as one who trusts in Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ قَدْ وَقَعَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ رِجْسٌ وَغَضَبٌ ۖ أَتُجَادِلُونَنِي فِي أَسْمَاءٍ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنْتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُمْ مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ ۚ فَانْتَظِرُوا إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الْمُنْتَظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"We saved him and those who adhered to him. By Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe.","commentary":"Following the defiance of the 'Ad people and the challenge issued in the previous verses, this verse declares the outcome. Allah, out of His mercy, saved Prophet Hud and the small group of believers who stood with him. In contrast, those who rejected Allah's signs and refused to believe were utterly destroyed, with their power and existence completely eradicated. This serves as a fulfillment of the warnings given and a clear demonstration of the consequences of rejecting the message brought by Allah's messenger.","arabic":"فَأَنْجَيْنَاهُ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنَّا وَقَطَعْنَا دَابِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا ۖ وَمَا كَانُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"To the Thamud people (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren: He said: \"O my people! worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! This she-camel of Allah is a Sign unto you: So leave her to graze in Allah's earth, and let her come to no harm, or ye shall be seized with a grievous punishment.","commentary":"The narrative moves to the people of Thamud, to whom Prophet Salih, one of their own, was sent. Just like the prophets before him, his primary message was the same: to worship Allah alone, as there is no deity worthy of worship but Him. He informed them that Allah had sent them a clear sign to prove his truthfulness – a special she-camel. Prophet Salih instructed them to leave this she-camel to graze freely on Allah's earth and warned them severely against harming her, stating that doing so would bring upon them a grievous punishment. This verse introduces a specific miracle as evidence, connecting belief in Allah to respecting His signs and creations.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً ۖ فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِي أَرْضِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"74","text":"\"And remember how He made you inheritors after the 'Ad people and gave you habitations in the land: ye build for yourselves palaces and castles in (open) plains, and carve out homes in the mountains; so bring to remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah, and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth.\"","commentary":"Prophet Salih continues his address, reminding the Thamud people of Allah's favors upon them, just as Prophet Hud reminded the 'Ad. He recalls how Allah made them successors to the 'Ad people and gave them power and wealth, enabling them to build impressive structures in the plains and carve dwellings into the mountains. These reminders of Allah's blessings are intended to encourage gratitude and humility. He urges them to remember these favors and to refrain from spreading corruption and mischief on the earth, linking their prosperity directly to their behavior and urging them to learn from the fate of previous nations.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَاءَ مِنْ بَعْدِ عَادٍ وَبَوَّأَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْ سُهُولِهَا قُصُورًا وَتَنْحِتُونَ الْجِبَالَ بُيُوتًا ۖ فَاذْكُرُوا آلَاءَ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless - those among them who believed: \"know ye indeed that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?\" They said: \"We do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him.\"","commentary":"This verse shows the division among the Thamud people. The powerful and arrogant leaders, who resisted Prophet Salih's message because it threatened their authority, turned their attention to the believers, particularly those they considered weak or less influential. They challenged the believers' certainty about Prophet Salih's claim to prophethood. The believers, firm in their faith, responded with conviction, stating their belief in the message revealed through Prophet Salih. This highlights the contrast between the arrogant disbelief of the elite and the steadfast faith of those who submitted to Allah.","arabic":"قَالَ الْمَلَأُ الَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُوا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُوا لِمَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ أَتَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ صَالِحًا مُرْسَلٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۚ قَالُوا إِنَّا بِمَا أُرْسِلَ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"The Arrogant party said: \"For our part, we reject what ye believe in.\"","commentary":"Following the believers' declaration of faith in the previous verse, the arrogant leaders of the Thamud people make their position unequivocally clear. They openly state their rejection of the message and beliefs that the followers of Prophet Salih have accepted. This outright rejection, despite the clear signs and reminders given, demonstrates their deliberate choice to oppose divine guidance and maintain their resistance to worshipping Allah alone.","arabic":"قَالَ الَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُوا إِنَّا بِالَّذِي آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"Then they ham-strung the she-camel, and insolently defied the order of their Lord, saying: \"O Salih! bring about thy threats, if thou art a messenger (of Allah)!\"","commentary":"Escalating their defiance from mere rejection, the arrogant leaders and their followers committed a grave act against the clear sign given by Allah. They harmed the she-camel, directly violating Prophet Salih's command which was given on behalf of Allah. This act is described as insolent defiance of Allah's order. Immediately after this provocative action, they mockingly challenged Prophet Salih to bring about the punishment he had warned them about, daring him to prove he was truly a messenger from Allah. This act was the final provocation that sealed their fate.","arabic":"فَعَقَرُوا النَّاقَةَ وَعَتَوْا عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ وَقَالُوا يَا صَالِحُ ائْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَا إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"So the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning!","commentary":"This verse describes the swift and decisive consequence of the Thamud people's defiance and challenge to Prophet Salih and Allah's command. An earthquake struck them suddenly, catching them unprepared in their homes. The description of them lying \"prostrate\" refers to their lifeless state on the ground. This punishment was a direct and immediate response to their arrogant rejection of Allah's signs, their harming of the she-camel, and their challenge to Prophet Salih in the previous verse, serving as a powerful illustration of the inevitable outcome of rejecting divine guidance.","arabic":"فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"So Salih left them, saying: \"O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but ye love not good counsellors!\"","commentary":"This verse concludes the story of Prophet Salih and his people, the Thamud. Having witnessed the punishment that befell them due to their defiance and rejection of Allah's message, Prophet Salih turns away from their lifeless forms. He states clearly that he had delivered the message from his Lord (Allah) and offered sincere advice, but they did not appreciate those who gave good counsel. This marks the end of his responsibility towards them after their final rejection. It directly follows the description of their destruction in the previous verse, emphasizing Prophet Salih's fulfillment of his duty before their inevitable end.","arabic":"فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَةَ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تُحِبُّونَ النَّاصِحِينَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"We also (sent) Lut: He said to his people: \"Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you?","commentary":"Moving to a new historical account, this verse introduces Prophet Lut (Lot). It highlights a severe moral issue prevalent among his people, describing their actions as an unprecedented indecency. This sets the stage for the confrontation between Prophet Lut's call to righteousness and his people's deep-seated perversion. Unlike the previous stories which primarily focused on polytheism and economic dishonesty, this account brings forth a specific moral deviation from Allah's established order, showing different ways communities stray from guidance.","arabic":"وَلُوطًا إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَتَأْتُونَ الْفَاحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُمْ بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِنَ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"\"For ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.\"","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the specific indecency mentioned in the previous one. Prophet Lut clarifies that his people were engaging in sexual acts with men instead of women. He describes them as \"transgressing beyond bounds,\" meaning they were exceeding the limits set by Allah and deviating significantly from the natural way human beings were created and are meant to interact. This continues the theme of deviation from Allah's order introduced in the preceding verse, specifying the nature of the perversion.","arabic":"إِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ الرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِنْ دُونِ النِّسَاءِ ۚ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُسْرِفُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"And his people gave no answer but this: they said, \"Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!\"","commentary":"This verse presents the astonishing response of Prophet Lut's people to his message. Instead of considering his warning, they demanded that Prophet Lut and his followers be expelled from the city. Their reasoning was particularly revealing: they considered Prophet Lut and those who believed with him to be undesirable simply because they sought to be \"clean and pure.\" This highlights a complete reversal of moral standards, where purity is viewed negatively, showcasing the extent of their moral corruption and defiance against Prophet Lut's call for righteousness. It shows how deep their perversion was, to the point of rejecting anyone who upheld moral cleanliness.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ قَالُوا أَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ قَرْيَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"But we saved him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who legged behind.","commentary":"Following the rejection and threat of expulsion by Prophet Lut's people, this verse states that Allah saved Prophet Lut and his believing family. However, a significant exception is noted: his wife was not saved. This is explained by stating she \"lagged behind,\" which, in the context of Islamic belief, implies she did not share his faith or follow his path. This emphasizes that salvation depends on one's faith and actions, not merely on family ties, providing a stark contrast to the destruction that was about to befall those who rejected Allah's message.","arabic":"فَأَنْجَيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلَّا امْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ الْغَابِرِينَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!","commentary":"This verse describes the punishment inflicted by Allah upon Prophet Lut's people for their persistent perversion and rejection of His messenger. A severe \"rain\" of destruction was sent down upon them, bringing about their end. The verse concludes by calling attention to the outcome for these people who engaged in such severe sins and crimes, serving as a warning to others. This verse brings the story of Prophet Lut and his community to a close, similar to how the stories of Noah, Hud, and Salih ended, illustrating the consequences of rejecting Allah's guidance and His messengers.","arabic":"وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَطَرًا ۖ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"To the Madyan people We sent Shu'aib, one of their own brethren: he said: \"O my people! worship Allah; Ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due; and do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order: that will be best for you, if ye have Faith.","commentary":"This verse introduces the story of Prophet Shu'aib, sent to the people of Madyan. As with previous prophets, his primary message was to worship Allah alone, acknowledging no other deity. He also mentioned that a \"clear Sign\" had come from Allah, confirming his prophethood (the nature of this sign is not detailed here but confirms he brought proof). Distinctive to this community, Prophet Shu'aib also addressed specific social and economic issues: dishonesty in business dealings (short-changing in measure and weight) and general corruption. He linked these practices directly to faith, stating that upholding justice and avoiding corruption would be best for them if they truly believed. This transitions the narrative to a community facing challenges not just in belief but also in their daily transactions and social order, showing that submission to Allah encompasses all aspects of life.","arabic":"وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءَهُمْ وَلَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلَاحِهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"\"And squat not on every road, breathing threats, hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking in it something crooked; But remember how ye were little, and He gave you increase. And hold in your mind's eye what was the end of those who did mischief.","commentary":"Continuing his address, Prophet Shu'aib adds further warnings against harmful social practices. He tells his people not to obstruct roads, threaten people, or actively prevent believers from following Allah's path, attempting to make the straight path seem wrong. He reminds them of Allah's past favors, recalling a time when they were few in number and Allah caused them to multiply, urging gratitude. He also reminds them to remember the fate of earlier corrupt nations (like those mentioned in previous verses), connecting their actions to potential divine consequences. This verse expands on the social implications of faith, highlighting the prophet's concern not just with belief but also with the safety and freedom of believers and the just functioning of society. It directly follows the call for justice and order, showing how their corruption manifested in social oppression.","arabic":"وَلَا تَقْعُدُوا بِكُلِّ صِرَاطٍ تُوعِدُونَ وَتَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِهِ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلًا فَكَثَّرَكُمْ ۖ وَانْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"\"And if there is a party among you who believes in the message with which I have been sent, and a party which does not believe, hold yourselves in patience until Allah doth decide between us: for He is the best to decide.","commentary":"In this verse, Prophet Shu'aib proposes a course of action acknowledging the division among his people: some believe, and some do not. He suggests that both groups should remain patient and await Allah's judgment to decide between them, affirming that Allah's decision is the ultimate and best. This can be interpreted as a call for a period of forbearance or a declaration that the final outcome rests with divine justice, not human conflict at that moment. It follows his earlier warnings and calls for reform, presenting a way to handle the inherent conflict arising from the community's division over faith.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَانَ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْكُمْ آمَنُوا بِالَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ وَطَائِفَةٌ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا فَاصْبِرُوا حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَنَا ۚ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَاكِمِينَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"The leaders, the arrogant party among his people, said: \"O Shu'aib! we shall certainly drive thee out of our city - (thee) and those who believe with thee; or else ye (thou and they) shall have to return to our ways and religion.\" He said: \"What! even though we do detest (them)?","commentary":"This verse gives the response of the powerful, arrogant leaders of Prophet Shu'aib's people to his message and his offer in the previous verse. Instead of accepting his proposal for patience or considering his warnings, they issued an ultimatum: Prophet Shu'aib and his followers must either be expelled from their city or abandon their faith and return to the practices and beliefs of the leaders. This demonstrates their unwillingness to tolerate the presence of believers and their insistence on conformity to their own ways. Prophet Shu'aib's immediate rhetorical question in reply (\"What! even though we do detest [them]?\"), shows his strong rejection of their demand and his commitment to the truth, even if it means facing expulsion, setting up the confrontation that follows.","arabic":"قَالَ الْمَلَأُ الَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُوا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يَا شُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَكَ مِنْ قَرْيَتِنَا أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا ۚ قَالَ أَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَارِهِينَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"\"We should indeed invent a lie against Allah, if we returned to your ways after Allah hath rescued us therefrom; nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of Allah, Our Lord. Our Lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things by His knowledge. In the Allah is our trust. our Lord! decide Thou between us and our people in truth, for Thou art the best to decide.\"","commentary":"Here, Prophet Shu'aib responds to the arrogant leaders of his people who threatened to expel him and his followers unless they abandoned their faith and returned to the old ways. Prophet Shu'aib states firmly that it would be a fabrication against Allah if they were to go back to those wrong ways after Allah had guided them to the truth and saved them from deviation. He emphasizes that returning to those ways is not something they would ever conceive unless it was part of Allah's ultimate plan, acknowledging that Allah, their Lord, has complete knowledge of everything. Prophet Shu'aib declares his full reliance and trust in Allah. He then turns to Allah in prayer, asking Him to judge truthfully between the believers and the disbelievers, recognizing Allah as the best and most just judge. This prayer highlights the believers' reliance on divine justice in the face of persecution.","arabic":"قَدِ افْتَرَيْنَا عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا إِنْ عُدْنَا فِي مِلَّتِكُمْ بَعْدَ إِذْ نَجَّانَا اللَّهُ مِنْهَا ۚ وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَا أَنْ نَعُودَ فِيهَا إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَاءَ اللَّهُ رَبُّنَا ۚ وَسِعَ رَبُّنَا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا ۚ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ وَأَنْتَ خَيْرُ الْفَاتِحِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"The leaders, the unbelievers among his people, said: \"If ye follow Shu'aib, be sure then ye are ruined!\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Shu'aib's firm declaration of faith and trust in Allah, the powerful disbelieving leaders among his people issue a warning or threat. They tell those who are considering following Prophet Shu'aib's message that if they choose to do so, they will face ruin. This shows the lengths to which the disbelievers would go to discourage people from accepting the truth, using intimidation and threats of worldly harm to maintain their influence and oppose the call to worship Allah alone and live justly. This sets up the contrast with the ultimate fate that would befall those who rejected the message, as described in the following verses.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الْمَلَأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ لَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتُمْ شُعَيْبًا إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا لَخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"But the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning!","commentary":"Despite the arrogant threats of the disbelieving leaders mentioned in the previous verse, the outcome was dramatically different for them. This verse describes a sudden, unexpected divine punishment that struck the people who rejected Prophet Shu'aib. An earthquake seized them, and they were found lying lifeless in their homes by morning. This swift destruction stands in stark contrast to their earlier power and arrogance, demonstrating the ultimate power of Allah and the consequences of rejecting His message and His messengers.","arabic":"فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"The men who reject Shu'aib became as if they had never been in the homes where they had flourished: the men who rejected Shu'aib - it was they who were ruined!","commentary":"Building upon the description of the sudden destruction in the previous verse, this verse emphasizes the totality of the punishment. The people who rejected Prophet Shu'aib were so completely annihilated that it was as if they had never existed or flourished in their homes. This verse directly refutes the threat made by the disbelieving leaders in Verse 90, where they warned the believers that *they* would be ruined if they followed Prophet Shu'aib. The Qur'an declares that the real losers, who faced ruin, were precisely those who rejected Prophet Shu'aib and Allah's message.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا شُعَيْبًا كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا ۚ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا شُعَيْبًا كَانُوا هُمُ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"So Shu'aib left them, saying: \"O my people! I did indeed convey to you the messages for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe!\"","commentary":"After the divine punishment befell the disbelievers, Prophet Shu'aib departed from their land. His final words to them, even in their destruction, serve as a confirmation of his role and effort. He stated that he had faithfully delivered the messages entrusted to him by Allah and had given them sincere and beneficial advice. His statement, \"how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe!\", does not imply a lack of compassion initially, but rather a recognition that they brought this fate upon themselves by their persistent and willful rejection of faith, despite his earnest efforts and clear warnings. It marks the final separation between the prophet and his people based on their choices regarding faith.","arabic":"فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَاتِ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ ۖ فَكَيْفَ آسَىٰ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ كَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We took up its people in suffering and adversity, in order that they might learn humility.","commentary":"This verse begins by explaining a pattern that Allah established when sending messengers to communities in the past. It tells us that when people rejected the message brought by a prophet, Allah would sometimes test them by sending suffering and hardship. This was not done out of random anger, but with a specific purpose: to make the people humble, to soften their hearts, and encourage them to turn back to Allah, recognizing their dependence on Him. This serves as a reminder that challenges in life can be opportunities for reflection and seeking a deeper connection with the Divine.","arabic":"وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِنْ نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا أَخَذْنَا أَهْلَهَا بِالْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَضَّرَّعُونَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"Then We changed their suffering into prosperity, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say: \"Our fathers (too) were touched by suffering and affluence\"... Behold! We called them to account of a sudden, while they realised not (their peril).","commentary":"Following the initial test of hardship, this verse describes a change in the pattern. If the people still did not respond with humility and turn to Allah, the hardship was replaced with prosperity and ease. Their numbers grew, and life became comfortable. However, instead of seeing this as a blessing from Allah or another test, they began to view the cycles of suffering and prosperity as simply a natural, purposeless occurrence that happened to their ancestors too. Because they became heedless and felt secure in their comfort, ignoring the divine purpose behind these events, Allah's consequence for their persistent rejection of the truth came suddenly and unexpectedly, before they could even realize the danger they were in. This highlights the importance of recognizing Allah's hand in both difficult and prosperous times.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَدَّلْنَا مَكَانَ السَّيِّئَةِ الْحَسَنَةَ حَتَّىٰ عَفَوْا وَقَالُوا قَدْ مَسَّ آبَاءَنَا الضَّرَّاءُ وَالسَّرَّاءُ فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah, We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to book for their misdeeds.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the outcome of disbelief with the outcome of faith. It states that if the people of those communities had responded to the prophets by believing in Allah and being mindful of Him in their actions, Allah would have showered them with blessings from all sources, from the sky and the earth, in abundance. These blessings would encompass all aspects of life, bringing goodness, security, and growth. However, because they chose to reject the truth and disbelieve, they faced consequences for their actions and the misdeeds that resulted from their disbelief. This verse establishes a principle: aligning oneself with Allah's guidance opens doors to goodness and prosperity, while rejecting it leads to negative consequences.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَىٰ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَرَكَاتٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِنْ كَذَّبُوا فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep?","commentary":"Moving on, this verse directly challenges the sense of security that people might develop, especially after experiencing prosperity as mentioned in the previous verses. It asks whether the people of these towns felt so safe that they assumed they were immune from Allah's judgment coming upon them during the night, while they were in their most vulnerable state, asleep and unaware. This question encourages reflection on how powerless we are, particularly during sleep, against something as mighty as Allah's decree.","arabic":"أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَنْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتًا وَهُمْ نَائِمُونَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about (care-free)?","commentary":"This verse continues the challenge to a false sense of security, asking if they felt safe from Allah's judgment striking them during the day, while they were awake but distracted by their daily activities and leisure. The commentary highlights that even when people are awake and engaged in their busy lives, they can still be completely unaware or heedless of impending consequences. Whether by night or day, in vulnerability or distraction, Allah's plan can unfold.","arabic":"أَوَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَنْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allah?- but no one can feel secure from the Plan of Allah, except those (doomed) to ruin!","commentary":"Following the specific questions about feeling secure at night or day, this verse poses a broader question about feeling secure from Allah's overall plan and design for human affairs. It emphasizes that it is impossible for anyone to be truly secure or immune from Allah's plan, which is comprehensive and unfolds according to His will. The verse sternly states that only those who are ultimately destined for loss or ruin would feel secure from Allah's plan, implying that such a feeling is a sign of being misguided and heading towards a detrimental end. It's a call to constant mindfulness and awareness of Allah's presence and power in all aspects of life.","arabic":"أَفَأَمِنُوا مَكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ فَلَا يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"To those who inherit the earth in succession to its (previous) possessors, is it not a guiding, (lesson) that, if We so willed, We could punish them (too) for their sins, and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear?","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the generations who come after those who were destroyed, the current inheritors of the land. It serves as a direct warning and a lesson derived from the stories just related. It asks if it isn't clear to them that they, too, are subject to Allah's laws and consequences. Just as past nations were punished for their wrongdoings and their hearts were \"sealed\" (meaning they became unable to accept or understand divine guidance due to their persistent rejection), the current generations could face a similar fate if they follow the same path. The sealing of the heart is depicted as a consequence of repeated rejection, leading to an inability to benefit from guidance. This verse urges the listeners to learn from history and avoid the same mistakes.","arabic":"أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لِلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْأَرْضَ مِنْ بَعْدِ أَهْلِهَا أَنْ لَوْ نَشَاءُ أَصَبْنَاهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ ۚ وَنَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"Such were the towns whose story We (thus) relate unto thee: There came indeed to them their messengers with clear (signs): But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith.","commentary":"This verse summarizes the lessons learned from the stories of the past communities mentioned earlier in the Sura, addressing Prophet Muhammad. It confirms that these accounts are divine revelation. It reiterates that messengers were sent to these towns, bringing clear evidence of the truth. However, the people persisted in rejecting the message, showing a stubborn unwillingness to believe in something they had already dismissed. This persistent rejection led to their hearts being sealed by Allah. This isn't an arbitrary act, but a consequence where Allah confirms their choice to close themselves off from guidance, making it impossible for faith to enter hearts that are determinedly resistant.","arabic":"تِلْكَ الْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَائِهَا ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَمَا كَانُوا لِيُؤْمِنُوا بِمَا كَذَّبُوا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَطْبَعُ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"Most of them We found not men (true) to their covenant: but most of them We found rebellious and disobedient.","commentary":"Concluding the commentary on these communities, this verse provides a summary of their spiritual state. It states that Allah found the majority of these people to be untrue to their commitments. This \"covenant\" could refer to the innate human acknowledgment of Allah as Lord (mentioned elsewhere in the Qur'an) or the commitments made to follow the prophets. Regardless, the verse emphasizes that most of them failed to uphold their obligations. Furthermore, the verse describes most of them as \"rebellious and disobedient,\" indicating a persistent tendency to deviate from Allah's path and actively disobey His commands, which was the underlying cause of their ultimate fate.\n\n---","arabic":"وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِمْ مِنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِنْ وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them: So see what was the end of those who made mischief.","commentary":"This verse introduces the story of Prophet Moses, who was sent by Allah after other prophets and their communities had been mentioned earlier in this Sura. Prophet Moses was given clear signs as proof of his mission. He was sent to Pharaoh and his leading figures. However, they chose to reject these signs in a way that is described here as \"wrongful\" or \"unjust\". From an Islamic perspective, rejecting Allah's signs and messages is seen as the most severe form of injustice, as it means turning away from the fundamental truth about the Creator and exposing oneself to harm in this life and the next. It also involves acting unjustly towards others by trying to force them to submit to authorities other than Allah. The verse concludes by inviting the listener to observe the ultimate fate of those who engage in such actions, which are seen as spreading disorder or corruption. This sets the stage for the narrative that follows, which will elaborate on the interactions between Prophet Moses and Pharaoh and illustrate the consequences of their rejection.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۖ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"Moses said: \"O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds,-","commentary":"Following the introduction, the narrative moves directly to the confrontation between Prophet Moses and Pharaoh. This verse presents Prophet Moses addressing Pharaoh directly, not with titles of subservience, but by his name, while immediately stating his true identity and authority: he is a messenger from the \"Lord of all the worlds.\" This declaration is foundational in Islam – acknowledging Allah as the sole Creator and Sustainer of everything in existence. By stating this, Prophet Moses challenges Pharaoh's claim to absolute authority or divinity in a powerful and simple way, asserting that ultimate authority belongs only to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. This declaration is the core message of all prophets.","arabic":"وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يَا فِرْعَوْنُ إِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"105","text":"One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about Allah. Now have I come unto you (people), from your Lord, with a clear (Sign): So let the Children of Israel depart along with me.\"","commentary":"This verse expands on Prophet Moses' address to Pharaoh and his people. Prophet Moses emphasizes that as a messenger from Allah, he is committed to speaking only the truth about the Divine. He then states that he has brought a \"clear sign\" from Allah as proof of his message and authority. This sign is a tangible miracle intended to demonstrate that he is truly sent by the Lord of all the worlds. Based on this authority and his status as a messenger, Prophet Moses makes a specific demand: that Pharaoh release the Children of Israel and allow them to leave with him. This demand is directly linked to the preceding declaration of Allah's Lordship; recognizing Allah as the only ultimate authority implies that no human being should be held in bondage or forced to serve anyone other than Allah. The Children of Israel, being servants of Allah, should therefore not be held captive by Pharaoh.","arabic":"حَقِيقٌ عَلَىٰ أَنْ لَا أَقُولَ عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ ۚ قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِبَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعِيَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ"},{"verse":"106","text":"(Pharaoh) said: \"If indeed thou hast come with a Sign, show it forth,- if thou tellest the truth.\"","commentary":"In response to Prophet Moses' declaration and demand, and acknowledging his claim of having a \"clear sign,\" Pharaoh issues a challenge. He demands that Prophet Moses produce this sign as proof of his truthfulness. Pharaoh and his advisors, accustomed to earthly power and possibly familiar with various forms of magic or displays, likely saw this as an opportunity to expose Prophet Moses as a fraud or counter his claim by demanding verifiable proof. This reaction shows their focus on worldly evidence and their skepticism towards the divine message unless backed by something tangible they could evaluate.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنْ كُنْتَ جِئْتَ بِآيَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَا إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"107","text":"Then (Moses) threw his rod, and behold! it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)!","commentary":"Following Pharaoh's challenge to produce a sign, Prophet Moses immediately complies. This verse describes the first of the two main signs he presented at this initial confrontation. He cast down his staff, and by Allah's power, it transformed into a visible serpent. This was not an illusion but a real transformation, intended as a powerful demonstration of divine power that is far beyond human capability or conventional understanding. This sign serves as undeniable proof supporting Prophet Moses' claim that he was sent by the Lord of all the worlds.","arabic":"فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"108","text":"And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to all beholders!","commentary":"This verse presents the second clear sign displayed by Prophet Moses in response to Pharaoh's challenge. After showing the transformation of his staff, he drew his hand out, and it shone with a bright, clear light. The commentary notes that Prophet Moses had a dark complexion, making the hand's shining whiteness a visible and unusual spectacle, not due to illness. It was a temporary, miraculous change. Together with the staff turning into a serpent, this sign further confirmed the divine power supporting Prophet Moses and validated his claim as a messenger from Allah, providing undeniable evidence for Pharaoh and his people.","arabic":"وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ بَيْضَاءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh: \"This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed.","commentary":"Upon witnessing the clear and undeniable signs presented by Prophet Moses (the staff becoming a serpent and the shining hand), Pharaoh's advisors and leaders reacted. Rather than acknowledging the divine nature of the signs, they sought to dismiss them by attributing them to human skill, specifically magic or sorcery. By calling Prophet Moses a \"sorcerer well-versed,\" they attempted to frame his miracles as tricks or illusions performed by a highly skilled practitioner, thereby avoiding the conclusion that he was a messenger supported by a higher power which threatened their own authority. This reaction indicates their unwillingness to accept the truth despite the evidence.","arabic":"قَالَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْ قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"110","text":"\"His plan is to get you out of your land: then what is it ye counsel?\"","commentary":"Continuing their assessment of Prophet Moses, Pharaoh's advisors articulated the perceived underlying motive behind his message and actions. They interpreted his call to recognize the Lord of all the worlds and to release the Children of Israel as a scheme to undermine their power structure and eventually lead to their displacement from their land. They correctly perceived that acknowledging Allah's ultimate authority would challenge Pharaoh's absolute rule and the system built upon it. Framing it as a political plot to drive them out served to rally support against Prophet Moses and justify their opposition, shifting the focus from the divine message to an earthly power struggle. They then sought Pharaoh's counsel on how to deal with this perceived threat.","arabic":"يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُخْرِجَكُمْ مِنْ أَرْضِكُمْ ۖ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ"},{"verse":"111","text":"They said: \"Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while); and send to the cities men to collect-","commentary":"In response to Pharaoh seeking their advice after their interpretation of Prophet Moses' intentions, the advisors formulated a plan. Their strategy was twofold: first, to delay taking immediate action against Prophet Moses and his brother Prophet Aaron (\"Keep him and his brother in suspense\"), and second, to gather support to counter him. This second step involved sending messengers or heralds throughout the cities of Egypt.","arabic":"قَالُوا أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَأَرْسِلْ فِي الْمَدَائِنِ حَاشِرِينَ"},{"verse":"112","text":"And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed.\"","commentary":"This verse completes the strategy proposed by Pharaoh's advisors. Having dismissed Prophet Moses' miracles as sorcery, their plan was to assemble all the most skilled sorcerers from across the kingdom. The intention was to engage Prophet Moses in a contest where their combined magical abilities could openly challenge and presumably defeat what they claimed was his magic. This public display was meant to discredit Prophet Moses in the eyes of the people, reaffirm Pharaoh's authority, and negate the impact of the divine signs he had presented. This plan highlights their reliance on human skill and deception to counter what was, in reality, a manifestation of divine power.","arabic":"يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ"},{"verse":"113","text":"So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh: They said, \"of course we shall have a (suitable) reward if we win!\"","commentary":"This verse describes the arrival of the sorcerers whom Pharaoh had summoned from across the land. Having gathered the most skilled practitioners of their craft, they approached Pharaoh, expressing their expectation of a reward if they were victorious against Prophet Moses. This shows their professional nature and their focus on material gain from the contest.","arabic":"وَجَاءَ السَّحَرَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قَالُوا إِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا إِنْ كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَالِبِينَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"He said: \"Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person).\"","commentary":"In response to the sorcerers' demand for a reward, Pharaoh not only promised them suitable payment but also offered them positions of high status and proximity to him. This was meant to further incentivize them and ensure their maximum effort against Prophet Moses, demonstrating the lengths Pharaoh would go to preserve his authority and suppress the truth.","arabic":"قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ لَمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ"},{"verse":"115","text":"They said: \"O Moses! wilt thou throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw?\"","commentary":"Feeling confident in their skills and bolstered by Pharaoh's promises, the sorcerers challenged Prophet Moses. They gave him the choice of whether he or they would start the contest, signaling their readiness and perceived superiority in their craft. This verse sets the stage for the magical showdown.","arabic":"قَالُوا يَا مُوسَىٰ إِمَّا أَنْ تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّا أَنْ نَكُونَ نَحْنُ الْمُلْقِينَ"},{"verse":"116","text":"Said Moses: \"Throw ye (first).\" So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic.","commentary":"Prophet Moses calmly accepted their challenge, instructing them to go first. When the sorcerers performed their act, they created a powerful illusion that deeply affected everyone watching, making them feel great fear and awe. The Qur'an describes their feat as \"great magic,\" highlighting the intensity of their display and the challenge Prophet Moses faced.","arabic":"قَالَ أَلْقُوا ۖ فَلَمَّا أَلْقَوْا سَحَرُوا أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَاءُوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ"},{"verse":"117","text":"We put it into Moses's mind by inspiration: \"Throw (now) thy rod\": and behold! it swallows up straight away all the falsehoods which they fake!","commentary":"At this critical moment, when the sorcerers' display had overwhelmed the onlookers and even caused Prophet Moses a moment of apprehension (as mentioned elsewhere in the Qur'an), Allah inspired Prophet Moses to throw his staff. The verse immediately highlights the miraculous outcome: the staff transformed into a real serpent that devoured all the illusions created by the sorcerers. This direct divine intervention revealed the fundamental difference between their illusion and the true power from Allah. This directly counters the \"great magic\" shown in the previous verse, proving that the power of Allah's sign is superior.","arabic":"وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ ۖ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ"},{"verse":"118","text":"Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.","commentary":"Following the staff's miraculous action, the truth of Prophet Moses's message and the divine origin of his signs were undeniably established. Everything the sorcerers had created was instantly undone, revealing their magic as mere illusion and falsehood. This verse confirms the clear triumph of divine power over human trickery.","arabic":"فَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"119","text":"So the (great ones) were vanquished there and then, and were made to look small.","commentary":"As a result of the truth being confirmed and their magic being nullified, the sorcerers and, by extension, Pharaoh and his supporters were utterly defeated in front of everyone. Their grand display was exposed as powerless compared to the sign from Allah, causing them to appear humiliated and insignificant in the eyes of the public who had just witnessed their \"great magic\" exposed.","arabic":"فَغُلِبُوا هُنَالِكَ وَانْقَلَبُوا صَاغِرِينَ"},{"verse":"120","text":"But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration.","commentary":"In a surprising turn of events following their defeat and humiliation, the sorcerers had a profound realization. Recognizing that what Prophet Moses had done was not magic like theirs, but a true miracle from a higher power, their hearts were moved. They spontaneously fell into prostration, a gesture of deep reverence and submission, acknowledging the ultimate truth. This verse shows a sudden and dramatic shift in their attitude, highlighting the transformative power of witnessing a clear divine sign.","arabic":"وَأُلْقِيَ السَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ"},{"verse":"121","text":"Saying: \"We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,-","commentary":"Their prostration was accompanied by a declaration of faith. The sorcerers, now believers, announced that they accepted the Lord of the Worlds. This is the same declaration Prophet Moses had made to Pharaoh, affirming that there is one true Lord of everything in existence. This statement is a cornerstone of the message brought by all prophets. Following the previous verse, their physical act of prostration is immediately followed by this verbal declaration of their inner change.","arabic":"قَالُوا آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"122","text":"\"The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"","commentary":"Confirming their newfound faith, the sorcerers specified that the Lord they now believed in was the Lord of Prophet Moses and his brother Prophet Aaron. By identifying Allah with Moses and Aaron, they were not only acknowledging Allah's universal Lordship but also affirming the truthfulness of the message these prophets brought. This public declaration, coming from those who were meant to discredit Prophet Moses, served as a powerful testimony to the authenticity of his mission and the signs he presented. These verses (120-122) together represent a radical change of heart and allegiance driven by the clear evidence of Allah's power.","arabic":"رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ"},{"verse":"123","text":"Said Pharaoh: \"Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but soon shall ye know (the consequences).","commentary":"This verse follows immediately after the sorcerers, witnessing Prophet Moses's clear sign (his staff turning into a serpent), immediately believed and declared their faith in Allah, the Lord of Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh, seeing his own experts embrace the faith without his approval, reacts with anger and disbelief. He views their belief as an act of defiance and a pre-meditated plot against his authority and the Egyptian people, claiming they had planned this \"trick\" in the city to take control. His reaction highlights the nature of tyrannical power, which sees even inner spiritual conviction as a threat requiring permission, because it threatens the tyrant's claim to absolute control, even over people's beliefs and intentions.","arabic":"قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ آذَنَ لَكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَكَرْتُمُوهُ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ لِتُخْرِجُوا مِنْهَا أَهْلَهَا ۖ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"124","text":"\"Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross.\"","commentary":"Following his accusation in the previous verse that the sorcerers' belief was a plot against him, Pharaoh immediately issues a severe threat of punishment. He threatens them with torture (cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides) and execution by crucifixion. This shows the brutal response of a ruler whose authority is challenged not just physically, but by the emergence of faith in a higher power. The sudden and extreme nature of his threat underscores his fear that this new belief in Allah's sole authority could undermine his own power and control.","arabic":"لَأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِنْ خِلَافٍ ثُمَّ لَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"125","text":"They said: \"For us, We are but sent back unto our Lord:","commentary":"In the face of Pharaoh's terrifying threats of torture and death, the sorcerers who had just found faith respond calmly and with deep conviction. They simply state that their ultimate return is to their Lord, Allah. This response demonstrates the profound transformation faith brought to them. Worldly life and Pharaoh's power suddenly seemed insignificant compared to their certain return to Allah. This highlights how belief in the Hereafter and accountability to Allah can give believers immense strength and perspective, making them unafraid of earthly rulers or punishments.","arabic":"قَالُوا إِنَّا إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنْقَلِبُونَ"},{"verse":"126","text":"\"But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls unto thee as Muslims (who bow to thy will)!","commentary":"Continuing their response from the previous verse, the newly believing sorcerers confront Pharaoh directly, pointing out that the only reason for his wrath is their belief in the clear signs from Allah. They understand the core issue: their faith in Allah's sole authority is a direct challenge to Pharaoh's claimed authority. Recognizing the severity of the trial ahead, they turn to Allah, praying for steadfastness and patience in enduring the persecution. Their prayer to die as \"Muslims\" means they pray to remain in a state of submission to Allah's will until their last breath, demonstrating that their commitment to their faith is stronger than their fear of death or torture. This prayer for patience in adversity links directly to Prophet Moses's later counsel to his own people in Verse 128.","arabic":"وَمَا تَنْقِمُ مِنَّا إِلَّا أَنْ آمَنَّا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا لَمَّا جَاءَتْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَتَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ"},{"verse":"127","text":"Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people: \"Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?\" He said: \"Their male children will we slay; (only) their females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.\"","commentary":"After the surprising events with the sorcerers and their defiant stance against Pharaoh, the leaders of Pharaoh's people express their concern and advise him on how to deal with Prophet Moses and the Children of Israel. They frame the call to believe in Allah as \"spreading mischief\" or \"corruption\" in the land and a rejection of Pharaoh and the gods they worshipped. To them, challenging Pharaoh's authority by acknowledging Allah's sole sovereignty was the ultimate form of corruption. Pharaoh responds by reiterating a policy of brutal oppression against the Children of Israel, specifically threatening to kill their sons while letting the daughters live. This tactic is a means of weakening and controlling them, asserting his absolute power over their very lives, and continuing the persecution they had faced previously. This verse sets the stage for Prophet Moses's message of hope and reliance on Allah in the next verse.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْ قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُ لِيُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَآلِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِي نِسَاءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُونَ"},{"verse":"128","text":"Said Moses to his people: \"Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience and constancy: for the earth is Allah's, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous.","commentary":"Hearing about Pharaoh's renewed threats and the ongoing oppression (mentioned implicitly as the context for the discussion in Verse 127), Prophet Moses addresses his people, the Children of Israel. He doesn't focus on earthly strategies against Pharaoh but directs them towards spiritual strength and reliance on Allah. He advises them to seek Allah's help and to endure their suffering with patience and perseverance. He reminds them of a fundamental truth in Islam: the entire earth belongs to Allah. He grants its inheritance and authority to whichever of His servants He chooses, emphasizing that ultimate power and dominion are with Allah, not with rulers like Pharaoh. He gives them hope by assuring them that the final victory and a good end belong to those who are righteous and God-fearing. This counsel is a direct response to the fear and hardship discussed in the preceding verse and provides a framework for enduring oppression.","arabic":"قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ اسْتَعِينُوا بِاللَّهِ وَاصْبِرُوا ۖ إِنَّ الْأَرْضَ لِلَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"129","text":"They said: \"We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou camest to us.\" He said: \"It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds.\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Moses's encouragement to be patient and seek help from Allah in the previous verse, the Children of Israel respond with a complaint. They express their feeling of continuous hardship, stating that their suffering existed both before Prophet Moses's arrival and has persisted since. This shows their frustration and perhaps a lack of full understanding of the divine plan or the purpose of their trials. Prophet Moses responds by acknowledging their struggle but reiterates the possibility of Allah destroying their enemy (Pharaoh and his people) and granting them inheritance of the land, echoing the promise mentioned in the previous verse (128). Crucially, he adds a condition and a reminder: this potential inheritance is a test. Allah would then observe how they would behave and fulfill their responsibilities when given authority on earth. This links their current suffering to a future possibility of power, emphasizing that both states are forms of divine testing.","arabic":"قَالُوا أُوذِينَا مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَأْتِيَنَا وَمِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا ۚ قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"130","text":"We punished the people of Pharaoh with years (of droughts) and shortness of crops; that they might receive admonition.","commentary":"Moving from the dialogue between Prophet Moses and his people, the narrative shifts to Allah's direct action against Pharaoh and his people. As a consequence of their persistent rejection and oppression, Allah began to send punishments. This verse describes the initial affliction: years of drought and poor harvests. In a fertile land like Egypt, this would have been a significant and unusual hardship. The purpose of this punishment, as stated here, was for them to take heed, reflect, and perhaps turn away from their arrogant denial of Allah's signs and their oppression of the Children of Israel. This is presented as a clear sign from Allah, intended as a warning before more severe consequences.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ بِالسِّنِينَ وَنَقْصٍ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"131","text":"But when good (times) came, they said, \"This is due to us;\" When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah's sight, but most of them do not understand!","commentary":"This verse describes the reaction of Pharaoh's people to both ease and hardship, building on the previous verse which mentioned the drought and poor harvests. When prosperous times returned (after a period of difficulty, or perhaps in contrast to the hardship), they attributed it solely to themselves, claiming it was their right or achievement. However, when calamity struck again (like the drought in the previous verse or other troubles), they resorted to superstition. They blamed Prophet Moses and his followers, viewing them as the source of bad luck or \"evil omens.\" The verse refutes this superstitious belief, clarifying that the true source of ill fortune, in Allah's sight, is their own disbelief and wrongdoing, not Prophet Moses or the believers. Most of them, however, failed to grasp this reality, remaining blind to the spiritual connection between their actions and the consequences they faced.","arabic":"فَإِذَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْحَسَنَةُ قَالُوا لَنَا هَٰذِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَطَّيَّرُوا بِمُوسَىٰ وَمَنْ مَعَهُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"132","text":"They said (to Moses): \"Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee.","commentary":"This verse shows the hardened and defiant attitude of Pharaoh's people in response to the various signs and warnings they had been shown, including the drought and poor harvests mentioned in Verses 130 and 131. Despite witnessing these clear events which should have prompted reflection, they remained stubbornly dismissive. They declared to Prophet Moses that no matter what signs he brought, they would dismiss them as mere sorcery and would never believe in him. This highlights their deliberate rejection of the truth, choosing to attribute the miraculous signs to human trickery rather than acknowledging their divine origin. This closed-mindedness and insistence on disbelief sealed their fate and sets the stage for the more severe punishments that were to follow, as mentioned in the subsequent verses (which are outside the scope of this request).","arabic":"وَقَالُوا مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِنْ آيَةٍ لِتَسْحَرَنَا بِهَا فَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"133","text":"So We sent (plagues) on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,- a people given to sin.","commentary":"Continuing the account of Pharaoh and his people, this verse describes the consequences of their persistent refusal to believe in Allah and heed the clear signs brought by Prophet Moses. Despite experiencing earlier hardships like drought and poor harvests as warnings, they remained arrogant and given to sin. As a result, Allah sent further significant signs upon them: a plague of wholesale death (often interpreted as affecting their livestock and possibly people), invasions of locusts, lice, and frogs, and the water turning into blood. These were powerful, unmistakable signs intended to make them reflect and turn back to Allah.","arabic":"فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ آيَاتٍ مُفَصَّلَاتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُوا وَكَانُوا قَوْمًا مُجْرِمِينَ"},{"verse":"134","text":"Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: \"O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the penalty from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee.\"","commentary":"Following the description of the plagues in the previous verse, this verse highlights the reaction of Pharaoh and his people. Whenever one of these severe punishments afflicted them, they would turn to Prophet Moses, acknowledging his connection to his Lord, Allah. They would implore him to pray to Allah based on the special relationship and promises Allah had made to him, asking for the removal of the penalty. In exchange, they would promise two things: that they would genuinely believe in Prophet Moses and that they would finally allow the Children of Israel to leave Egypt with him. This shows their desperation during hardship and their understanding that the plagues were from a power beyond Pharaoh's control.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُوا يَا مُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِنْدَكَ ۖ لَئِنْ كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ"},{"verse":"135","text":"But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil,- Behold! they broke their word!","commentary":"This verse directly follows from the previous one, revealing the consequence of their promises made during the plagues. Each time Allah, in His wisdom, lifted the penalty from them, granting them relief for a predetermined period, they consistently failed to keep their word. They would revert to their previous state of disbelief, arrogance, and refusal to release the Children of Israel. This highlights their deep-seated defiance and unwillingness to change their ways, even after experiencing undeniable signs and making solemn vows.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ هُمْ بَالِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنْكُثُونَ"},{"verse":"136","text":"So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them.","commentary":"As a direct consequence of their repeated rejection of Allah's signs and their failure to honor their promises, as described in the preceding verses, this verse states that Allah's retribution finally befell Pharaoh and his people. This ultimate punishment was their drowning in the sea. This severe end was a result of their persistent denial of the clear signs sent to them through Prophet Moses and their refusal to learn from the numerous warnings and trials they had faced. It marks the decisive end of Pharaoh's tyranny.","arabic":"فَانْتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ فِي الْيَمِّ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُوا عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"137","text":"And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both east and west, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).","commentary":"Following the destruction of Pharaoh and his people by drowning in the previous verse, this verse describes the fate of the Children of Israel. They were a people who had been persecuted and considered weak and insignificant by Pharaoh's regime. However, Allah granted them inheritance of blessed lands in the east and west (often understood as parts of Palestine or the Levant). This was a fulfillment of Allah's gracious promise to them, which came about because they had shown patience and steadfastness during their severe trials and persecution. In stark contrast to their rise, this verse also notes that the impressive structures, great works, and buildings built by Pharaoh and his people out of pride were utterly destroyed, showing that worldly power built on tyranny is ultimately brought to ruin by Allah.","arabic":"وَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَارِقَ الْأَرْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا ۖ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَىٰ عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُوا ۖ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُوا يَعْرِشُونَ"},{"verse":"138","text":"We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: \"O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have.\" He said: \"Surely ye are a people without knowledge.","commentary":"After Allah saved the Children of Israel from Pharaoh and allowed them to cross the sea safely, they encountered a community who were worshipping idols. Despite having just witnessed Allah's immense power and their miraculous rescue, some among the Children of Israel asked Prophet Moses to create a deity for them to worship, similar to the idols of the people they saw. Prophet Moses responded, expressing his astonishment at their request and calling them ignorant for asking for such a thing after all they had experienced and been taught about worshipping Allah alone. This verse shows the immediate challenge faced by Prophet Moses in guiding his people towards pure monotheism, even after a clear sign of Allah's power. It sets the stage for the subsequent teachings and trials they would face.","arabic":"وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ الْبَحْرَ فَأَتَوْا عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَىٰ أَصْنَامٍ لَهُمْ ۚ قَالُوا يَا مُوسَى اجْعَلْ لَنَا إِلَٰهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ آلِهَةٌ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ"},{"verse":"139","text":"\"As to these folk,- the cult they are in is (but) a fragment of a ruin, and vain is the (worship) which they practise.\"","commentary":"Continuing his response from the previous verse, Prophet Moses explained to the Children of Israel the misguided nature of the people they had encountered who worshipped idols. He described the way of life and worship practiced by these idolaters as something that would inevitably lead to destruction and be ultimately worthless. He wanted his people to understand that seeking deities other than Allah was futile and had no lasting value or benefit, contrasting it with the truth of worshipping the One Allah who had just saved them.","arabic":"إِنَّ هَٰؤُلَاءِ مُتَبَّرٌ مَا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَاطِلٌ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"140","text":"He said: \"Shall I seek for you a god other than the (true) Allah, when it is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations?\"","commentary":"Building upon his previous points, Prophet Moses further emphasized the wrongness of their request by reminding them of Allah's immense favor upon them. He highlighted that Allah had chosen them and given them blessings, elevating them above many other people at that time, particularly by granting them salvation and sending a prophet and divine guidance. Asking him to seek a deity other than Allah, after receiving such grace, was a profound ingratitude and lack of understanding of who their true Lord was. This verse reinforces the message of Allah's uniqueness and the special relationship He had established with Prophet Moses and his people.","arabic":"قَالَ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَبْغِيكُمْ إِلَٰهًا وَهُوَ فَضَّلَكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"141","text":"And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord.","commentary":"This verse continues the reminder of Allah's favors upon the Children of Israel, echoing Prophet Moses's earlier words but now stated directly by Allah. It specifically recalls their suffering under Pharaoh's rule, detailing the severe oppression they faced, including the killing of their male infants. This painful experience, followed by their miraculous rescue, is described as a significant test from Allah. Remembering this past hardship and their salvation should have solidified their faith and gratitude, serving as a powerful lesson that only Allah could deliver them and was thus the only One worthy of worship. This serves as a context for the ongoing challenges they would face in maintaining their faith.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ ۖ يُقَتِّلُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلَاءٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"142","text":"We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): \"Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.\"","commentary":"This verse transitions to a new phase in the story. It describes how Allah set a specific time for Prophet Moses to come and communicate with Him, initially for thirty nights, which was later extended to forty nights. This period was for Prophet Moses to receive divine revelation and prepare for his mission. Before leaving his people for this spiritual retreat, Prophet Moses appointed his brother, Prophet Aaron, to lead them in his absence. He instructed Prophet Aaron to guide the people in righteousness and warned him not to follow the ways of those who cause corruption or mischief. This highlights the importance of leadership and maintaining guidance within the community, especially during the prophet's absence.","arabic":"وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ ثَلَاثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَاتُ رَبِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ۚ وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِأَخِيهِ هَارُونَ اخْلُفْنِي فِي قَوْمِي وَأَصْلِحْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"143","text":"When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: \"O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee.\" Allah said: \"By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.\" When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a unique and profound moment when Prophet Moses came to the appointed place and Allah spoke to him directly. Overwhelmed by this divine communication and his deep connection with Allah, Prophet Moses made the extraordinary request to see Allah. Allah informed him that he could not see Him directly in this earthly state but instructed him to look at a nearby mountain, stating that if the mountain remained in its place, then he might be able to see Him. When Allah manifested His glory upon the mountain, it instantly crumbled into dust, and Prophet Moses fell unconscious from the intensity of the experience. Upon regaining consciousness, Prophet Moses expressed Allah's perfection and glory, repented for his request (recognizing the limitation of his physical form to bear such a manifestation), and declared his profound belief. This event demonstrates Allah's majesty, the limitations of human perception, and Prophet Moses's deep devotion and humility.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنْظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَنْ تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي ۚ فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا ۚ فَلَمَّا أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"144","text":"(Allah) said: \"O Moses! I have chosen thee above (other) men, by the mission I (have given thee) and the words I (have spoken to thee): take then the (revelation) which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks.\"","commentary":"Following Prophet Moses's profound experience and declaration of repentance and faith, Allah affirmed His special favor upon him. Allah stated that He had chosen Prophet Moses above other men of his time, honoring him with prophethood and the unique privilege of speaking to Allah directly. Allah then instructed Prophet Moses to accept the divine revelation and laws that were being given to him and to be among those who are grateful for this immense favor and responsibility. This verse emphasizes the honor bestowed upon Prophet Moses and the importance of receiving and appreciating divine guidance. It directly leads into the next verse where the contents of this revelation are mentioned.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنِّي اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَالَاتِي وَبِكَلَامِي فَخُذْ مَا آتَيْتُكَ وَكُنْ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"145","text":"And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, (and said): \"Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked,- (How they lie desolate).\"","commentary":"Following the confirmation of his prophethood and the command to be grateful, this verse describes the specific divine guidance given to Prophet Moses: the Tablets containing laws and detailed explanations for his people. These Tablets contained comprehensive guidance covering various aspects of life. Allah instructed Prophet Moses to receive these laws with strength and determination and to command his people to adhere strictly to the best aspects of these divine instructions. As a consequence of following this guidance, Allah promised to show them the fate and desolate homes of those who were wicked or disobedient, implying victory and inheritance of the land. This highlights the importance of taking divine law seriously and the blessings that come from adhering to it, setting a contrast with the fate of the disobedient described in the following verses.","arabic":"وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِي الْأَلْوَاحِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مَوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلًا لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُوا بِأَحْسَنِهَا ۚ سَأُرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"146","text":"Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them.","commentary":"This verse describes the nature and consequence for people who act arrogantly on earth and deliberately turn away from what is right, contrasting sharply with the call to follow divine guidance with seriousness mentioned in the previous verse. Allah states that He will turn such people away from understanding and benefiting from His signs, whether these are signs in the universe or the revelations sent down. Even if they witness clear evidence, their arrogance and rejection of truth prevent them from believing. They are described as those who actively choose the path of error when they see it, while shunning the path of righteousness, because they have knowingly rejected Allah's messages and warnings. This highlights that their fate is a consequence of their own deliberate choice and attitude.","arabic":"سَأَصْرِفُ عَنْ آيَاتِيَ الَّذِينَ يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَإِنْ يَرَوْا كُلَّ آيَةٍ لَا يُؤْمِنُوا بِهَا وَإِنْ يَرَوْا سَبِيلَ الرُّشْدِ لَا يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا وَإِنْ يَرَوْا سَبِيلَ الْغَيِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُوا عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"147","text":"Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter,- vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought?","commentary":"This verse concludes the description of those who reject Allah's signs and guidance, particularly focusing on their denial of accountability in the afterlife. It states that the actions and efforts of such people are ultimately futile and worthless in the grand scheme of things. Since they deny the reality of standing before Allah for judgment, their deeds, no matter how they appear in this life, will not bring them any reward in the Hereafter. They will only face the consequences that their own rejection and actions have earned for them. This serves as a strong warning about the importance of faith in Allah's signs and the Hereafter, linking actions in this world to their ultimate outcome and serving as a stark contrast to the promise of reward for those who follow divine guidance mentioned earlier (Verse 145).","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَلِقَاءِ الْآخِرَةِ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ ۚ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"148","text":"The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of calf, (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong.","commentary":"This verse describes a significant deviation by the people of Prophet Moses while he was away meeting with Allah. Despite being recently saved from oppression and witnessing miracles, they used their gold ornaments to fashion a calf statue for worship. This act is presented as profoundly misguided; the calf was a lifeless object that could not speak or guide them. This highlights how quickly they turned away from the clear message of worshipping Allah alone, illustrating a lapse into ignorance and misguidance after a period of struggle under tyranny.","arabic":"وَاتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَهُ خُوَارٌ ۚ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ وَلَا يَهْدِيهِمْ سَبِيلًا ۘ اتَّخَذُوهُ وَكَانُوا ظَالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"149","text":"When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: \"If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who perish.\"","commentary":"Following their act of worshipping the calf, this verse shows a moment of realization and remorse among the people. They understood the severity of their error and felt deep regret. Their words reveal a recognition of their vulnerability and their sole reliance on Allah's mercy and forgiveness to escape destruction. This verse indicates that despite their grave mistake, some among them still held a possibility of turning back to the right path by acknowledging their wrongdoing and seeking divine pardon. It follows the previous verse by showing the immediate consequence of their realization.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا سُقِطَ فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ وَرَأَوْا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ ضَلُّوا قَالُوا لَئِنْ لَمْ يَرْحَمْنَا رَبُّنَا وَيَغْفِرْ لَنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"150","text":"When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: \"Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?\" He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: \"Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.\"","commentary":"Returning from his meeting with Allah, Prophet Moses was understandably filled with intense anger and sorrow upon witnessing his people's idolatry. He immediately rebuked them for their terrible act in his absence, questioning if they were rushing towards Allah's judgment. His extreme reaction is shown physically; he put down the sacred tablets containing Allah's law and, in his distress, confronted his brother Prophet Aaron, who had been left in charge. Prophet Aaron defended himself, appealing to their familial bond and explaining that the people had overwhelmed him, disregarded his authority, and even threatened his life when he tried to stop them, pleading not to be counted among the wrongdoers. This verse vividly portrays the shock and emotional turmoil caused by the people's deviation and Prophet Aaron's difficult position. It flows directly from the previous verses by depicting the scene upon Prophet Moses's return.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَانَ أَسِفًا قَالَ بِئْسَمَا خَلَفْتُمُونِي مِنْ بَعْدِي ۖ أَعَجِلْتُمْ أَمْرَ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ وَأَلْقَى الْأَلْوَاحَ وَأَخَذَ بِرَأْسِ أَخِيهِ يَجُرُّهُ إِلَيْهِ ۚ قَالَ ابْنَ أُمَّ إِنَّ الْقَوْمَ اسْتَضْعَفُونِي وَكَادُوا يَقْتُلُونَنِي فَلَا تُشْمِتْ بِيَ الْأَعْدَاءَ وَلَا تَجْعَلْنِي مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"151","text":"Moses prayed: \"O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!\"","commentary":"After the heated confrontation with his brother Prophet Aaron and seeing the depth of his people's error, Prophet Moses's intense anger began to subside. He turned immediately to Allah in prayer, seeking forgiveness for himself and his brother. This prayer, following Prophet Aaron's defense and explanation, shows Prophet Moses's renewed focus on Allah and his recognition of their collective need for divine mercy. It highlights his leadership in seeking Allah's pardon and emphasizes the profound attribute of Allah as the Most Merciful, providing a path to reconciliation after such a severe transgression by his people. This verse follows the intense scene of confrontation by showing Prophet Moses's recourse to prayer.","arabic":"قَالَ رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَلِأَخِي وَأَدْخِلْنَا فِي رَحْمَتِكَ ۖ وَأَنْتَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ"},{"verse":"152","text":"Those who took the calf (for worship) will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent (falsehoods).","commentary":"This verse presents Allah's judgment regarding those who persisted in worshipping the calf. It states that they would face divine wrath and experience shame in this worldly life. This is presented as a just consequence for those who deliberately create falsehoods against Allah, which includes fabricating idols and attributing divinity to them. This verse underscores the severity of their sin and the certain retribution that follows such acts of misguidance and invention of falsehoods. It serves as a stern warning and an explanation of the consequence of their actions described in earlier verses.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا الْعِجْلَ سَيَنَالُهُمْ غَضَبٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَذِلَّةٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُفْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"153","text":"But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and (truly) believe,- verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"In contrast to the fate of the unrepentant calf worshippers mentioned in the previous verse, this verse offers hope and emphasizes Allah's boundless forgiveness and mercy. It states that for anyone who commits wrongdoing but sincerely repents afterwards and holds true faith, Allah is immensely forgiving and merciful. This verse establishes a universal principle that the door to divine mercy remains open for those who turn back to Allah with sincerity after falling into error. It beautifully balances the stern warning in the preceding verse with the comforting promise of forgiveness for the repentant believer.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ عَمِلُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ ثُمَّ تَابُوا مِنْ بَعْدِهَا وَآمَنُوا إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِنْ بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"154","text":"When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord.","commentary":"Following the resolution of the crisis and the seeking of forgiveness, this verse describes Prophet Moses recovering from his intense anger. He picked up the tablets containing Allah's divine law, which he had set down in his distress. The verse specifically highlights the nature of the inscriptions on these tablets: they were a source of guidance and mercy. This guidance and mercy were particularly beneficial for those who held a reverent awe (fear) of their Lord, indicating that a receptive heart is essential to benefit from divine revelation. This act signifies a return to the foundational divine message after the turmoil caused by the people's misstep. It shows Prophet Moses resuming his role and emphasizing the importance of adhering to Allah's law.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ عَنْ مُوسَى الْغَضَبُ أَخَذَ الْأَلْوَاحَ ۖ وَفِي نُسْخَتِهَا هُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِرَبِّهِمْ يَرْهَبُونَ"},{"verse":"155","text":"And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: \"O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive.","commentary":"Moving forward in the narrative, Prophet Moses selected seventy distinguished men from his people for a specific meeting appointed by Allah. During this event, they were overcome by a violent trembling. In response to this crisis, Prophet Moses turned to Allah in earnest prayer. He expressed profound submission to Allah's will, acknowledging that Allah could have destroyed them all long ago if He had willed. He pleaded that they not be destroyed for the actions of the foolish or weak-minded among them. Recognizing the event as a divine test, he acknowledged Allah's power to guide or allow others to stray according to His will. He then passionately sought Allah's forgiveness and mercy, affirming Allah as their Protector and the best source of forgiveness. This verse illustrates Prophet Moses's intercessory role and his deep understanding of Allah's power and the nature of divine trials.","arabic":"وَاخْتَارَ مُوسَىٰ قَوْمَهُ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلًا لِمِيقَاتِنَا ۖ فَلَمَّا أَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّجْفَةُ قَالَ رَبِّ لَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكْتَهُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَإِيَّايَ ۖ أَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ السُّفَهَاءُ مِنَّا ۖ إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا فِتْنَتُكَ تُضِلُّ بِهَا مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَاءُ ۖ أَنْتَ وَلِيُّنَا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا ۖ وَأَنْتَ خَيْرُ الْغَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"156","text":"\"And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee.\" He said: \"With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and practise regular charity, and those who believe in Our signs;-","commentary":"Prophet Moses's prayer continues in this verse, asking Allah to grant them goodness both in this world and the hereafter, emphasizing their return and reliance on Him. Allah's response clarifies His absolute authority: He brings punishment upon whomever He wills, but stresses that His mercy is vast and encompasses everything. However, this immense mercy is specifically designated and granted to those who fulfill certain conditions. Allah lists these conditions: those who act righteously, give in charity, and believe in His signs. This sets the stage for the following verse by defining the qualities of those who are destined to receive Allah's special mercy.","arabic":"وَاكْتُبْ لَنَا فِي هَٰذِهِ الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ إِنَّا هُدْنَا إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ عَذَابِي أُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ ۖ وَرَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ ۚ فَسَأَكْتُبُهَا لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ بِآيَاتِنَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"157","text":"\"Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own (scriptures),- in the law and the Gospel;- for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honour him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him,- it is they who will prosper.\"","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's definition of those who receive Allah's special mercy, this verse provides a pivotal description of a key characteristic of such people: they are those who follow a specific messenger. This messenger is identified as the unlettered Prophet (Prophet Muhammad), whose coming was foretold in earlier scriptures like the Torah and the Gospel that were with the Children of Israel. The verse outlines his key characteristics and mission: he commands justice, forbids evil, permits good things, and prohibits impure things. Significantly, it states that he will lift heavy burdens and yokes from those who follow him, implying certain hardships or restrictions from previous laws. The verse concludes by stating that true success belongs to those who believe in, honor, support, and follow the divine guidance (the Qur'an) sent down with this Prophet. This verse serves as a bridge, connecting the narrative of Prophet Moses and the Children of Israel to the final prophecy in Islam, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and following the Prophet Muhammad for true guidance and success.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِيَّ الْأُمِّيَّ الَّذِي يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عِنْدَهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنْجِيلِ يَأْمُرُهُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَاهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالْأَغْلَالَ الَّتِي كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ فَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِهِ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ وَاتَّبَعُوا النُّورَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ مَعَهُ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"158","text":"Say: \"O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in Allah and His words: follow him that (so) ye may be guided.\"","commentary":"This verse introduces Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) addressing all humanity, declaring that he is Allah's Messenger to everyone. Unlike previous prophets who were often sent to specific communities or for particular times, this message is universal and final. He emphasizes that the One sending him is Allah, the Sovereign Ruler of the heavens and the earth, the only true deity, Who alone has power over life and death. Therefore, the call is to believe in Allah, with these supreme attributes, and to believe in His Messenger, the Prophet Muhammad, described as the \"unlettered Prophet.\" This description highlights his authenticity, as his profound knowledge and wisdom came from divine revelation, not conventional schooling. He himself believes firmly in Allah and His messages. The verse concludes by stating that following this Prophet is the path to guidance. This connects to the broader theme of the Sura, which emphasizes guidance through Allah's messengers and revelations, contrasting it with deviation.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"159","text":"Of the people of Moses there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth.","commentary":"Following the universal call to faith in the previous verse, this verse shifts focus back to the Children of Israel, descendants of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). It serves as a reminder and an acknowledgment that within their history, not all were disobedient or deviated from the truth. There was always a group among them who adhered to Allah's guidance, judged fairly according to the truth revealed to Prophet Moses, and sought to guide others rightly. This highlights that guidance and righteousness are possible within any community and are rewarded by Allah, providing a contrast to the descriptions of disobedience that follow.","arabic":"وَمِنْ قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ"},{"verse":"160","text":"We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: \"Strike the rock with thy staff\": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you\": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.","commentary":"This verse recounts some of the many blessings Allah bestowed upon the Children of Israel after they were saved from Pharaoh. It continues the narrative flow by illustrating Allah's care and provision despite their earlier struggles with faith. They were organized into twelve tribes, based on their ancestry, and Allah provided for their basic needs in the desert: water gushing from a rock when Prophet Moses struck it (resulting in twelve springs, one for each tribe, preventing conflict over resources), shade from clouds, and nourishing food (manna and quails). These were miraculous provisions, yet, despite these clear signs of divine favor, the verse notes that they \"rebelled\" and harmed themselves through their actions. This sets the stage for the consequences of disobedience described in the following verses.","arabic":"وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمُ اثْنَتَيْ عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا أُمَمًا ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ إِذِ اسْتَسْقَاهُ قَوْمُهُ أَنِ اضْرِبْ بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ ۖ فَانْبَجَسَتْ مِنْهُ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا ۖ قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَشْرَبَهُمْ ۚ وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الْغَمَامَ وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَنَّ وَالسَّلْوَىٰ ۖ كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ ۚ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"161","text":"And remember it was said to them: \"Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good.\"","commentary":"This verse describes another command given to the Children of Israel as they were about to enter a town. They were instructed to enter the town with humility, expressing a specific phrase seeking Allah's forgiveness (\"say the word of humility\") and showing physical reverence by entering the gate in a humble posture. This command was a test of their obedience and gratitude for the blessings and the opportunity to settle in a place with abundant provisions (\"eat therein as ye wish\"). In return for their obedience and humility, Allah promised to forgive their wrongdoings and increase the reward for those who did good deeds. This highlights the connection between humility, obedience, seeking forgiveness, and receiving Allah's blessings, linking it to the actions and consequences discussed previously.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمُ اسْكُنُوا هَٰذِهِ الْقَرْيَةَ وَكُلُوا مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ وَقُولُوا حِطَّةٌ وَادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطِيئَاتِكُمْ ۚ سَنَزِيدُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"162","text":"But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed.","commentary":"Picking up from the previous verse's command to enter the town with humility, this verse explains what happened next. The \"transgressors\" among the Children of Israel disobeyed the specific instructions given to them. They altered the phrase they were commanded to say, often interpreted as mocking the command, and likely failed to enter with the required humble posture. Because of this deliberate disobedience and their \"repeated transgression,\" Allah sent a severe punishment upon them from the sky, often described as a plague. This illustrates the consequence of altering or disregarding divine commands, particularly when given clear instructions and promises of reward for obedience. It directly contrasts with the reward promised in the previous verse, showing the immediate consequence of transgression.","arabic":"فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ قَوْلًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِجْزًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"163","text":"Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.","commentary":"Moving to another historical event, this verse instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to question the Children of Israel (specifically those addressed in Medina) about a particular coastal town and its inhabitants who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath (their designated day of rest and worship). Allah tested them by making fish easily accessible near the shore only on the Sabbath day, while they were absent on other days. This presented a strong temptation, testing their commitment to Allah's command to refrain from work on that day. The verse explicitly states this was a \"trial\" for them because of their inclination towards transgression. This serves as another example, continuing the theme, of the Children of Israel being tested by Allah's commands and provisions, and their tendency towards disobedience.","arabic":"وَاسْأَلْهُمْ عَنِ الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِي كَانَتْ حَاضِرَةَ الْبَحْرِ إِذْ يَعْدُونَ فِي السَّبْتِ إِذْ تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ يَوْمَ سَبْتِهِمْ شُرَّعًا وَيَوْمَ لَا يَسْبِتُونَ ۙ لَا تَأْتِيهِمْ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَبْلُوهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"164","text":"When some of them said: \"Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?\"- said the preachers:\" To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him.\"","commentary":"Within the town mentioned in the previous verse, there were different groups of people. This verse captures a dialogue between two groups: those who were openly transgressing by violating the Sabbath, and a group who were warning them against their actions. A third group (mentioned in commentary but not explicitly detailed in this verse) questioned the actions of the preachers, arguing that since Allah was surely going to punish the transgressors anyway, preaching to them was pointless. The preachers responded that they were fulfilling their obligation to Allah by enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. They also held onto the hope that perhaps their efforts might still cause the transgressors to fear Allah and repent. This verse highlights the importance of calling others to righteousness, even in seemingly hopeless situations, as a duty to Allah and a means of potentially inspiring positive change.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَتْ أُمَّةٌ مِنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمًا ۙ اللَّهُ مُهْلِكُهُمْ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۖ قَالُوا مَعْذِرَةً إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"165","text":"When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.","commentary":"This verse describes the outcome of the situation presented in the previous two verses concerning the Sabbath breakers. Since the transgressors ignored the warnings and persisted in their disobedience, Allah's judgment came upon them. Allah rescued the group who had actively warned against the evil deeds. However, the group of wrongdoers who violated the Sabbath were afflicted with a severe punishment because of their persistent transgression. This reinforces the principle that calling others to accountability is important, and that those who choose to disobey divine commands, especially after being warned, will face consequences, while those who strive for righteousness are saved.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا نَسُوا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ أَنْجَيْنَا الَّذِينَ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ السُّوءِ وَأَخَذْنَا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا بِعَذَابٍ بَئِيسٍ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"166","text":"When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\"","commentary":"This verse details the specific severe punishment that befell the transgressors from the previous verse. Due to their persistent insolence and complete disregard for the prohibitions, Allah changed their form. They were transformed into \"apes, despised and rejected.\" This was a physical manifestation of their spiritual degradation, as their actions showed a lack of human will and reason in submitting to divine commands, instead following base desires. This transformation was a direct result of their defiance and serves as a powerful illustration of the consequences of turning away from Allah's guidance in an arrogant manner.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا عَتَوْا عَنْ مَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ قُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ"},{"verse":"167","text":"Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the description of the immediate punishment for the Sabbath breakers, this verse reveals a long-term consequence declared by Allah for the Children of Israel as a whole due to their repeated history of disobedience and breaking covenants. Allah declared that He would continuously raise people against them who would inflict severe hardship upon them until the Day of Judgment. This is presented as a consequence of their actions throughout history. The verse concludes by emphasizing two of Allah's attributes: He is swift in bringing retribution upon those who deserve it, but He is also immensely forgiving and merciful towards those who turn to Him in sincere repentance. This provides a balance, showing that while punishment is a reality for transgression, the door of mercy is always open.","arabic":"وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ يَسُومُهُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ ۖ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"168","text":"We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to us).","commentary":"Following events in their history, Allah informs us that He dispersed the Children of Israel across the earth, dividing them into different groups. Among these groups were people who were genuinely devoted to doing good and upholding truth, and others who were far from that path. Allah tested them through both times of ease and comfort (prosperity) and times of difficulty and hardship (adversity). These tests were designed as opportunities for them to reflect, remember their covenant with Allah, and turn back to Him in repentance and obedience. This verse sets the stage by describing the varied state of the Israelite community after Prophet Moses' time.","arabic":"وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ أُمَمًا ۖ مِنْهُمُ الصَّالِحُونَ وَمِنْهُمْ دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ وَبَلَوْنَاهُمْ بِالْحَسَنَاتِ وَالسَّيِّئَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"169","text":"After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse): \"(Everything) will be forgiven us.\" (Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand?","commentary":"This verse speaks about later generations of the Children of Israel who came after the time of Prophet Moses. They received and studied the divine Scripture (the Book), but instead of living by its guidance, they prioritized the temporary pleasures and attractions of this world. They would indulge in forbidden things, excusing themselves by saying that Allah would forgive them anyway. This desire for worldly gain was so strong that if another opportunity for illicit pleasure arose, they would eagerly take it again. Allah questions them: Didn't they take a solemn pledge in their Scripture to only speak the truth about Allah? They had studied the Book and knew what was right, yet they made false claims about forgiveness to justify their actions. The verse contrasts this behavior with the reward in the Hereafter, which is far better for those who truly strive to please Allah and live righteously. It challenges them, and us, to use our minds and understand this fundamental truth.","arabic":"فَخَلَفَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ وَرِثُوا الْكِتَابَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَٰذَا الْأَدْنَىٰ وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِنْ يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مِثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ ۚ أَلَمْ يُؤْخَذْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَنْ لَا يَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ وَدَرَسُوا مَا فِيهِ ۗ وَالدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ ۗ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"170","text":"As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer,- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.","commentary":"In contrast to the previous verse, which described those who inherited the Book but neglected its teachings for worldly gain, this verse highlights the reward for those who *do* sincerely follow the divine path. It speaks of people from the Children of Israel, and by extension, all believers, who firmly adhere to the Scripture and diligently perform their prayers and acts of worship. These are the ones who strive to do what is right. Allah gives His assurance that He will never let the reward of such righteous individuals be lost or diminished. This verse serves as both a promise for the sincere and an implicit contrast to the misguided actions described earlier, emphasizing that true benefit comes from living according to Allah's guidance.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُمَسِّكُونَ بِالْكِتَابِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُصْلِحِينَ"},{"verse":"171","text":"When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah.\"","commentary":"This verse recalls a significant event from the time of Prophet Moses and the Children of Israel. At a moment when they were hesitant or unwilling to accept the divine covenant and the responsibilities given in the Scripture, Allah caused Mount Sinai to be suspended over them like a looming shadow, making them fear it would fall. In that awe-inspiring moment, Allah commanded them to hold firmly to the Scripture He had given them and to constantly remember its contents. This dramatic event underscored the immense seriousness and importance of the divine message and the covenant they were taking. It was a powerful reminder designed to instill a sense of reverence and consciousness of Allah in their hearts, encouraging them to adhere to His commands and avoid disobedience. This historical incident is presented here to emphasize the weight and obligation associated with receiving and holding onto Allah's divine revelation, connecting back to the importance of holding fast to the Book mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَإِذْ نَتَقْنَا الْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُوا مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"172","text":"When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): \"Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)?\"- They said: \"Yea! We do testify!\" (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: \"Of this we were never mindful\":","commentary":"This verse describes a profound event or inherent truth about human nature. From a Muslim perspective, it speaks of a time when Allah (God) gathered all of humanity, all the descendants yet to be born from Adam's lineage, while they were still contained within their ancestors. At this point, Allah addressed them, asking, \"Am I not your Lord?\" And all of humanity, in their primordial state, acknowledged and testified, \"Yes, we do testify!\" This moment, whether understood as a literal gathering or a symbolic representation of an innate human inclination, establishes a fundamental covenant. It means that every human being is born with an intrinsic awareness or recognition of Allah as their Creator and Sustainer. This serves as a basis so that on the Day of Judgment, no one can claim they were unaware of their Lord.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ ۖ قَالُوا بَلَىٰ ۛ شَهِدْنَا ۛ أَنْ تَقُولُوا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هَٰذَا غَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"173","text":"Or lest ye should say: \"Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are (their) descendants after them: wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile?\"","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this verse explains another reason why the primordial testimony is significant. Because human beings made this fundamental acknowledgment of Allah as their Lord, they cannot later excuse themselves on the Day of Judgment by saying that they merely followed the misguided ways of their ancestors who worshipped false deities. The inherent recognition of Allah instilled in their nature means they have a personal responsibility. While acknowledging their lineage, they cannot use their forefathers' errors as a sole justification for their own actions or a plea against accountability. These verses highlight that the acknowledgment of Allah is deeply rooted in every individual, predating external influences like family traditions.","arabic":"أَوْ تَقُولُوا إِنَّمَا أَشْرَكَ آبَاؤُنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا ذُرِّيَّةً مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ۖ أَفَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ"},{"verse":"174","text":"Thus do We explain the signs in detail; and perchance they may turn (unto Us).","commentary":"Following the explanation of the primordial covenant and the personal responsibility it entails, this verse emphasizes Allah's grace and clear communication. It states that Allah explains His \"signs\"—His verses, messages, and the evidence of His existence and power in the universe—in detail. This is done so that people may \"turn\" or return to Him. This turning is a return to their original, pure nature that recognized Allah as their Lord (as described in Verse 172). While the innate recognition exists, external factors can cause people to deviate. Therefore, Allah sends clear signs and messages, like the Qur'an, and messengers to remind and guide humanity back to the straight path and fulfill the primordial covenant. This verse connects the innate human nature to the need for divine guidance and reminders.","arabic":"وَكَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"175","text":"Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray.","commentary":"Moving from the general principle of innate recognition and divine signs, this verse introduces a specific example of someone who received divine \"signs\"—knowledge and guidance from Allah—but chose to disregard them. The Arabic phrasing suggests he actively cast them off, as if removing something important. Because he rejected the guidance, he became vulnerable, and this vulnerability allowed Satan to pursue him and lead him astray. This story serves as a warning about the consequence of ignoring divine guidance, showing that possessing knowledge is not enough; one must actively embrace and follow it to remain on the right path and avoid falling under the influence of evil.","arabic":"وَاتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ الَّذِي آتَيْنَاهُ آيَاتِنَا فَانْسَلَخَ مِنْهَا فَأَتْبَعَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْغَاوِينَ"},{"verse":"176","text":"If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; So relate the story; perchance they may reflect.","commentary":"This verse continues the story from Verse 175, illustrating the miserable state of the person who rejected divine signs. It explains that Allah could have elevated him due to the knowledge he possessed, but he chose instead to cling to worldly life (\"inclined to the earth\") and prioritize his own fleeting desires. His state is then compared to a panting dog, which constantly lolls its tongue out, whether under duress or left alone. This powerful image depicts a state of perpetual, unsatisfied craving or agitation, perhaps linked to his relentless pursuit of worldly things after abandoning spiritual elevation. The verse then explicitly states this is the likeness of those who reject Allah's signs. The instruction to tell this story is given so that others may reflect on the negative consequences of turning away from divine guidance and succumbing to worldly desires.","arabic":"وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَرَفَعْنَاهُ بِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ ۚ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ الْكَلْبِ إِنْ تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَثْ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا ۚ فَاقْصُصِ الْقَصَصَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"177","text":"Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls.","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding comment on the example given in the preceding two verses (175-176). It emphatically states that those who reject Allah's signs present a terrible example. Furthermore, it clarifies that by doing so, they are not harming Allah but are fundamentally \"wronging their own souls.\" They are depriving themselves of guidance, lowering their human dignity (as illustrated by the comparison to a dog in Verse 176), and inviting negative consequences upon themselves in this life and the hereafter. This underscores the personal accountability mentioned earlier (Verses 172-173) and highlights the self-destructive nature of rejecting divine truth after it has been presented.","arabic":"سَاءَ مَثَلًا الْقَوْمُ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَأَنْفُسَهُمْ كَانُوا يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"178","text":"Whom Allah doth guide,- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance,- such are the persons who perish.","commentary":"Following the example of someone who went astray, this verse states a fundamental principle regarding guidance. It explains that true guidance comes from Allah. Whoever Allah guides is indeed on the right path, leading to success and ultimate well-being. Conversely, those whom Allah \"rejects from His guidance\"—meaning those who, by their own choice to ignore His signs and messages, are left to stray—are the ones who ultimately \"perish\" or are losers. This doesn't mean Allah arbitrarily withholds guidance; rather, it aligns with the principle that Allah guides those who seek guidance and turn towards Him, and leaves astray those who deliberately turn away and close their hearts and minds, as suggested by the earlier verses.","arabic":"مَنْ يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِي ۖ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلْ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"179","text":"Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle,- nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning).","commentary":"This verse describes the characteristics of many of the jinn and human beings who are destined for Hell. It explains they have faculties of understanding (hearts/minds), sight (eyes), and hearing (ears), but they fail to use these faculties to grasp the truth, see the signs around them, or hear the divine messages. Because they possess these abilities but choose not to use them for guidance, they are described as being like cattle, who are led by instinct alone. However, the verse states they are even \"more misguided\" than cattle because they were given the potential for higher understanding and failed to utilize it, remaining \"heedless\" of warnings and signs. This is not arbitrary condemnation but a description of the state of those who willfully reject guidance despite having the means to perceive it, connecting back to the idea of personal choice and accountability.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ ۖ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ"},{"verse":"180","text":"The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in his names: for what they do, they will soon be requited.","commentary":"This verse instructs believers on how to relate to Allah and those who misuse His names or attributes. It emphasizes that Allah possesses the most beautiful and perfect names, reflecting His unique attributes and majesty. Believers are encouraged to call upon Allah using these names, which helps in understanding His nature and strengthening one's connection with Him. The verse also warns against associating with those who use \"profanity\" or distort Allah's names. This includes misusing His names, attributing His unique qualities to others, or having twisted concepts about Him. Such actions are a serious deviation from the pure belief in Allah's oneness. The verse concludes with a warning that those who do this will face consequences for their actions.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَائِهِ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"181","text":"Of those We have created are people who direct (others) with truth. And dispense justice therewith.","commentary":"In contrast to the descriptions of those who reject signs and are heedless, this verse highlights the existence of a community among Allah's creation who uphold and promote the truth. It describes them as people who \"direct others with truth,\" meaning they call others to the truth and guide them towards it. Furthermore, they \"dispense justice therewith,\" which means they implement the truth in their lives and societies, using it as the standard for fairness and right conduct. This indicates that divine truth is not just a set of beliefs but a practical guide for establishing justice and order in human life. This group represents those who fulfill the covenant mentioned in the earlier verses, embracing and applying the divine guidance they receive.","arabic":"وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ"},{"verse":"182","text":"Those who reject Our signs, We shall gradually visit with punishment, in ways they perceive not;","commentary":"This verse speaks about the consequence for those who consciously choose to reject the clear signs from Allah that point towards truth and guidance. It explains that Allah will bring punishment upon them gradually, in subtle ways that they may not even recognize are punishments. These consequences unfold step by step, often starting in this life, in ways that are not immediately obvious to the person experiencing them. This serves as a warning that rejecting truth has subtle, unfolding consequences directed by Allah's plan.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُمْ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"183","text":"Respite will I grant unto them: for My scheme is strong (and unfailing).","commentary":"Following the previous verse, this verse explains that Allah grants a period of respite or delay to those who reject His signs. They are given time, and their punishment is not immediate. However, this delay does not mean they are forgotten or that their rejection is without consequence. The verse emphasizes that Allah's plan or \"scheme\" is strong and unfailing. This means that the gradual unfolding of consequences mentioned in the previous verse is part of a sure and inevitable divine plan that will ultimately reach them. The delay is a grace period, not a sign of weakness or oversight from Allah.","arabic":"وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ"},{"verse":"184","text":"Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness: he is but a perspicuous warner.","commentary":"This verse prompts reflection, particularly addressing those who might dismiss or accuse Prophet Muhammad of being mad, as some did during his time. It asks people to think about the Prophet, their \"companion,\" whom they had known for a long time. It challenges the accusation of madness by pointing out his character and actions, which were clearly not those of someone afflicted with madness. Instead, it states plainly that he is a clear and insightful \"warner,\" someone sent to alert people to the truth and the consequences of rejecting it. This verse connects to the previous ones by highlighting the nature of the messenger who brings the signs and warnings that are being rejected, urging people to consider the source of the message.","arabic":"أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُوا ۗ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِمْ مِنْ جِنَّةٍ ۚ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"185","text":"Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created? (Do they not see) that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end? In what message after this will they then believe?","commentary":"Continuing the call to reflection from the previous verse, this verse directs people's attention outward, to the vast universe. It asks them to observe and contemplate the order and creation within the heavens and the earth and everything Allah has created. The intricate design, balance, and coherence of the universe are presented as clear signs of the Creator's existence and power. The verse then brings this reflection back to their own existence, prompting them to consider that their life span or \"term\" on Earth might be nearing its end. It challenges them to think about the finality of the message being delivered – if they do not believe in this clear message and the signs around them now, what future message could possibly convince them?","arabic":"أَوَلَمْ يَنْظُرُوا فِي مَلَكُوتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِنْ شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىٰ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدِ اقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ ۖ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"186","text":"To such as Allah rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction.","commentary":"This verse states a divine principle regarding guidance and error. It explains that for those whom Allah allows to go astray, there will be no guide. This isn't a matter of arbitrary withholding, but reflects Allah's law based on people's choices. As discussed in the broader commentary, individuals are created with the capacity to recognize truth and are given clear signs and messengers. If, despite this, they choose to turn away from guidance and close their hearts and minds, Allah, in accordance with His law, leaves them in their state of willful ignorance or \"trespasses.\" As a result, they stumble along blindly, lost in confusion and distraction, unable to find the right path because they have rejected the means provided for guidance. This follows the previous verse which highlighted the clear signs available but asks who will believe if they reject this message.","arabic":"مَنْ يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَا هَادِيَ لَهُ ۚ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"187","text":"They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time?

Only, all of a sudden will it come to you.\" They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof: Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone), but most men know not.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses questions posed to Prophet Muhammad about the timing of the \"Hour,\" or the Day of Resurrection. It explains that people asked him when it would happen, perhaps mockingly or to test him. The response the Prophet is instructed to give is clear: knowledge of the exact time is exclusively with Allah. No one else, not even the Prophet, has this knowledge. It emphasizes the immense impact and significance of this event, describing its \"burden\" as heavy upon the heavens and the earth. Furthermore, it states that it will come suddenly and unexpectedly. The verse notes their persistent questioning, as if the Prophet himself were desperately seeking this knowledge, and reiterates that its knowledge rests with Allah alone, a truth that most people do not grasp. This links back to the previous verses by presenting the reality of a future reckoning that people should be prepared for, rather than focusing on its unknown timing.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي ۖ لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَا إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ ثَقُلَتْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً ۗ يَسْأَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِيٌّ عَنْهَا ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"188","text":"Say: \"I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as Allah willeth. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith.\"","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, which established that knowledge of the Hour is solely with Allah, this verse further clarifies the human limitations of Prophet Muhammad, despite his high status. He is commanded to declare that he has no inherent power to bring himself benefit or avert harm, except according to Allah's will. If he possessed knowledge of the unseen realm (which includes things like the timing of the Hour and the consequences of actions), he states he would have secured every benefit and avoided every harm. This demonstrates that even a prophet does not possess divine attributes. His role is clearly defined: he is only a \"warner\" about consequences and a \"bringer of glad tidings\" (good news) to those who believe, guiding them towards what is good and warning them against evil.","arabic":"قُلْ لَا أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَلَوْ كُنْتُ أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ لَاسْتَكْثَرْتُ مِنَ الْخَيْرِ وَمَا مَسَّنِيَ السُّوءُ ۚ إِنْ أَنَا إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"189","text":"It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord, (saying): \"If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful.\"","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to the origin of humanity and the family unit, starting a new line of argument about acknowledging Allah's oneness. It reminds people that Allah created all of humanity from a single soul or person (referring to Adam), and created his mate (Eve) from that same nature. This was so that the man could find comfort, love, and companionship with her. The verse beautifully describes the initial stages of pregnancy as a \"light burden\" carried easily. As the pregnancy progresses and becomes heavy, both parents naturally turn to Allah, their Lord, in pure human nature, praying for a healthy child and vowing to be grateful if their wish is granted. This highlights the innate tendency of human nature to turn to Allah in times of hope and need, acknowledging Him as the source of blessings.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا لِيَسْكُنَ إِلَيْهَا ۖ فَلَمَّا تَغَشَّاهَا حَمَلَتْ حَمْلًا خَفِيفًا فَمَرَّتْ بِهِ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَثْقَلَتْ دَعَوَا اللَّهَ رَبَّهُمَا لَئِنْ آتَيْتَنَا صَالِحًا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"190","text":"But when He giveth them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but Allah is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him.","commentary":"Following the previous verse, which describes the couple naturally turning to Allah in hope during pregnancy, this verse describes a deviation from that natural state. It shows that after Allah answers their prayers and blesses them with the desired healthy child, they sometimes begin to associate partners with Allah, attributing a share in this blessing to other entities. This could be by making pledges or offerings to idols or other beings, believing they had a role in the child's well-being, despite having initially prayed *only* to Allah. This verse highlights the folly of such actions, stating that Allah is far above having any partners associated with Him. It serves as an example of how people can deviate from acknowledging Allah's sole power and grace, even in receiving gifts that they initially sought from Him alone.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا آتَاهُمَا صَالِحًا جَعَلَا لَهُ شُرَكَاءَ فِيمَا آتَاهُمَا ۚ فَتَعَالَى اللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ"},{"verse":"191","text":"Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created?","commentary":"This verse follows the example in the previous verse and presents a direct challenge to the practice of associating partners with Allah. It questions the logic and reason behind worshipping or giving divine attributes to things or beings that cannot create anything. It points out the undeniable truth that these supposed partners are themselves created beings or objects. The rhetorical question emphasizes the irrationality of seeking help, attributing blessings, or offering worship to entities that lack the fundamental divine power of creation and are themselves dependent on a creator. This verse directly attacks the foundation of idolatry by highlighting the complete powerlessness and created nature of everything besides Allah.","arabic":"أَيُشْرِكُونَ مَا لَا يَخْلُقُ شَيْئًا وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ"},{"verse":"192","text":"No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves!","commentary":"This verse clarifies the absolute inability of the entities that people associate with Allah. It emphasizes that these beings or objects cannot provide any help or support to those who rely on them. Furthermore, they are so powerless that they cannot even help or protect themselves. This highlights their utter lack of capacity and serves as a logical argument against worshipping or relying upon anything other than Allah. This point follows directly from the previous verse which mentioned that these entities cannot create anything.","arabic":"وَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ لَهُمْ نَصْرًا وَلَا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَنْصُرُونَ"},{"verse":"193","text":"If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace!","commentary":"Building on the theme of powerlessness, this verse states that if you call upon these entities for guidance, they are unable to respond or follow. It underscores the futility of addressing them or expecting anything from them, stating that calling out to them is as useless as remaining silent. This emphasizes that true guidance comes only from Allah, and anything worshipped or called upon besides Him is incapable of providing it. This continues the argument from the previous verse about their lack of ability.","arabic":"وَإِنْ تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى الْهُدَىٰ لَا يَتَّبِعُوكُمْ ۚ سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ أَدَعَوْتُمُوهُمْ أَمْ أَنْتُمْ صَامِتُونَ"},{"verse":"194","text":"Verily those whom ye call upon besides Allah are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful!","commentary":"This verse challenges the worshippers of entities other than Allah by stating clearly that these entities are merely creations, just like human beings. They are described as \"servants\" of Allah, meaning they are subject to His will and power, just like everyone and everything else in existence. A challenge is then issued: Call upon these entities and see if they can hear and respond to your prayers, if your claims about them having divine power are true. This stark comparison and challenge expose the irrationality of seeking help or divine intervention from fellow creations rather than the Creator Himself.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ ۖ فَادْعُوهُمْ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"195","text":"Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: \"Call your 'god-partners', scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite!","commentary":"The argument against worshipping powerless entities continues by pointing out their physical limitations. The verse asks rhetorical questions, highlighting that these entities lack basic senses and abilities possessed even by humans (feet to walk, hands to grasp, eyes to see, ears to hear). This is a direct appeal to human reason, questioning how something so limited could possess divine qualities. Following this, Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to issue a bold challenge to those who associate partners with Allah: Gather all your associated partners and plot against me with all your might, without any delay. This fearless challenge demonstrates absolute reliance on Allah's protection.","arabic":"أَلَهُمْ أَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَا ۖ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَا ۖ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا ۖ أَمْ لَهُمْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۗ قُلِ ادْعُوا شُرَكَاءَكُمْ ثُمَّ كِيدُونِ فَلَا تُنْظِرُونِ"},{"verse":"196","text":"\"For my Protector is Allah, Who revealed the Book (from time to time), and He will choose and befriend the righteous.","commentary":"This verse explains the source of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) confidence in issuing the challenge in the previous verse. He declares that his protector and supporter is Allah alone, the One who sent down the Holy Book (the Qur'an). This highlights Allah's power as the source of revelation and protection. It also assures that Allah is the guardian and helper of those who are righteous, emphasizing the connection between faith, righteous action, and divine support. This stands in clear contrast to the powerlessness of the entities mentioned earlier.","arabic":"إِنَّ وَلِيِّيَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ الْكِتَابَ ۖ وَهُوَ يَتَوَلَّى الصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"197","text":"\"But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves.\"","commentary":"This verse reiterates the core message concerning the entities worshipped besides Allah. It strongly re-emphasizes that they are completely incapable of offering any assistance to those who call upon them. Moreover, their powerlessness is so absolute that they cannot even provide help for themselves. This reinforces the central theme of the passage, contrasting the unique power and protection of Allah (mentioned in the previous verse) with the utter weakness of anything associated with Him.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَكُمْ وَلَا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَنْصُرُونَ"},{"verse":"198","text":"If thou callest them to guidance, they hear not. Thou wilt see them looking at thee, but they see not.","commentary":"This verse concludes this section by further illustrating the lifelessness and unresponsiveness of the entities worshipped alongside Allah. It states that even if you call upon them, particularly for guidance, they simply cannot hear you. Furthermore, it points out their deceptive appearance – they might seem to be looking, but they lack true sight and perception. This reinforces the earlier points about their inability to hear (Verse 193) and see (Verse 195), emphasizing that seeking anything from them is utterly pointless because they are devoid of life and understanding.","arabic":"وَإِنْ تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى الْهُدَىٰ لَا يَسْمَعُوا ۖ وَتَرَاهُمْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"199","text":"Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant.","commentary":"This verse offers important guidance on how believers should interact with others, particularly those who might oppose or misunderstand their message. It encourages holding onto forgiveness, meaning to be lenient, overlook mistakes, and be accepting of people's limitations, especially in personal interactions. It also directs believers to encourage what is right – actions and values that are inherently good and recognized as such by sound human nature. Finally, it advises turning away from those who choose to remain in a state of spiritual or moral ignorance, suggesting that engaging in endless, unproductive arguments with them is not beneficial. This doesn't mean complete isolation, but rather avoiding futile disputes that only increase stubbornness.","arabic":"خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"200","text":"If a suggestion from Satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with Allah; for He heareth and knoweth (all things).","commentary":"Following the advice in the previous verse to turn away from the ignorant, which might sometimes lead to frustration or anger, this verse addresses what to do if negative thoughts or temptations arise. It acknowledges that dealing with challenging situations or people might lead to negative impulses or suggestions, described here as coming from Satan (representing evil or negative influence). The guidance is to seek refuge with Allah. This means turning to Allah for spiritual protection and strength, recognizing His constant awareness and knowledge of all things, seen and unseen, which provides comfort and reassurance. This act of seeking refuge helps a person regain composure and clarity.","arabic":"وَإِمَّا يَنْزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"201","text":"Those who fear Allah, when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them, bring Allah to remembrance, when lo! they see (aright)!","commentary":"This verse expands on the previous one, describing the characteristic response of those who are mindful of Allah and strive to avoid His displeasure. When faced with a negative thought or temptation from the forces of evil (Satan), they immediately remember Allah. This remembrance acts as a spiritual wake-up call, sharpening their awareness and allowing them to see the situation clearly, recognizing the nature of the temptation and the right path. It highlights that spiritual mindfulness is a key defense against negative influences and leads to clear understanding and right action. This contrasts with the \"ignorant\" mentioned in Verse 199, showing that being mindful of Allah helps one overcome the state of spiritual blindness.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا إِذَا مَسَّهُمْ طَائِفٌ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ تَذَكَّرُوا فَإِذَا هُمْ مُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"202","text":"But their brethren (the evil ones) plunge them deeper into error, and never relax (their efforts).","commentary":"In contrast to the believers described in the previous verse who overcome temptation by remembering Allah, this verse speaks about those who are influenced by negative forces or evil companions (referred to as \"their brethren,\" implying a connection or influence). These negative influences constantly work to lead such people further into error and misguidance. They do not cease their efforts, highlighting the persistent nature of negative influences on those who are not grounded in spiritual mindfulness. This verse explains why the \"ignorant\" mentioned earlier might remain resistant to guidance – they are actively being pulled deeper into misdirection.","arabic":"وَإِخْوَانُهُمْ يَمُدُّونَهُمْ فِي الْغَيِّ ثُمَّ لَا يُقْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"203","text":"If thou bring them not a revelation, they say: \"Why hast thou not got it together?\" Say: \"I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord: this is (nothing but) lights from your Lord, and Guidance, and mercy, for any who have faith.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses the response of those who remain in the state of ignorance, particularly their demands for Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to produce specific signs or miracles if he didn't immediately bring a new revelation. They would question why he didn't simply \"get it together\" or produce what they wanted on demand. Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to tell them that his role is simply to follow what is revealed to him by his Lord. He doesn't act on his own initiative or produce miracles at will. He is merely conveying the divine message. The verse then describes the nature of this revelation, the Qur'an, as \"lights from your Lord,\" \"Guidance,\" and \"mercy.\" It emphasizes that this divine message itself is the true sign and source of clear understanding, offering guidance and blessings, but its benefit is fully realized only by those who choose to believe. This verse connects back to the state of error mentioned in Verse 202, presenting the Qur'an as the means to overcome that darkness.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بِآيَةٍ قَالُوا لَوْلَا اجْتَبَيْتَهَا ۚ قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَتَّبِعُ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ مِنْ رَبِّي ۚ هَٰذَا بَصَائِرُ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"204","text":"When the Qur'an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that ye may receive Mercy.","commentary":"Following the description of the Qur'an as light, guidance, and mercy in the previous verse, this verse gives a specific instruction regarding how believers should engage with it. When the Qur'an is recited, they are commanded to listen attentively and remain silent. This is an act of respect for Allah's word and is presented as a means to receive Allah's mercy. Different situations where this applies have been discussed by scholars, including during prayer when an Imam recites aloud, but the general principle is that giving focused attention and silence to the recitation of the Qur'an helps one absorb its meaning and benefit from its spiritual impact, thereby opening the door to divine mercy.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قُرِئَ الْقُرْآنُ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ وَأَنْصِتُوا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ"},{"verse":"205","text":"And do thou (O reader!) Bring thy Lord to remembrance in thy (very) soul, with humility and in reverence, without loudness in words, in the mornings and evenings; and be not thou of those who are unheedful.","commentary":"This verse shifts from the outward act of listening to the Qur'an to the inward state of remembering Allah. It instructs the believer (or reader) to remember Allah within themselves, with humility and reverence. This remembrance should be sincere and internal, without needing to raise one's voice, particularly in the mornings and evenings. These times are highlighted as periods when focusing on this spiritual connection can be particularly beneficial. The verse concludes with a warning not to be among the unheedful or negligent – those who forget Allah and lose spiritual awareness. This builds on the idea of remembering Allah from Verse 201 as a defense against negative influences, urging it as a consistent practice.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرْ رَبَّكَ فِي نَفْسِكَ تَضَرُّعًا وَخِيفَةً وَدُونَ الْجَهْرِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ وَلَا تَكُنْ مِنَ الْغَافِلِينَ"},{"verse":"206","text":"Those who are near to thy Lord, disdain not to do Him worship: They celebrate His praises, and prostrate before Him.","commentary":"Concluding this passage, this verse provides an example of the ideal state of connection with Allah by referencing those who are close to Him, such as the angels. It highlights that these beings are never too proud to worship Allah; they constantly celebrate His praises and humbly prostrate before Him (an act of utmost submission). This serves as a model for humans, who, despite their imperfections and susceptibility to forgetfulness (as warned in Verse 205), should strive for this level of consistent worship and humility. It reinforces the importance of the practices mentioned throughout these verses – seeking refuge, remembering Allah, listening to His word – as essential ways for humans to draw near to Allah and overcome the challenges and temptations they face.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيُسَبِّحُونَهُ وَلَهُ يَسْجُدُونَ ۩"}];
