    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Of Allah, to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty (their Unfaith will bring them)!-","commentary":"This verse begins with letters whose meaning is known only to Allah. It then states that this is a divine Book revealed to the Prophet. The purpose of this revelation is to guide all of humanity out of various forms of spiritual and moral darkness – the darkness of confusion, false beliefs, and misguided ways of life – and bring them into the light of truth, guidance, and clear understanding. This transformation happens by the permission of Allah, leading people to the path of the Almighty, the One who holds all power and is deserving of all praise. The Prophet's role is to deliver this message, but the actual change from darkness to light is facilitated by Allah's will.","arabic":"اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَوَيْلٌ لِلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ"},{"verse":"2","text":"Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and seek therein something crooked: they are astray by a long distance.","commentary":"This verse further describes Allah, stating that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him; He is the ultimate owner and controller of all existence. Following the previous verse's mention of guidance and Allah's path, this verse highlights the consequence for those who choose not to believe in Allah and follow His guidance. It warns of a severe suffering awaiting the disbelievers, linking their refusal to accept the truth and guidance offered in the previous verse to this outcome.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَسْتَحِبُّونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا عَلَى الْآخِرَةِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ بَعِيدٍ"},{"verse":"3","text":"We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make (things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in power, full of Wisdom.","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the characteristics of the disbelievers mentioned in Verse 2, explaining *why* they reject the guidance. They are people who prioritize worldly life over the eternal life to come. This focus on worldly gain or status leads them to actively prevent others from following Allah's straight path and to try to distort or corrupt that path, making it seem flawed. Because they turn away from the clear guidance and mislead others, they are described as having gone far astray from the truth. This verse clarifies the motivation behind the rejection and the warning given in the preceding verse.","arabic":"وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ رَسُولٍ إِلَّا بِلِسَانِ قَوْمِهِ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَهُمْ ۖ فَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"4","text":"We sent Moses with Our signs (and the command). \"Bring out thy people from the depths of darkness into light, and teach them to remember the Days of Allah.\" Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant,- grateful and appreciative.","commentary":"This verse explains a principle of divine communication: every messenger sent by Allah spoke in the language of his own people. This was essential so that the message could be clearly understood by those first addressed, enabling them to convey it to others. Although the message is made clear, the ultimate outcome of who accepts guidance and who goes astray is determined by Allah's will, in accordance with His perfect power and wisdom. The messengers deliver the truth (as mentioned in Verse 1), but belief and acceptance are ultimately subject to Allah's plan.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا أَنْ أَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Remember! Moses said to his people: \"Call to mind the favour of Allah to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women-folk live: therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.\"","commentary":"Connecting to the theme of sending messengers (Verse 4), this verse introduces Prophet Moses and his mission to his people, the Children of Israel. His command from Allah was similar to the general purpose of prophethood mentioned in Verse 1 – to lead his people out of darkness into light. Additionally, he was instructed to remind them of the \"Days of Allah,\" meaning significant events in their history where they witnessed Allah's power, judgment, or favor. These historical moments serve as lessons and signs, particularly for those who endure hardship with patience and show deep gratitude for blessings.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ أَنْجَاكُمْ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلَاءٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"6","text":"And remember! your Lord caused to be declared (publicly): \"If ye are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed.\"","commentary":"Following the instruction in Verse 5 to remember the \"Days of Allah,\" Prophet Moses reminds his people of a specific, significant historical event: their rescue from the oppression of Pharaoh and his people. He details the severe suffering they endured, including forced labor, cruel punishments, and the killing of their male infants while sparing the females. Prophet Moses highlights that this period of suffering and their eventual deliverance was a great test (trial) from Allah. This serves as a concrete example of Allah's favor that they were commanded to remember.","arabic":"وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِنْ شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ وَلَئِنْ كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ"},{"verse":"7","text":"And Moses said: \"If ye show ingratitude, ye and all on earth together, yet is Allah free of all wants, worthy of all praise.","commentary":"Continuing the reminder of Allah's dealings with them (Verse 6), Prophet Moses conveys a divine declaration regarding the principle of gratitude and ingratitude. Allah had made it clear that if they were thankful for His blessings, He would increase those blessings for them. Conversely, if they were ungrateful, they would face severe punishment. This declaration underscores the importance of recognizing and appreciating Allah's favors, linking their historical deliverance to a fundamental spiritual principle.","arabic":"وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ إِنْ تَكْفُرُوا أَنْتُمْ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"Has not the story reached you, (O people!), of those who (went) before you? - of the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud? - And of those who (came) after them? None knows them but Allah. To them came messengers with Clear (Signs); but they put their hands up to their mouths, and said: \"We do deny (the mission) on which ye have been sent, and we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which ye invite us.\"","commentary":"Building on the principle of gratitude from Verse 7, Prophet Moses emphasizes Allah's absolute independence and perfection. He states that even if Prophet Moses himself and everyone else on Earth were to be ungrateful or disbelieve, it would not diminish Allah in any way. Allah is completely self-sufficient and inherently deserving of all praise, independent of human actions. This highlights that human gratitude and belief benefit humanity itself, not Allah.","arabic":"أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ ۛ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ۛ لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ۚ جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَرَدُّوا أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِي أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَقَالُوا إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَا أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِمَّا تَدْعُونَنَا إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ"},{"verse":"9","text":"Their messengers said: \"Is there a doubt about Allah, The Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you, in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed!\" They said: \"Ah! ye are no more than human, like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from the (gods) our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority.\"","commentary":"Shifting focus from Prophet Moses's immediate people (though connected as a historical reminder), this verse asks if the audience has not heard the stories of earlier peoples who faced messengers – such as the people of Prophet Noah, 'Ad, and Thamud, and many others known only to Allah. It states that messengers came to them with clear signs of truth. However, these people rejected the messengers, expressing open denial and deep doubt about the message. Their action of putting hands to mouths indicated their strong and perhaps dismissive rejection. This shows a recurring pattern of past communities receiving guidance but choosing disbelief, linking back to the consequences mentioned for disbelievers earlier in the chapter.","arabic":"قَالَتْ رُسُلُهُمْ أَفِي اللَّهِ شَكٌّ فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُمْ مِنْ ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُؤَخِّرَكُمْ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى ۚ قَالُوا إِنْ أَنْتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَصُدُّونَا عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا فَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَانٍ مُبِينٍ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Their messengers said to them: \"True, we are human like yourselves, but Allah doth grant His grace to such of his servants as He pleases. It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits. And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust.","commentary":"This verse continues the dialogue from Verse 9, presenting the messengers' response to the people's doubt. The messengers express astonishment that there could be doubt about Allah, the One who created the vast heavens and the earth, pointing to creation as clear evidence of His existence. They explain that Allah's call through them is an invitation for forgiveness of sins and a grant of time (respite) before any consequence. The people, however, dismissed the messengers based on their human nature, accusing them of trying to turn them away from their ancestral worship. They demanded a tangible, undeniable proof or miracle. This highlights the core conflict: the messengers emphasizing belief in the Creator and Allah's grace, while the people focused on the messengers' human status and clung to tradition, demanding physical proof over spiritual truth.","arabic":"قَالَتْ لَهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ إِنْ نَحْنُ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُكُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَمُنُّ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لَنَا أَنْ نَأْتِيَكُمْ بِسُلْطَانٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"\"No reason have we why we should not put our trust on Allah. Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we (follow). We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust on Allah.\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse where the messengers were challenged about their humanity and asked for a miracle, this verse shares the messengers' reply. They acknowledge their human nature, stating, \"True, we are human like yourselves.\" However, they clarify that while they are human, their role as messengers is a matter of Allah's grace and choice. Allah chooses whom He wills from among His servants to receive His message and guidance. They emphasize that they cannot perform miracles or bring signs on their own authority; such actions are entirely dependent on Allah's permission. They conclude by stating a fundamental principle for believers: \"And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust.\" This highlights that reliance and dependence should be placed solely on Allah.","arabic":"وَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نَتَوَكَّلَ عَلَى اللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانَا سُبُلَنَا ۚ وَلَنَصْبِرَنَّ عَلَىٰ مَا آذَيْتُمُونَا ۚ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"And the Unbelievers said to their messengers: \"Be sure we shall drive you out of our land, or ye shall return to our religion.\" But their Lord inspired (this Message) to them: \"Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish!","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's declaration of trust in Allah, the messengers further explain their deep reliance. They assert that there is no reason for them *not* to trust in Allah because \"Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we (follow).\" This guidance is a source of certainty and strength. Because they are confident in Allah's guidance and place their trust in Him, they declare their resolve to \"certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us.\" This shows their steadfastness in the face of opposition and persecution. They reiterate the principle from the previous verse, emphasizing that placing trust in Allah is the proper course for all who have faith.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لِرُسُلِهِمْ لَنُخْرِجَنَّكُمْ مِنْ أَرْضِنَا أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا ۖ فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"\"And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land, and succeed them. This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal,- such as fear the punishment denounced.\"","commentary":"This verse shifts from the dialogue between the messengers and their people to the reaction of those who rejected the message. In response to the messengers' steadfastness and call to Allah, the rejecting communities resort to threats and coercion. They issue an ultimatum: either the messengers and their followers will be expelled from their land, or they must abandon their new faith and \"return to our religion,\" meaning the ways and beliefs of the dominant society. This illustrates the intolerance shown by societies that reject divine guidance towards those who choose to follow it, demanding conformity or expulsion. In response to this tyrannical threat against His messengers, Allah reveals a promise to the messengers: \"Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish!\" This offers divine assurance against the human threat.","arabic":"وَلَنُسْكِنَنَّكُمُ الْأَرْضَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِي وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ"},{"verse":"14","text":"But they sought victory and decision (there and then), and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor.","commentary":"Following the divine promise to destroy the wrongdoers mentioned in the previous verse, this verse reveals the next part of Allah's promise to the messengers and their followers. Allah promises that they will be granted the land and will succeed those who were destroyed. This establishes a pattern where those who stand against divine guidance are removed, and those who patiently endure persecution and remain steadfast in their faith are granted authority and settlement. The verse clarifies that this promise is specifically for those who fear standing before Allah for judgment and fear the punishment He has warned against. This emphasizes that inheriting the land is a reward for piety and mindfulness of the Hereafter, not merely a worldly gain.","arabic":"وَاسْتَفْتَحُوا وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ"},{"verse":"15","text":"In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water.","commentary":"This verse reflects on the outcome of the confrontation described earlier. It notes that the rejecting communities, described as \"powerful obstinate transgressor[s],\" sought an immediate victory or decision against the messengers through their threats and force. However, despite their power and determination in opposing the truth, the ultimate outcome was \"frustration.\" This verse highlights the futility of relying on worldly power and obstinacy against Allah's will and plan, connecting back to the divine promise of destruction for the wrongdoers (Verse 13). It sets the stage for illustrating the ultimate fate of such individuals, which is described in the verses that follow.","arabic":"مِنْ وَرَائِهِ جَهَنَّمُ وَيُسْقَىٰ مِنْ مَاءٍ صَدِيدٍ"},{"verse":"16","text":"In gulps will he sip it, but never will he be near swallowing it down his throat: death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting.","commentary":"Following the description of the obstinate transgressor's frustration in this life (Verse 15), this verse begins to describe their fate in the Hereafter. It starkly states that Hell is \"in front of such a one,\" signifying the inescapable destination that awaits them. As part of their punishment, they are described as being given \"boiling fetid water\" to drink. This imagery conveys a severe and repulsive torment, contrasting sharply with any fleeting power or comfort they might have enjoyed in the worldly life. This verse initiates a description of the suffering in Hell, which continues into the next verse.","arabic":"يَتَجَرَّعُهُ وَلَا يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِنْ كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ ۖ وَمِنْ وَرَائِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ"},{"verse":"17","text":"The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day: No power have they over aught that they have earned: that is the straying far, far (from the goal).","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the torment in Hell introduced in the previous verse (Verse 16). It elaborates on the suffering associated with drinking the boiling, foul water, depicting the difficulty and agony of attempting to swallow it. The phrase \"death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die\" emphasizes the perpetual, inescapable nature of the suffering. They will experience the sensation of dying repeatedly without ever finding the release of actual death, ensuring the continuation of their punishment. The verse concludes by stating that \"in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting,\" indicating that this suffering is just the beginning, and more severe and continuous punishment lies ahead.","arabic":"مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ ۖ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ ۖ لَا يَقْدِرُونَ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلَالُ الْبَعِيدُ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Seest thou not that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He so will, He can remove you and put (in your place) a new creation?","commentary":"This verse uses a powerful analogy to describe the ultimate worthlessness of the actions of those who reject Allah. It compares their deeds, no matter how grand they may appear in this life, to \"ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day.\" Just as ashes are scattered and dispersed beyond recovery by a strong wind, the works of those who reject Allah will be rendered useless and without substance in the Hereafter. They will find that they have \"No power... over aught that they have earned,\" meaning their efforts will yield no benefit or reward. The verse identifies this state as \"the straying far, far (from the goal),\" indicating that rejecting Allah leads one completely away from the true purpose and desired outcome of life.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ إِنْ يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Nor is that for Allah any great matter.","commentary":"Following the description of the ultimate fate of those who reject Allah and the futility of their deeds, this verse shifts to emphasize Allah's immense power and sovereignty. It directs attention to the creation of the universe, asking rhetorically, \"Seest thou not that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth?\" The creation of the vast cosmos is presented as evidence of Allah's absolute power and the inherent truth and reality of His existence and dominion. This serves as a foundation for the subsequent statement: \"If He so will, He can remove you and put (in your place) a new creation?\" This is a warning to those who reject Him, reminding them that the Creator of the universe has the power to easily replace the current creation, including humanity, with something entirely new if He chooses. This highlights their insignificance in the face of Allah's power.","arabic":"وَمَا ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ"},{"verse":"20","text":"They will all be marshalled before Allah together: then will the weak say to those who were arrogant, \"For us, we but followed you; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of Allah?\" They will reply, \"If we had received the Guidance of Allah, we should have given it to you: to us it makes no difference (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience: for ourselves there is no way of escape.\"","commentary":"This short verse directly follows the previous one (Verse 19) which spoke about Allah's ability to replace the current creation with a new one. It serves as a concluding statement to emphasize the ease with which Allah can accomplish this. By stating \"Nor is that for Allah any great matter,\" the verse underscores that the seemingly immense act of removing and replacing entire creation is trivial in comparison to Allah's infinite power and capability, which is evident in the creation of the heavens and the earth themselves. This reinforces the warning from the previous verse, making it clear that defying Allah is futile given the effortless nature of His power to bring about change or consequences.","arabic":"وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا فَقَالَ الضُّعَفَاءُ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُوا إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُغْنُونَ عَنَّا مِنْ عَذَابِ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ قَالُوا لَوْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ لَهَدَيْنَاكُمْ ۖ سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْنَا أَجَزِعْنَا أَمْ صَبَرْنَا مَا لَنَا مِنْ مَحِيصٍ"},{"verse":"21","text":"And Satan will say when the matter is decided: \"It was Allah Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but ye listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries, nor can ye listen to mine. I reject your former act in associating me with Allah. For wrong-doers there must be a grievous penalty.\"","commentary":"This verse paints a picture of the Day of Judgment, when everyone will be gathered before Allah. It describes a scene where those who were weak followers in this life turn to their arrogant leaders, saying, \"We just followed you; can you protect us from Allah's punishment?\" The arrogant leaders reply that if they themselves had followed the guidance from Allah, they would have shared it, but now it makes no difference whether they panic or try to be patient – there is no escape for any of them from the consequence of their actions. This highlights the principle that everyone is accountable for their choices, and following others blindly will not absolve a person on that Day.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدْتُكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ إِلَّا أَنْ دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي ۖ فَلَا تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ ۖ مَا أَنَا بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِيَّ ۖ إِنِّي كَفَرْتُ بِمَا أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۗ إِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"22","text":"But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow,- to dwell therein for aye with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: \"Peace!\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse which showed the despair of wrongdoers and their leaders, this verse describes a striking moment after judgment has been passed. Satan addresses those who followed him, declaring that Allah's promise of truth was indeed true, while his own promises to them were false and unfulfilled. He admits he had no power to force them; he only called out to them, and they chose to respond. He tells them not to blame him, but to blame themselves for their choices. He emphasizes that neither he nor they can help each other now and disavows their past act of associating him with Allah in any way. This powerful scene underscores personal responsibility and reveals the ultimate deception inherent in following anything other than the path of truth from Allah.","arabic":"وَأُدْخِلَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَامٌ"},{"verse":"23","text":"Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable? - A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the heavens,- of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition.","commentary":"In contrast to the grim fate of the wrongdoers described in the previous verses, this verse offers a vision of hope and reward for those who lived a life of faith and good deeds. It describes them being welcomed into beautiful gardens where rivers flow, signifying a place of immense comfort and plenty. They will live there eternally with Allah's permission, and their greeting among themselves will be \"Peace,\" reflecting the serenity and security of their state. This verse connects back to the theme of accountability by showing the positive outcome for those who chose the right path, providing a clear contrast to the fate of the disbelievers and their leaders discussed earlier.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاءِ"},{"verse":"24","text":"It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition.","commentary":"Building upon the outcomes described for different groups in the previous verses, Allah now presents a parable to help us understand the nature and impact of truth versus falsehood. This verse compares a \"goodly word\"—which can be understood as the declaration of faith, truth, or any upright principle—to a beautiful tree. This tree has deep, firm roots, symbolizing stability and strong foundation. Its branches reach high towards the sky, indicating its expansive influence and connection to the Divine. Allah uses such parables to make important truths understandable and relatable, encouraging people to reflect on the stability and reach of good principles.","arabic":"تُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا ۗ وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"And the parable of an evil Word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability.","commentary":"Continuing the parable from the previous verse, this verse describes the \"goodly tree\" as constantly producing fruit. This illustrates how the truth and good principles are not just stable but also perpetually beneficial, yielding positive results and blessings throughout different times and circumstances, always with Allah's permission. The constant fruiting symbolizes the enduring impact of faith and good deeds across generations. As stated at the end of the verse, Allah uses these comparisons to help people understand and take lessons.","arabic":"وَمَثَلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ اجْتُثَّتْ مِنْ فَوْقِ الْأَرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِنْ قَرَارٍ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.","commentary":"This verse provides a contrasting parable to the previous two. It compares an \"evil word\"—representing falsehood, disbelief, or corrupt principles—to a weak, \"evil tree.\" Unlike the deeply rooted good tree, this evil tree has shallow roots, barely clinging to the surface of the earth. This means it lacks stability and can be easily uprooted and destroyed. This parable emphasizes the inherent weakness and temporary nature of falsehood and evil, no matter how imposing it may appear at times. It contrasts directly with the stability and enduring fruitfulness of truth discussed in the preceding verses.","arabic":"يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who have changed the favour of Allah. Into blasphemy and caused their people to descend to the House of Perdition?-","commentary":"Bringing the parables back to human life and destiny, this verse explains their meaning. Just as the \"goodly tree\" is firmly rooted, Allah strengthens those who believe with the \"word that stands firm\"—which can refer to faith itself, the truth of the Qur'an, or Allah's unwavering promise—giving them stability in this life and in the Hereafter. Conversely, like the unstable \"evil tree,\" Allah allows those who choose wrong (often understood as associating partners with Allah or acting unjustly) to wander astray as a consequence of their own actions and choices. This shows how the paths of belief and disbelief lead to fundamentally different outcomes based on their inherent nature, reflecting Allah's will and justice in determining consequences.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ بَدَّلُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ كُفْرًا وَأَحَلُّوا قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ الْبَوَارِ"},{"verse":"28","text":"Into Hell? They will burn therein,- an evil place to stay in!","commentary":"This verse begins by asking us to consider those who have taken the great blessings Allah has given them and instead chosen to deny the truth and act in disbelief. This is a significant act, as it not only affects them but also leads their communities down a path of destruction, referred to here as the \"House of Perdition.\" The commentary notes that these people often represent the leaders or influential figures within a society, whose choices have far-reaching consequences for those who follow them. This introduces the theme of rejecting Allah's favors and its severe outcome, which is further explained in the verses that follow.","arabic":"جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْقَرَارُ"},{"verse":"29","text":"And they set up (idols) as equal to Allah, to mislead (men) from the Path! Say: \"Enjoy (your brief power)! But verily ye are making straightway for Hell!\"","commentary":"Following the previous verse's mention of the \"House of Perdition,\" this verse clarifies that this destination is Hell. It describes Hell as a place of burning and emphasizes that it is a terrible and undesirable final abode. This verse directly describes the consequence for those who change Allah's favor into disbelief, highlighting the severity of their choice and the path of destruction they lead their people to. It serves as a stark warning about the outcome of rejecting truth and guidance.","arabic":"وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا لِيُضِلُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۗ قُلْ تَمَتَّعُوا فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى النَّارِ"},{"verse":"30","text":"Speak to my servants who have believed, that they may establish regular prayers, and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance we have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.","commentary":"This verse explains *how* the people mentioned previously turn away from Allah's favor and lead others astray. They set up things or beings alongside Allah, treating them as if they are equal to Him in importance, authority, or worship. This act is done deliberately to divert people from the only right path, which is the path of acknowledging Allah's oneness and following His guidance. The verse instructs the Prophet to tell these people to enjoy their temporary power or worldly benefits, as their ultimate destination is inevitably Hell. This verse connects back to the initial point about exchanging Allah's favor for disbelief, explaining that a core aspect of this disbelief is setting up partners or equals with Allah and its consequence in the hereafter.","arabic":"قُلْ لِعِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُنْفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خِلَالٌ"},{"verse":"31","text":"It is Allah Who hath created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down rain from the skies, and with it bringeth out fruits wherewith to feed you; it is He Who hath made the ships subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the rivers (also) hath He made subject to you.","commentary":"In contrast to the disbelievers discussed in the previous verses, this verse shifts the focus to the believers. It instructs the Prophet to tell those who have accepted faith to show their gratitude for Allah's blessings by establishing regular prayers and giving charity from what Allah has provided for them. Prayer is presented as a primary way of expressing gratitude to Allah, while charity, given both privately and publicly, reflects kindness to others and obedience to divine commands. This should be done diligently before a specific Day arrives when there will be no opportunity for negotiation or worldly relationships to offer protection or benefit. This verse acts as a direct counterpoint to the actions of the disbelievers, outlining the actions of gratitude and preparation for the hereafter that believers are called to undertake.","arabic":"اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَأَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَكُمْ ۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ الْفُلْكَ لِتَجْرِيَ فِي الْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ ۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ الْأَنْهَارَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"And He hath made subject to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day hath he (also) made subject to you.","commentary":"Beginning a detailed list of Allah's blessings, this verse highlights His role as the Creator of the vast heavens and the earth. It points to the cycle of rain coming down from the sky, which causes fruits to grow, providing sustenance for people. It also mentions how Allah has made ships subservient, allowing them to sail across the seas by His power, and how rivers are made useful for human benefit. These are presented as clear signs of Allah's power and grace, laying the foundation for the point about His countless favors to humanity that follows.","arabic":"وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ دَائِبَيْنِ ۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ"},{"verse":"33","text":"And He giveth you of all that ye ask for. But if ye count the favours of Allah, never will ye be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude.","commentary":"Continuing the list of blessings, this verse draws attention to celestial bodies – the sun and the moon. It explains that these great objects follow their paths precisely under Allah's command, and are made subservient for human benefit. Similarly, the alternation of night and day is also arranged to serve human needs, providing times for activity and rest. These phenomena, though distant, are vital for life on Earth and are presented as further evidence of Allah's intricate design and care for humanity, building upon the examples given in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَآتَاكُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ ۚ وَإِنْ تَعُدُّوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا ۗ إِنَّ الْإِنْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ"},{"verse":"34","text":"Remember Abraham said: \"O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols.","commentary":"This verse summarizes the immense scale of Allah's generosity, stating that He gives people much of what they ask for. It then emphasizes the sheer countlessness of Allah's favors, saying that even if one were to try, they could never fully enumerate them. Despite this overwhelming generosity and the clear signs of His power and care presented in the preceding verses (32-33), the verse concludes by noting that people often act unjustly and are ungrateful. This contrasts sharply with the call to gratitude through prayer and charity mentioned in Verse 31 and provides a powerful commentary on human nature in the face of divine blessings.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"\"O my Lord! they have indeed led astray many among mankind; He then who follows my (ways) is of me, and he that disobeys me,- but Thou art indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"Following the discussion of Allah's blessings and human ingratitude, the narrative shifts to the example of Prophet Abraham, a figure known for his devotion. This verse recounts a part of his prayer, where he asks Allah to make the city (referring to Makkah) a place of peace and security. Immediately after, he prays for himself and his children to be protected from worshipping idols. This prayer highlights the importance of both physical security and spiritual purity (avoiding associating partners with Allah), setting a positive example of recognizing Allah's Lordship and seeking protection from misguidance, contrasting with the negative examples of ungratefulness and setting up equals mentioned earlier.","arabic":"رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِنَ النَّاسِ ۖ فَمَنْ تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي ۖ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"36","text":"\"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks.","commentary":"Prophet Abraham continues his prayer, acknowledging that idols or those who promote their worship have led many people astray. He then states that anyone who follows his path of monotheism and submission to Allah is connected to him (through faith). Regarding those who disobey him and deviate from his path, he leaves their matter to Allah's judgment, expressing his faith in Allah's attributes of being Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful. This part of the prayer shows Prophet Abraham's concern for humanity's guidance and his compassionate reliance on Allah's ultimate authority and mercy.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا إِنِّي أَسْكَنْتُ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِي زَرْعٍ عِنْدَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ وَارْزُقْهُمْ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"37","text":"\"O our Lord! truly Thou dost know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from Allah, whether on earth or in heaven.","commentary":"Prophet Abraham continues his heartfelt supplication, mentioning that he settled some of his descendants in a difficult, uncultivated valley near Allah's Sacred House (the Ka'bah in Makkah). He explicitly states the *purpose* for settling them there: so that they could establish regular prayer. He then prays for Allah to make people's hearts incline towards them with love and to provide them with fruits, with the ultimate goal that they may give thanks to Allah for His provision. This prayer beautifully connects dwelling in a sacred place with the primary purpose of worship (prayer) and links material sustenance (fruits, people's love) to the act of expressing gratitude to Allah. It contrasts with the earlier verses that spoke of people failing to give thanks despite receiving countless blessings.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ تَعْلَمُ مَا نُخْفِي وَمَا نُعْلِنُ ۗ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ"},{"verse":"38","text":"\"Praise be to Allah, Who hath granted unto me in old age Isma'il and Isaac: for truly my Lord is He, the Hearer of Prayer!","commentary":"This verse is part of a prayer made by Prophet Abraham. It acknowledges Allah's perfect knowledge, stating that He is fully aware of everything we keep secret in our hearts and everything we make known openly. Prophet Abraham declares that absolutely nothing, whether on Earth or in the heavens, can be hidden from Allah's knowledge. This emphasizes the complete transparency of everything before Allah, highlighting His omniscience, which is a foundational aspect of faith. This statement sets the stage for the subsequent prayers by Abraham, reminding the listener that the One being supplicated is fully aware of the sincerity and needs within the heart.","arabic":"الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي وَهَبَ لِي عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَاءِ"},{"verse":"39","text":"O my Lord! make me one who establishes regular Prayer, and also (raise such) among my offspring O our Lord! and accept Thou my Prayer.","commentary":"Continuing his heartfelt prayer, Prophet Abraham expresses gratitude and praise to Allah for granting him children, Prophet Ishmael and Prophet Isaac, even in his old age. He recognizes this as a special blessing. By saying \"Praise be to Allah,\" he sets an example of thanking the Creator for His favors. He concludes this part of his prayer by affirming his belief that Allah is indeed the \"Hearer of Prayer,\" highlighting his complete trust that his supplications are heard and can be answered.","arabic":"رَبِّ اجْعَلْنِي مُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةِ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي ۚ رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَاءِ"},{"verse":"40","text":"\"O our Lord! cover (us) with Thy Forgiveness - me, my parents, and (all) Believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established!","commentary":"Prophet Abraham continues his supplication by praying for strength and guidance to perform the regular prayers properly and consistently. He also extends this prayer to his future generations, asking that some of his descendants also be guided to establish regular prayer. Prayer is a central act of worship in Islam, representing a direct connection with Allah and an expression of gratitude and submission. He concludes this specific plea by asking Allah to accept his entire prayer, demonstrating humility and reliance on Allah's grace. This prayer shows the importance Abraham placed on connecting with Allah through worship and wishing the same for his family.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيَّ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْحِسَابُ"},{"verse":"41","text":"Think not that Allah doth not heed the deeds of those who do wrong. He but giveth them respite against a Day when the eyes will fixedly stare in horror,-","commentary":"Concluding his long prayer, Prophet Abraham makes a universal plea for forgiveness. He asks Allah for forgiveness for himself, his parents, and all those who believe in Allah. This forgiveness is sought specifically for the Day of Reckoning, also known as the Day of Judgment, when everyone will be held accountable for their deeds. This prayer emphasizes the understanding that salvation on that crucial Day depends on Allah's mercy and forgiveness. It shows Prophet Abraham's compassionate heart, including his parents and all believers in his final, profound request. Having prayed for guidance and acceptance, he now seeks the ultimate mercy that covers shortcomings.","arabic":"وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَافِلًا عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّالِمُونَ ۚ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الْأَبْصَارُ"},{"verse":"42","text":"They running forward with necks outstretched, their heads uplifted, their gaze returning not towards them, and their hearts a (gaping) void!","commentary":"The discourse shifts from Prophet Abraham's prayer to address the state of those who commit wrongdoing. This verse warns against the misconception that Allah is unaware of or ignores the actions of wrongdoers. It clarifies that Allah does not immediately punish them but grants them a period of delay or respite. This delay is until a specific Day – the Day of Judgment – when their punishment is certain. On that Day, the verse describes the intense fear and horror they will experience, so severe that their eyes will stare fixedly, unable to even blink. This contrasts with the devotion and seeking of forgiveness shown by Prophet Abraham in the preceding verses, highlighting the different paths and their inevitable consequences.","arabic":"مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِي رُءُوسِهِمْ لَا يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ ۖ وَأَفْئِدَتُهُمْ هَوَاءٌ"},{"verse":"43","text":"So warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath will reach them: then will the wrong-doers say: \"Our Lord! respite us (if only) for a short term: we will answer Thy call, and follow the messengers!\" \"What! were ye not wont to swear aforetime that ye should suffer no decline?","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the wrongdoers on the Day of Judgment, vividly portraying their state of terror and confusion. They are depicted running forward in panic, with their necks strained and heads raised, compelled to look ahead at the horrific scene. Their gaze is fixed and cannot turn away from what they behold. Their hearts are described as utterly empty or void, perhaps from shock, extreme fear, or having no good deeds to sustain them. This paints a powerful picture of their helpless and overwhelmed state as they face the consequences of their actions, further emphasizing the severity of the Day warned about in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَأَنْذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا رَبَّنَا أَخِّرْنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ ۗ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُوا أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ زَوَالٍ"},{"verse":"44","text":"\"And ye dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged their own souls; ye were clearly shown how We dealt with them; and We put forth (many) parables in your behoof!\"","commentary":"This verse instructs the Prophet, and by extension all who convey Allah's message, to warn people about the Day when Allah's punishment will inevitably reach the wrongdoers. It describes the scene on that Day when these wrongdoers will desperately plead with Allah, acknowledging Him as their Lord (something they denied or ignored in their earthly lives). They will beg for just a short delay to return to Earth, promising to respond to Allah's call and follow the messengers they previously rejected. The response to their plea is immediate and reproachful, reminding them that they had previously sworn that they would never face such a downfall or decline, despite all the signs and warnings they received in their lives. This highlights the regret that comes too late.","arabic":"وَسَكَنْتُمْ فِي مَسَاكِنِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمْ كَيْفَ فَعَلْنَا بِهِمْ وَضَرَبْنَا لَكُمُ الْأَمْثَالَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"Mighty indeed were the plots which they made, but their plots were (well) within the sight of Allah, even though they were such as to shake the hills!","commentary":"This verse continues the stern reproach directed at the wrongdoers on the Day of Judgment, following their desperate plea for respite. They are reminded that they lived in the homes and lands previously inhabited by people who had wronged themselves and others through disbelief and sin. They had seen clear evidence of how Allah had dealt with those earlier generations – their ruins and history served as potent lessons. Furthermore, Allah had presented them with many examples and parables (lessons through stories and comparisons) to make the truth clear. This emphasizes their lack of heedfulness and stubborn refusal to learn from history and Allah's guidance, making their regret on this Day even more futile.","arabic":"وَقَدْ مَكَرُوا مَكْرَهُمْ وَعِنْدَ اللَّهِ مَكْرُهُمْ وَإِنْ كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Never think that Allah would fail his messengers in His promise: for Allah is Exalted in power, - the Lord of Retribution.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus back to the earthly life of the wrongdoers, specifically addressing the schemes and plots they devise, often against Allah's messengers and the truth. It acknowledges that their plans can be significant and appear powerful, perhaps even metaphorically strong enough to \"shake the hills\" (meaning they have a major impact or are deeply unsettling). However, it immediately reassures that despite the apparent might of their plots, they are entirely within Allah's sight and knowledge. Nothing they plan or execute is hidden from Him. This serves as a reassurance to the believers that Allah is aware of the opposition they face and that the wrongdoers' efforts are ultimately subject to His will and power.","arabic":"فَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ"},{"verse":"47","text":"One day the earth will be changed to a different earth, and so will be the heavens, and (men) will be marshalled forth, before Allah, the One, the Irresistible;","commentary":"Following the mention of the wrongdoers' plots, this verse provides a powerful reassurance and warning. It directly addresses Prophet Muhammad (and through him, all believers) never to doubt that Allah will fulfill His promises to His messengers. These promises include support, guidance, and ultimate victory for the truth, and accountability for those who oppose it. The verse affirms that Allah is Exalted in Power (Almighty), meaning nothing can hinder His will. He is also described as the Lord of Retribution (Al-Muntaqim), which signifies that He is the One who holds wrongdoers accountable and justly requites their actions, ensuring that injustice does not prevail unchecked. This is not about human revenge but about divine justice that sets things right. This reinforces the message that despite the schemes of the wrongdoers mentioned in the previous verse, Allah's plan and promise to His messengers will inevitably be fulfilled, leading to the reckoning described in earlier verses.","arabic":"يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الْأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ ۖ وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ"},{"verse":"48","text":"And thou wilt see the sinners that day bound together in fetters;-","commentary":"This verse describes the momentous Day of Judgment, a key event in the afterlife. It explains that on that day, the entire physical reality as we know it will undergo a fundamental transformation. The earth will be changed into a completely different kind of earth, and similarly, the heavens will be altered. This change is beyond our current comprehension, emphasizing the immense power of Allah. Following this universal change, all of humanity will be gathered together and presented before Allah, the One, the Irresistible. This highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty and power over all of creation and serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability mentioned later in the passage.","arabic":"وَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي الْأَصْفَادِ"},{"verse":"49","text":"Their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire;","commentary":"Building upon the scene of the changed earth and heavens where everyone is gathered, this verse specifically describes the state of those who committed wrongdoing in their earthly lives. On that terrifying Day, they will be seen bound together in chains or fetters. This imagery emphasizes their helplessness, humiliation, and inescapable fate, contrasting sharply with any power or defiance they might have displayed in this world.","arabic":"سَرَابِيلُهُمْ مِنْ قَطِرَانٍ وَتَغْشَىٰ وُجُوهَهُمُ النَّارُ"},{"verse":"50","text":"That Allah may requite each soul according to its deserts; and verily Allah is swift in calling to account.","commentary":"Continuing the description from the previous verse about the state of wrongdoers on the Day of Judgment, this verse provides more detail about their condition. They will be clothed in garments made of a substance resembling black pitch, which is easily combustible and adds to their distress and humiliation. Furthermore, their faces will be covered by Fire. This vivid imagery serves as a consequence of their actions and arrogance in their earthly lives, illustrating the severe suffering they will endure. This verse follows the description of them being chained, adding further details to their painful and ignominating punishment.","arabic":"لِيَجْزِيَ اللَّهُ كُلَّ نَفْسٍ مَا كَسَبَتْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"51","text":"Here is a Message for mankind: Let them take warning therefrom, and let them know that He is (no other than) One Allah: let men of understanding take heed.","commentary":"This verse explains the divine purpose behind the scenes depicted in the previous verses (48-50). The dramatic events of the Day of Judgment, including the transformation of the universe and the state of the wrongdoers, are all part of Allah's plan to justly compensate or punish every soul according to what it earned or did in this life. The verse also emphasizes that Allah is swift in settling accounts. This swiftness contrasts with any delays or respites granted in this world and highlights the inevitability and efficiency of divine justice when the time comes for reckoning.","arabic":"هَٰذَا بَلَاغٌ لِلنَّاسِ وَلِيُنْذَرُوا بِهِ وَلِيَعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ وَلِيَذَّكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"52","text":"","commentary":"This verse serves as a concluding summary and a direct message to all humanity, following the powerful descriptions of the Day of Judgment and its consequences. It declares that the preceding verses, and indeed the entire message conveyed through the Prophet, is a warning for all people. The primary purpose of this message is for humanity to understand and affirm that Allah is the One and Only God, deserving of all worship and submission. This core truth is the foundation of faith. The verse concludes by stating that those who possess insight and understanding are the ones who will truly benefit from this warning and take it to heart, recognizing the reality of Allah's oneness and the accountability that follows. This verse brings the focus back to the fundamental call of the entire Sura – leading people from darkness to light by knowing and submitting to the One Allah.","arabic":""}];
