    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This opening verse is the phrase Muslims use to begin many actions, including reading the Qur'an. It teaches us to start by invoking the name of Allah. It introduces Allah using two of His most significant names: *al-Rahman*, the Most Gracious, and *al-Rahim*, the Most Merciful. These names together describe the immense and all-encompassing nature of Allah's mercy and compassion, qualities that are uniquely His. Beginning with this phrase establishes a fundamental principle of recognizing Allah before commencing anything.","arabic":"بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ"},{"verse":"2","text":"Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds;","commentary":"Following the invocation of Allah's name and mercy, this verse directs us to offer praise to Him. Praising Allah is a natural response that arises from recognizing His immense grace and acknowledging that He is the source of all blessings and the Cherisher and Sustainer of everything that exists. The phrase \"Lord of all the worlds\" emphasizes that Allah is the sole Creator, Owner, and Manager of the entire universe, actively caring for and sustaining all of creation. This highlights Allah's unique and absolute authority over all things.","arabic":"الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Most Gracious, Most Merciful;","commentary":"These two attributes of Allah, Most Gracious (*al-Rahman*) and Most Merciful (*al-Rahim*), are repeated here after the declaration of His absolute Lordship. Their reiteration underscores the profound connection between Allah, the Creator, and His creation, a relationship built upon overwhelming mercy and compassion. This repetition serves to emphasize that Allah's interaction with the world and its inhabitants is characterized by love, care, and reassurance, which inspires deep gratitude and continuous praise from believers.","arabic":"الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ"},{"verse":"4","text":"Master of the Day of Judgment.","commentary":"This verse introduces another fundamental principle of Islam: belief in the Day of Judgment. By stating that Allah is the \"Master of the Day of Judgment,\" we affirm that He alone has complete control and authority over the day when all people will be accounted for their deeds in this life. Belief in this future reality is essential because it helps focus human attention beyond just the immediate worldly life. It encourages moral responsibility, gives purpose to life, and provides assurance that ultimate justice will be served.","arabic":"مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek.","commentary":"This verse marks a significant transition from acknowledging who Allah is (Verses 1-4) to declaring our personal response and commitment to Him. It is a direct and powerful declaration that all acts of worship, submission, and devotion are directed solely to Allah. Similarly, we affirm that we seek help, support, and assistance exclusively from Him. This principle is central to Islamic monotheism, emphasizing that a believer relies completely on Allah, leading to freedom from dependence on or servitude to anything or anyone else.","arabic":"إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Show us the straight way,","commentary":"Following the declaration of devotion and reliance on Allah (Verse 5), this verse becomes a direct plea to Allah for guidance. We ask Allah to guide us to and keep us on the \"straight way.\" This \"straight way\" represents the path of truth, righteousness, and balance that leads to success and well-being in both this life and the hereafter. It is an acknowledgment that humans are inherently in need of divine guidance and that only Allah can provide it. This verse sets the stage for the clarification of this path in the verse that follows.","arabic":"اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.","commentary":"This final verse clarifies the nature of the \"straight way\" sought in the previous verse. It is described as the path of those whom Allah has blessed and favored with His guidance and grace. This path is contrasted with two other paths: the path of those who have incurred Allah's displeasure, often due to rejecting or deviating from the truth after knowing it, and the path of those who have gone astray, often due to ignorance, heedlessness, or misguidance. This verse defines the desired path as one that leads to receiving Allah's grace and protection from deviation and displeasure.","arabic":"صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ"}];
