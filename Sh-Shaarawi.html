    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Alif, Lam, Meem.","commentary":"This verse consists of <strong>three letters from the Arabic alphabet</strong>: *Alif*, *Lam*, and *Mim*. These letters appear at the beginning of several chapters of the Quran. The source notes that these are recited individually with pauses between them. The <strong>meaning of these letters is not definitively known</strong>. It is mentioned that even those who did not believe in the Quran at the time did not criticize these seemingly cryptic openings, suggesting they might have recognized their significance within the Arabic linguistic tradition. This verse serves as a <strong>distinctive opening</strong> to the chapter, prompting reflection before the main themes are introduced in the following verse, which describes \"the Scripture\".","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -","commentary":"This verse introduces the Quran as \"<strong>the Scripture in which there is no doubt</strong>\", highlighting its <strong>certainty and truthfulness</strong>. It further states that this Scripture provides \"<strong>guidance for those who are mindful of God</strong>\". The term \"mindful of God\" (often understood as <strong>being aware of God and striving to live according to their understanding of divine principles</strong>) describes those who can benefit from this guidance. The source explains this guidance as a way to find <strong>protection from divine displeasure</strong>. This verse builds upon the first by identifying the nature and purpose of \"the Scripture.\" It connects to the subsequent verse by beginning to describe the characteristics of those who are \"mindful of God\" and thus receive this guidance.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,","commentary":"This verse starts outlining the characteristics of individuals who are \"mindful of God\" and benefit from the Scripture's guidance. Firstly, they are \"<strong>those who believe in the unseen</strong>\". The \"unseen\" refers to aspects of reality beyond direct human perception, such as <strong>God, angels, and the concept of an afterlife</strong>. Secondly, they \"<strong>establish prayer</strong>,\" indicating a <strong>consistent and proper practice of worship</strong>. Thirdly, they \"<strong>spend out of what We have provided for them</strong>,\" signifying <strong>charitable giving and sharing their resources with others</strong>. This verse elaborates on the qualities of those who are guided by the Scripture mentioned in the previous verse. It leads to the following verse by continuing to list attributes of these believers.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].","commentary":"Continuing the description of the believers, this verse mentions that they \"<strong>believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad]</strong>,\" referring to the Quran as a divine revelation. They also believe in \"<strong>what was revealed before you</strong>,\" indicating <strong>acceptance of earlier scriptures</strong> understood to have been sent by God. Furthermore, they \"<strong>are certain of the Hereafter</strong>,\" signifying a <strong>firm conviction in the concept of life after death, judgment, and accountability for one's actions</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one by further defining the scope of the believers' faith, encompassing the current and previous divine messages, as well as a strong belief in the future reality of the Hereafter. It sets the stage for the next verse by summarizing the positive outcome for those with these characteristics.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.","commentary":"This verse declares the <strong>positive outcome for those who possess the characteristics described in the preceding verses</strong>. It states, \"<strong>Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord</strong>,\" emphasizing that their beliefs and actions are in accordance with divine direction. It concludes by saying, \"<strong>and it is those who are the successful</strong>,\" signifying that they will <strong>achieve a positive and fulfilling outcome</strong>, both in this life and in the context of their faith's teachings about the Hereafter. This verse acts as a <strong>summary and a positive affirmation</strong> for the believers' attributes outlined in the previous verses. It then transitions to describing those who reject this guidance in the following verses.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.","commentary":"This verse marks a shift in focus to describe <strong>those who disbelieve</strong>. It states that for such people, \"<strong>it will not avail them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe</strong>\". This suggests a <strong>state of unwillingness or inability to accept the message</strong>, regardless of whether it is conveyed to them. This verse presents a <strong>contrast to the successful believers</strong> described in the preceding verses. It sets the stage for the following verse, which offers a reason for this lack of belief from the perspective of the text.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنْذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.","commentary":"This verse provides a reason, according to the text, for why those who disbelieve will not believe. It states that \"<strong>God has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil</strong>\". This can be understood metaphorically as a <strong>state of spiritual closure or an unwillingness to perceive and accept the message</strong> being presented to them. As a consequence of this state, \"<strong>for them is a great punishment</strong>\". This verse follows the previous one by offering an explanation for the disbelievers' lack of faith. It then leads into the description of another group: the hypocrites, who outwardly claim belief but inwardly do not.","arabic":"خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ ۖ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَارِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day,\" but they are not believers.","commentary":"This verse introduces a third category of people: <strong>the hypocrites</strong>. It describes them as individuals who \"<strong>say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day,' but they are not believers</strong>\". This highlights a <strong>discrepancy between their outward declarations of faith and their inner convictions</strong>. This group is presented as distinct from both the sincere believers and the outright disbelievers. This verse follows the description of the disbelievers by introducing a more subtle form of non-belief. It leads to the next verse, which delves into the motivations behind this hypocrisy.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the intentions and the consequences of the hypocrites' behavior. It states, \"<strong>They [think to] deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not</strong>\". This suggests that while they aim to mislead, their actions ultimately <strong>only result in their own self-deception</strong>, as they fail to understand the true nature and consequences of their hypocrisy. The source emphasizes the potential danger posed by hypocrites to the community. This verse follows the introduction of the hypocrites in the previous verse by explaining their deceptive nature and the ultimate futility of their actions. It leads to the next verse, which describes their internal state.","arabic":"يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.","commentary":"This verse further describes the <strong>internal condition of the hypocrites</strong>. It states, \"<strong>In their hearts is disease, so God has increased their disease</strong>,\" suggesting a <strong>spiritual sickness or moral corruption that intensifies</strong>. The verse concludes by stating, \"<strong>and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] lie</strong>,\" directly linking their <strong>deceitful behavior to negative consequences</strong>. The source highlights lying as a key characteristic leading to this painful outcome. This verse provides a deeper insight into the internal state and the reasons for the negative outcome described for the hypocrites introduced in the preceding verses. It continues the description of this group before moving on to further details of their behavior and interactions.","arabic":"فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Do not cause corruption on the earth,\" they say, \"We are but reformers.\"","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the hypocrites. It highlights their <strong>response when advised not to cause corruption or disorder in the world</strong>. Instead of acknowledging this, they claim, \"<strong>We are but reformers</strong>\". This suggests a <strong>self-perception of doing good</strong> even when their actions might be perceived negatively by others. This verse follows the description of their deceptive nature and leads into the next verse by directly refuting their claim.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse directly refutes the hypocrites' claim from the previous verse. It states unequivocally, \"<strong>Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters</strong>\". However, it also notes that \"<strong>they do not perceive it</strong>,\" indicating a <strong>lack of self-awareness</strong> regarding the negative impact of their actions. This verse directly responds to the claim made in the preceding verse. It sets the stage for the following verse, which further illustrates their contradictory behavior.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe as the people have believed,\" they say, \"Should we believe as the foolish have believed?\" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.","commentary":"This verse describes another aspect of the hypocrites' attitude. When they are told, \"<strong>Believe as the [other] people have believed</strong>\" (referring to the genuine believers), they respond dismissively, questioning, \"<strong>Should we believe as the fools believe?</strong>\" The verse then counters this by stating, \"<strong>Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know</strong>,\" again highlighting their <strong>misperception and lack of true understanding</strong>. The source clarifies that by \"weak-minded,\" the hypocrites meant the poor and disadvantaged. This verse follows the previous one by showing their scornful attitude towards genuine faith. It leads to the next verse by describing their interactions and associations.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We believe\"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, \"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.\"","commentary":"This verse illustrates the <strong>duplicitous behavior of the hypocrites in their interactions with different groups</strong>. \"<strong>When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'</strong>,\" showing an outward display of faith. However, \"<strong>when they are alone with their evil companions, they say, 'Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers'</strong>,\" revealing their true allegiance and their insincere pretense of belief. This verse follows the previous one by depicting their contradictory behavior in different social contexts. It sets the stage for the next verse, which describes how their mockery will be addressed.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>divine response to the hypocrites' mockery</strong>. \"<strong>God will mock them and increase them in their defiance</strong>,\" suggesting a consequence for their insincerity. The phrase \"God will mock them\" is understood by scholars not as God engaging in ridicule in a human sense, but rather as <strong>causing the hypocrites' own schemes to backfire and result in their humiliation</strong>. As a result, \"<strong>so they will wander blindly</strong>,\" indicating a state of confusion and misguidance. This verse directly follows the depiction of their mocking behavior in the previous verse. It leads to the next verse by describing the outcome of their choice.","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.","commentary":"This verse characterizes the hypocrites' choice as a <strong>detrimental exchange</strong>. \"<strong>Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance</strong>,\" highlighting that they have willingly chosen misguidance over the path of truth. Consequently, \"<strong>so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided</strong>,\" emphasizing the <strong>failure and loss resulting from their decision</strong>. This verse follows the description of their wandering in the previous verse by explaining the nature of their misstep. It sets the stage for the next verse, which uses a parable to further illustrate their condition.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>parable to illustrate the situation of the hypocrites</strong>. It describes someone who \"<strong>kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, God took away its light, and they were left in darkness, unable to see</strong>\". This can be understood as the hypocrites initially having some access to light or understanding (perhaps through their outward association with believers), but then <strong>losing this illumination</strong> due to their insincerity, leaving them in spiritual darkness and confusion. This verse follows the description of their unprofitable transaction in the previous verse by offering a vivid analogy of their state. It leads to the next verse, which continues this figurative description using sensory impairments.","arabic":"مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].","commentary":"This verse continues the figurative description of the hypocrites, portraying them as \"<strong>Deaf, dumb, and blind</strong>\". These are <strong>metaphorical descriptions</strong> indicating their <strong>inability to hear and accept the truth (deaf), their unwillingness to speak the truth (dumb), and their inability to see or understand the clear signs (blind)</strong>. As a consequence of this state, \"<strong>so they will not return [to the right path]</strong>,\" emphasizing their continued straying from guidance. This verse builds upon the parable in the previous verse by further emphasizing their sensory and cognitive impairments in a spiritual sense. It leads to the next verse, which presents another parable to describe their wavering and uncertain condition.","arabic":"صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse offers <strong>another parable</strong> to describe the hypocrites, comparing them to \"<strong>a rainstorm from the sky, within which is darkness, thunder, and lightning</strong>\". This imagery suggests a state of <strong>confusion, fear, and instability</strong>. \"<strong>They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearing death</strong>,\" indicating their anxiety and attempts to avoid the overwhelming reality. The verse concludes with a general statement, \"<strong>But God encompasses the disbelievers [in His knowledge and power]</strong>,\" reminding that God is fully aware of and in control of all. This verse follows the previous one by presenting a different analogy of their precarious and fearful state. It leads to the next verse, which further elaborates on the powerful signs of God.","arabic":"أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَاتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِمْ مِنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse continues the <strong>rainstorm parable</strong> from the previous verse. \"<strong>The lightning almost snatches away their sight</strong>,\" depicting the overwhelming yet temporary flashes of understanding or opportunity. \"<strong>Every time it flashes for them, they walk within it; but when darkness comes upon them, they stand [still]</strong>,\" illustrating their <strong>inconsistent progress and their being stranded in doubt when clarity fades</strong>. The verse concludes by emphasizing <strong>God's power and ability</strong>, stating, \"<strong>And if God had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, God is over all things competent</strong>\". This serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority. This verse directly continues and concludes the second parable describing the hypocrites' fluctuating state. It marks the end of this section describing the different categories of people (believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites) and prepares for a new theme in the subsequent verses.","arabic":"يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُمْ مَشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"21","text":"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>shift in address from the specific groups (believers, disbelievers, hypocrites) to all of humanity</strong>. It begins with \"<strong>O mankind</strong>,\" indicating a universal call. The core message is to \"<strong>worship your Lord, who created you and those before you</strong>,\" emphasizing the <strong>oneness of the Creator and the shared origin of all people</strong>. The purpose of this worship is stated as \"<strong>that you may become righteous</strong>,\" suggesting that following divine guidance leads to a state of moral uprightness. This verse follows the descriptions of different human responses to faith and introduces a direct appeal to all people based on the commonality of creation. It leads to the next verse by highlighting some of the provisions God has made for humanity.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>reasons for the call to worship</strong> in the preceding verse. It highlights <strong>God's role as the provider and sustainer</strong>. It mentions \"<strong>[He] who has made for you the earth a bed and the heaven a ceiling</strong>,\" illustrating the <strong>habitable nature of the earth and the protection of the sky</strong>. It further mentions \"<strong>sent down rain from the sky and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you</strong>,\" emphasizing the <strong>source of sustenance</strong>. Based on these provisions, the verse concludes with a call to <strong>reject associating anything as equal to God</strong>: \"<strong>So do not attribute to God equals while you know [that there is no equal to Him]</strong>.\" This verse builds upon the universal appeal of the previous verse by detailing some of God's creations and blessings for humanity. It leads to the next verse, which addresses those who might doubt the divine origin of the message.","arabic":"الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>direct challenge to those who might question the authenticity of the divine message</strong> revealed to Prophet Muhammad. It begins with \"<strong>And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant</strong>,\" addressing any potential skepticism. The challenge is to \"<strong>produce a single sura like it</strong>\" (a chapter of the Quran), emphasizing the <strong>unique nature and eloquence of the text</strong>. To further underscore the challenge, it invites them to \"<strong>enlist your witnesses other than God</strong>\" for assistance, \"<strong>if you should be truthful</strong>\" in their doubts. This verse follows the previous one by addressing potential doubts about the divine source of the guidance. It leads to the next verse by describing the consequence of failing this challenge. The source notes this is a challenge related to the <strong>inimitable and miraculous nature of the Noble Quran</strong>.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse states the <strong>inevitability of failing the challenge presented in the previous verse</strong>. \"<strong>But if you do not - and you will never be able to</strong>,\" asserts the <strong>incomparable nature of the divine message</strong>. Consequently, it warns of \"<strong>the Fire which is prepared for the disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones</strong>,\" highlighting the <strong>severe consequence for rejecting the truth</strong>. This verse directly follows the challenge of producing a similar chapter in the preceding verse, stating the certain failure of such an attempt. It leads to the next verse by describing the rewards awaiting those who believe and do good deeds.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا وَلَنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus from the consequences of disbelief to the <strong>rewards for those who believe and act righteously</strong>. It instructs to \"<strong>give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow</strong>,\" depicting a state of <strong>eternal bliss and abundance</strong>. Further descriptions include \"<strong>Whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom, they will say, 'This is what we were provided with before.' And they will be given [therein] fruit resembling [what they knew before]</strong>,\" suggesting a <strong>familiarity within the new, perfect environment</strong>. Additionally, \"<strong>and they will have therein pure spouses, and they will abide therein forever</strong>,\" emphasizing <strong>eternal companionship in a state of purity</strong>. This verse follows the warning of punishment in the previous verse by presenting the contrasting reward for believers. It leads to the next verse, which discusses the use of parables in the divine message.","arabic":"وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِزْقًا ۙ قَالُوا هَٰذَا الَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَأُتُوا بِهِ مُتَشَابِهًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ ۖ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, \"What did Allah intend by this as an example?\" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby.

The verse highlights different responses to these examples: \"<strong>And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, 'What did God intend by this example?'</strong>\" This illustrates how <strong>believers find understanding while disbelievers question their significance</strong>. The verse further states that \"<strong>He causes many to stray because of it and guides many thereby. And He causes none to stray except the defiantly disobedient</strong>,\" indicating that <strong>guidance and misguidance are linked to one's disposition and willingness to accept the truth</strong>. This verse follows the description of Paradise by explaining a method used in conveying divine wisdom. It leads to the next verse by describing a key characteristic of those who are misguided.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth.

They are identified as those \"<strong>[Who break the covenant of God after its confirmation and cut that which God has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth</strong>.\" This includes <strong>violating agreements made with God, disrupting social harmony, and spreading disorder</strong>. The verse concludes by stating, \"<strong>Those are the losers</strong>,\" emphasizing the <strong>negative outcome of such actions</strong>. This verse follows the discussion on guidance and misguidance by specifying the attributes of those who go astray. It leads to the next verse, which speaks about the creation of humanity and the universe.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَنْقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>logical argument against disbelief based on the cycle of life, death, and resurrection</strong>. It questions, \"<strong>How can you disbelieve in God when you were lifeless and He brought you to life</strong>,\" highlighting the <strong>initial act of creation</strong>. It further states, \"<strong>then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and to Him you will be returned</strong>,\" outlining the <strong>future events of death and resurrection, and the ultimate return to God</strong>. This verse follows the description of the characteristics of the disobedient by directly addressing the act of disbelief itself. It leads to the next verse, which elaborates on God's creation for humanity.","arabic":"كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ ۖ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth.

The verse concludes with \"<strong>and He is Knowing of all things</strong>,\" affirming <strong>God's perfect awareness of everything</strong>. This verse follows the argument against disbelief by further detailing God's creative acts and knowledge.

It recounts the conversation between God and the angels: \"<strong>And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, 'Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.' They said, 'Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your purity and sanctify You?'</strong>\" This highlights the <strong>angels' initial questioning based on their perception of the potential for human wrongdoing</strong>. God's response, \"<strong>Indeed, I know that which you do not know</strong>,\" indicates that <strong>divine wisdom encompasses aspects beyond the angels' understanding</strong>, likely including humanity's potential for good and spiritual growth. This verse follows the description of God's creation of the earth and heavens by focusing on the creation of humankind and their role on Earth. It sets the stage for further details about Adam's creation and his story.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"30","text":"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\" They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?\" Allah said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a dialogue between God and the angels. God informs the angels of His intention to create a <strong>\"successive authority\" (often understood as humankind)</strong> on Earth. The angels question this decision, expressing their concern that humans will cause <strong>corruption and bloodshed</strong>. They contrast this with their own constant <strong>declaration of God's perfection and holiness</strong>. God responds by stating that <strong>He knows things that the angels do not know</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse sets the stage for the creation of humanity and suggests a purpose for their existence on Earth as a form of authority or stewardship. It also introduces the idea that God's wisdom encompasses more than what might immediately appear to be the case. The following verses elaborate on the creation of Adam and the knowledge bestowed upon him.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"","commentary":"Following the announcement of creating a successor on Earth, this verse describes God <strong>teaching Adam \"the names\" of all things</strong>. The exact nature of these \"names\" is not fully explained, but it signifies the granting of <strong>knowledge and the ability to classify and understand the creation</strong>. After bestowing this knowledge upon Adam, God presents these things to the angels, challenging them to <strong>name them if their initial concerns about humankind were justified</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse highlights a key distinction between humanity and the angels: the capacity for knowledge and understanding. It implies that this knowledge is a crucial aspect of humanity's role as a successive authority on Earth, a point of wisdom that the angels may not have fully grasped in the previous verse. The next verse shows the angels' response to this challenge.","arabic":"وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.\"","commentary":"In response to God's challenge, the angels acknowledge their <strong>limitation in knowledge</strong>, stating that they only know what God has taught them. They <strong>glorify God</strong> and affirm His attributes as <strong>\"the Knowing, the Wise,\"</strong> recognizing His comprehensive understanding.\r\n\r\nThis verse demonstrates the angels' humility and their acceptance of God's superior knowledge and wisdom. It serves as a contrast to the potential for human arrogance and highlights the divine source of all knowledge. This acknowledgement from the angels reinforces the idea from the previous verse that the knowledge given to Adam was a significant endowment. The subsequent verse details God's instruction to Adam.","arabic":"قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"33","text":"He said, \"O Adam, inform them of their names.\" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\"","commentary":"Here, God instructs <strong>Adam to inform the angels of the names</strong> of the things presented. When Adam successfully does so, God reminds the angels of His earlier statement that <strong>He knows the \"unseen\" (the unknown aspects of the heavens and the earth)</strong> and that <strong>He is aware of both what is revealed and what is concealed</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse emphasizes God's all-encompassing knowledge, which includes both the apparent and the hidden. Adam's ability to name the things demonstrates the unique knowledge he was granted, validating God's initial intention to create a successive authority with this capacity. The verse also subtly addresses the angels' earlier concerns by showing a wisdom in God's plan that they did not initially perceive. The verse that follows describes God's command to the angels regarding Adam.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.","commentary":"Following the demonstration of Adam's knowledge, God commands the <strong>angels to prostrate before Adam</strong>. This act of prostration is a sign of <strong>respect and honor</strong> towards Adam. The verse states that all the angels obeyed this command, <strong>except for Iblees (often known as Satan)</strong>. Iblees <strong>refused</strong> out of <strong>arrogance</strong>, believing himself to be superior, and thus <strong>became one of those who deny or disobey God's commands</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse marks a significant event, highlighting the special status given to humanity through Adam. Iblees's refusal introduces the theme of disobedience and pride, which will play a crucial role in the subsequent narrative of humanity's journey. The following verse details God's instructions to Adam and his wife in Paradise.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will.

They are given <strong>permission to eat freely and abundantly</strong> from anywhere within Paradise. However, God places a <strong>specific prohibition</strong>, commanding them <strong>not to approach \"this [one] tree,\"</strong> warning that disobedience would result in them <strong>becoming \"among the wrongdoers\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse establishes a state of initial ease and provision for humanity but also introduces the concept of <strong>divine command and the potential for transgression</strong>. The specific tree is not identified in detail, serving as a symbolic test of obedience. This sets the stage for the subsequent events involving temptation and the consequences of disobedience. The next verse describes the temptation by Satan.","arabic":"وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been.

Through temptation, they disobeyed God's command regarding the tree, leading to their <strong>removal from the state of ease and abundance</strong> they had been in . As a consequence, God commands them to <strong>\"descend\" to Earth</strong>, where they would be in a state of <strong>enmity towards one another</strong> (referring to the conflict between good and evil, or between different groups of people) . They are also informed that Earth will be a <strong>place of settlement and enjoyment, but only for a limited time</strong> .\r\n\r\nThis verse explains the transition of humanity from Paradise to Earth as a result of succumbing to temptation and disobeying a divine command . It introduces the challenges and conflicts that will characterize human life on Earth, as well as the temporary nature of earthly existence. The following verse describes Adam's repentance .","arabic":"فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ ۖ وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.","commentary":"Following their descent to Earth, <strong>Adam received \"some words\" from his Lord</strong> . These words are generally understood as a <strong>prayer or supplication for forgiveness</strong>, although the exact wording is not specified in this verse . God, in His mercy, <strong>accepted Adam's repentance</strong> . The verse concludes by emphasizing God's attributes as <strong>\"the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful,\"</strong> highlighting His willingness to forgive those who sincerely turn back to Him .\r\n\r\nThis verse introduces the important theme of <strong>repentance and divine forgiveness</strong> . Despite their mistake, Adam and his wife were given an opportunity to seek forgiveness, and God's acceptance of this repentance demonstrates His boundless mercy. This provides a message of hope for humanity, suggesting that mistakes can be rectified through sincere remorse and seeking forgiveness. The subsequent verse outlines further guidance from God .","arabic":"فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"38","text":"We said, \"Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verses, God reiterates the command to <strong>descend from Paradise</strong> . However, He also provides a crucial promise: <strong>when guidance comes from Him</strong>, those who <strong>follow this guidance will have no fear in the future nor will they grieve over the past</strong> .\r\n\r\nThis verse establishes a fundamental principle for humanity's life on Earth: <strong>divine guidance will be provided, and following it is the path to security and peace of mind</strong> . It implies that despite the challenges of earthly existence, God has not abandoned humanity but has offered a way to navigate life without succumbing to ultimate fear and sorrow. The verse that follows describes the consequences for those who reject this guidance .","arabic":"قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ مِنِّي هُدًى فَمَنْ تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\"","commentary":"In contrast to those who follow divine guidance, this verse describes the fate of <strong>those who disbelieve (reject faith) and deny God's signs (evidences and revelations)</strong> . They are described as <strong>\"companions of the Fire,\"</strong> meaning they will inhabit the hellfire, and <strong>\"they will abide therein eternally\"</strong> .\r\n\r\nThis verse presents the consequence of rejecting divine guidance and denying God's messages . It highlights the importance of belief and acceptance of the \"signs\" that God provides as a means of guidance. This verse serves as a clear contrast to the promise of peace and security offered to those who follow God's guidance in the preceding verse. The next verse shifts focus to the Children of Israel, reminding them of past blessings .","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.","commentary":"Here, the address shifts to the <strong>\"Children of Israel,\"</strong> reminding them of the <strong>\"favor\" (blessings and privileges)</strong> that God had bestowed upon them in the past . They are called to <strong>\"fulfill My covenant,\"</strong> which implies adhering to the divine agreements and laws given to them . In return, God promises to <strong>\"fulfill your covenant,\"</strong> suggesting the rewards and blessings associated with obedience . The verse concludes with a direct command to <strong>\"fear only Me,\"</strong> emphasizing the importance of God-consciousness and accountability to Him alone .\r\n\r\nThis verse marks a transition in the Surah, moving from the general narrative of creation and guidance for humanity to a specific address to the Children of Israel . It highlights the concept of a covenant or agreement between God and a particular group, emphasizing the responsibilities and rewards associated with this relationship. This sets the stage for further discussions about the history and obligations of the Children of Israel in the subsequent verses.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ"},{"verse":"41","text":"And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.","commentary":"This verse follows the previous one which reminded the Children of Israel of their covenant and urged them to have reverence. Verse 41 specifically instructs them <strong>not to obscure or distort the truth</strong> that they possess, nor to conceal it knowingly. This suggests a responsibility to uphold and accurately present the knowledge they have been given. The verse that follows (verse 42 in the source, but it quotes verse 43 of the Quran) continues with instructions on how to conduct themselves, including performing prayer and acts of charity.","arabic":"وَآمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوا أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَإِيَّايَ فَاتَّقُونِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].","commentary":"This verse is the same as the previous one in the source material. It emphasizes the importance of <strong>honesty and integrity in conveying knowledge</strong>. The connection to the preceding verse (40 in the Quran, 41 in the source) is that after reminding them of their obligations, this verse specifically addresses the ethical responsibility of those who possess knowledge. The subsequent verse (43 in the Quran, mentioned as the next step in the source) focuses on positive actions like prayer and charity.","arabic":"وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].","commentary":"Following the instructions not to distort or hide the truth, this verse (which is verse 43 of the Quran but discussed after verse 42 in the source) outlines <strong>positive actions of worship and social responsibility</strong>. It mentions \"prayer,\" \"spending in charity,\" and \"bowing down with those who bow.\" These are presented as integral parts of a righteous way of life. This verse connects to the previous ones by offering concrete practices that should accompany the adherence to truth. The next verse (44 in the Quran) questions the inconsistency of telling others to do what is right while neglecting it oneself.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>reproach for hypocrisy</strong>. It addresses those who instruct others to do good while failing to act upon their own teachings, despite being familiar with scripture. The question \"Have you no sense?\" highlights the perceived illogical nature of such behavior. This verse follows the encouragement to perform good deeds (prayer and charity) and presents a challenge to those who preach but do not practice. The subsequent verse (45 in the Quran) suggests seeking help through steadfastness and prayer.","arabic":"أَتَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]","commentary":"After criticizing the inconsistency of preaching without practicing, this verse advises seeking <strong>support through \"steadfast patience\" and \"prayer\"</strong> in facing difficulties and fulfilling obligations. It also notes that this can be challenging except for \"the humble in spirit,\" implying that humility facilitates perseverance and devotion. This verse provides a means to overcome the difficulties implied in the previous verse. The verse that follows (46 in the Quran) describes the characteristics of the humble, mentioning their belief in meeting their Lord.","arabic":"وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.","commentary":"This verse further elaborates on the <strong>characteristics of \"the humble in spirit\"</strong> mentioned in the preceding verse. A key aspect of their humility is their firm belief in a future meeting with their Lord (often understood as accountability in the afterlife) and their eventual return to Him. This belief serves as a motivation for patience and prayer. This verse connects by explaining who can readily follow the advice of the previous verse. The next verse (47 in the Quran) shifts back to addressing the Children of Israel, reminding them of the blessings they received.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>return to addressing the Children of Israel directly</strong>, reminding them of the <strong>\"blessings\" and \"favours\"</strong> bestowed upon them. This serves as a call to reflect on their history and the divine grace they have experienced. This verse follows the description of the humble believers and redirects the focus to the specific community being addressed. The subsequent verse (48 in the Quran) warns about a day when no soul will avail another. The source notes that some might perceive this as a repetition of earlier reminders, but it argues against this, suggesting different nuances.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"Following the reminder of past blessings, this verse serves as a <strong>solemn warning about a future day (often interpreted as the Day of Judgment)</strong>. It emphasizes individual accountability, stating that on this day, <strong>no soul will be able to help another</strong>, neither through intercession nor by offering compensation, and no external help will be available. This verse connects to the previous one by highlighting the responsibility that comes with having received blessings. The verse that follows (49 in the Quran) recounts a specific historical instance of deliverance for the Children of Israel. The source also notes a similarity with verse 123 of the Quran but highlights differences in the latter part of the verses.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.","commentary":"The provided excerpt for verse 49 is incomplete and does not contain the full verse. However, it begins by stating that <strong>God recounts an \"incident\"</strong> in the Quran. Based on the surrounding verses (48 and 50), this incident is related to the <strong>Children of Israel and their deliverance from Pharaoh</strong>. This verse connects to the warning about individual accountability by recalling a time when God's intervention had a significant impact on their history. The next verse (50 in the Quran) continues this recounting of past events, specifically mentioning the parting of the sea.","arabic":"وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَاكُمْ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلَاءٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"50","text":"And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.","commentary":"This verse continues the historical narrative begun in the previous verse, recalling a <strong>specific act of divine intervention</strong> in favor of the Children of Israel. It mentions the parting of the sea, their subsequent <strong>rescue</strong>, and the <strong>drowning of Pharaoh's people</strong> while the Israelites witnessed it. This event serves as a powerful reminder of God's power and his favor towards them in the past. This verse directly follows the introduction of the historical incident and leads into further recounting of events in their history.","arabic":"وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ الْبَحْرَ فَأَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse refers to a time when <strong>Moses was in seclusion for forty nights</strong>. In his absence, the Children of Israel <strong>took to worshipping a calf</strong>, which is described as a wrongdoing on their part. This verse connects to the previous one by continuing the historical account of the Children of Israel after their deliverance from Pharaoh. The verse that follows (verse 52 in the Quran, not explicitly discussed in this section of the source) would likely discuss the aftermath of this event and the subsequent forgiveness. The key point here is the <strong>lapse in faith</strong> during a time of divine communication.","arabic":"وَإِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.","commentary":"While this specific verse isn't directly commented on in the provided source within this range, it logically follows verse 51. After the Children of Israel's error in worshipping the calf, <strong>divine forgiveness was granted to them</strong>, with the expectation that they would then be grateful. This verse bridges the account of their wrongdoing and the subsequent guidance given to Moses, as mentioned in the next verse. The underlying theme is the <strong>availability of forgiveness after mistakes</strong>.","arabic":"ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنْكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.","commentary":"The source states, \"God the Most High says, And when We gave Moses the Book and the standard of distinction [between right and wrong] meaning that the fact and eat therefrom plentifully wherever you may wish (al-Baqara: 35)\". Although the source incorrectly quotes verse 35, it indicates that <strong>the giving of the Scripture (the Torah) to Moses was intended as a source of guidance</strong> for the Children of Israel, providing a <strong>criterion to distinguish between right and wrong</strong>. This verse follows the mention of forgiveness, highlighting a renewed opportunity for guidance. The next verse (verse 54) describes a specific commandment given to them.","arabic":"وَإِذْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَالْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.\" Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.","commentary":"According to the source, Moses instructed his people, \"Repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [i.e., the wrongdoers among you] - that will be better for you in the sight of your Creator. Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful\". This verse describes a <strong>difficult commandment given to the Children of Israel as a means of repentance</strong> for worshipping the calf. It emphasizes the seriousness of their transgression and the subsequent <strong>acceptance of their repentance</strong> by their Creator, highlighting divine mercy. This verse follows the giving of the Scripture and illustrates a specific instance where adherence to divine guidance was tested. The next verse (verse 55) continues the narrative of their interactions with Moses.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ بِاتِّخَاذِكُمُ الْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوا إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ عِنْدَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"55","text":"And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright\"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.","commentary":"The source mentions, \"And when you said, O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright. So the thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on\". This verse recounts an instance where the Children of Israel <strong>demanded to see God directly</strong> as a condition for their belief in Moses. As a consequence, <strong>a powerful event (referred to as a thunderbolt) overtook them</strong>. This verse follows the account of their repentance, illustrating a further instance of their skepticism and the divine response. The subsequent verse (verse 56, not explicitly discussed here) would describe their revival after this event.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.","commentary":"While this specific verse is not directly commented on in the provided source within this range, it logically follows verse 55. After the \"thunderbolt\" struck them, <strong>they were brought back to life</strong>. This revival was so that they \"might be grateful\" for this second chance. This verse acts as a bridge between their demand to see God and the subsequent blessings bestowed upon them, as mentioned in the following verse. It underscores the theme of <strong>divine mercy and the opportunity for gratitude</strong>.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.","commentary":"The source states, \"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], Eat from the pure [i.e., lawful] things with which We have provided you. And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves\". This verse describes <strong>divine provisions and protection</strong> granted to the Children of Israel. They were given shade by clouds and provided with \"manna and quails\" as sustenance, with the instruction to partake of these pure provisions. The verse also notes that their lack of gratitude or obedience did not harm God but rather <strong>harmed themselves</strong>. This follows their revival and illustrates further ways in which they were favored. The next verse (verse 58) recounts another commandment given to them regarding entering a city.","arabic":"وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ وَالسَّلْوَىٰ ۖ كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ ۖ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"And [recall] when We said, \"Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"","commentary":"The source refers to this verse, stating, \"God the Most High says, Enter this city, and the city mentioned here is Jerusalem, or Palestine, or Jordan. The True Lord the Most High then says, and enter the gate with prostrations, and say, Forgiveness, and We will forgive your sins and increase those who do good\". This verse recounts a <strong>divine command to enter a specific city (identified as Jerusalem, Palestine, or Jordan)</strong> and to partake of its provisions freely. They were instructed to enter the gate humbly, saying \"Forgiveness,\" with the promise of <strong>pardon for their sins and increased rewards for good deeds</strong>. This follows the provision of food and shelter, presenting them with another opportunity for obedience and righteousness. The subsequent verse (verse 59) describes their disobedience to this command.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ادْخُلُوا هَٰذِهِ الْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُوا مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَدًا وَادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُولُوا حِطَّةٌ نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَايَاكُمْ ۚ وَسَنَزِيدُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"59","text":"But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.","commentary":"While not explicitly commented on in the provided source within this range, this verse logically follows verse 58. It describes how \"those who wronged\" among the Children of Israel <strong>disobeyed the command</strong> to enter the city humbly and say \"Forgiveness.\" Instead, they <strong>altered the word</strong> that was commanded. As a result of their defiant disobedience, <strong>a punishment from the sky was sent down upon them</strong>. This verse highlights the consequences of failing to follow divine instructions after being given clear guidance and opportunities for forgiveness. It sets the stage for the next verse (verse 60), which recounts another event in their history.","arabic":"فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا قَوْلًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا رِجْزًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people knew its watering place. \"Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"","commentary":"The source mentions, \"God the Most High then says, Remember when We asked Moses to strike the stone and twelve springs gushed forth from it, and We told them to eat and drink but not to cause corruption on the earth\". This verse recalls an instance where <strong>Moses prayed for water for his people</strong>, and in response, God commanded him to <strong>strike a stone with his staff, whereupon twelve springs gushed forth</strong>. This miracle provided water for each of their twelve tribes. They were instructed to partake of God's provisions and <strong>not to cause corruption on the earth</strong>. This verse follows the account of their punishment for disobedience and showcases another example of divine provision and guidance in their history. The narrative will likely continue with further accounts of their interactions and tests.","arabic":"وَإِذِ اسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبْ بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ ۖ فَانْفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا ۖ قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَشْرَبَهُمْ ۖ كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا مِنْ رِزْقِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"61","text":"And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food.

Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.\" And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.","commentary":"This verse recounts a time when the <strong>Children of Israel expressed dissatisfaction with the single type of food</strong> they were receiving and asked Moses to pray to God for a variety of agricultural produce. Moses responded by suggesting that they were seeking something of lesser value compared to what they had been provided. The verse concludes by stating that they were <strong>afflicted with humiliation and wretchedness and incurred divine displeasure</strong> because they consistently rejected divine signs and unjustly killed prophets, attributing this to their disobedience and transgression. This verse follows the account of the twelve springs, illustrating a further instance of the Children of Israel's interactions and their response to divine provisions. The subsequent verse (verse 62) shifts focus to a broader principle regarding different faith communities.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نَصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْ بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّائِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا ۖ قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ۚ اهْبِطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَا سَأَلْتُمْ ۗ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْا وَكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>general principle concerning different faith communities</strong>. It mentions \"those who believed\" (understood within the context of the Quran as Muslims), \"the Jews,\" \"the Christians,\" and \"the Sabeans.\" The verse states that <strong>whoever among these groups truly believes in God and the Last Day and does what is right will receive their reward from God, and they will have no fear nor sorrow</strong>. This verse follows the specific historical account of the Children of Israel and broadens the scope to address the idea of salvation and reward based on genuine faith and righteous actions, regardless of their specific religious affiliation before the coming of Islam. The next verse (verse 63) returns to the specific narrative of the Children of Israel and the covenant made with them.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالنَّصَارَىٰ وَالصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"","commentary":"This verse recalls when God <strong>made a covenant with the Children of Israel and raised a mountain above them</strong>, emphasizing the seriousness of the commitment. They were commanded to <strong>take the divine guidance given to them with determination and to remember its teachings</strong> so that they might become righteous. This verse reconnects to the historical narrative of the Children of Israel after the general statement in the previous verse. The verse that follows (verse 64) describes their subsequent actions after this covenant. The key point here is the <strong>importance of commitment and adherence to divine guidance</strong>.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُوا مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.","commentary":"This verse states that <strong>after the covenant was made, the Children of Israel turned away</strong> from their commitment. It highlights that <strong>it was only due to God's favor and mercy that they were not among the losers</strong>. This verse directly follows the mention of the covenant in the previous verse, illustrating the human tendency to stray even after making solemn promises and receiving clear guidance. The subsequent verse (verse 65) recounts another specific event in their history as a consequence of their turning away. The underlying theme is the <strong>importance of divine grace in preventing negative consequences</strong>.","arabic":"ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُمْ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"","commentary":"This verse refers to a specific incident where some among the Children of Israel <strong>violated the sanctity of the Sabbath</strong>. As a consequence of their transgression, God decreed, \"Be you apes, despised.\" This verse provides a concrete example of the consequences of disobeying divine commandments and follows the general statement about turning away in the previous verse. The next verse (verse 66) explains the purpose of this punishment as a deterrent and a lesson. The key point is the <strong>seriousness of violating religious obligations</strong>.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ الَّذِينَ اعْتَدَوْا مِنْكُمْ فِي السَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah.","commentary":"This verse explains the <strong>purpose behind the punishment</strong> inflicted upon those who violated the Sabbath. It states that this event was made a <strong>deterrent punishment</strong> for those who witnessed it and for subsequent generations. It also serves as a <strong>lesson for those who are mindful of God</strong>. This verse directly follows the account of the punishment in the previous verse, providing insight into the wisdom behind such events in religious narratives. The subsequent verse (verse 67) introduces a new episode in the story of the Children of Israel involving Moses. The overarching theme is the <strong>didactic nature of historical accounts in conveying moral and spiritual lessons</strong>.","arabic":"فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a new episode in the narrative of the Children of Israel, recalling when <strong>Moses informed his people that God commanded them to slaughter a cow</strong>. Their immediate reaction was to question Moses, asking if he was making fun of them. Moses responded by seeking refuge in God from being among the ignorant. This verse follows the lesson drawn from the Sabbath incident and introduces a new test of obedience for the Children of Israel. The verse that follows (verse 68) describes their further inquiries about the nature of the cow. The key point here is the <strong>initial skepticism and questioning of a clear divine command</strong>.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُوا بَقَرَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُوًا ۖ قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[Allah] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.\"","commentary":"Continuing the story of the cow, the Children of Israel asked Moses to <strong>call upon God to clarify the characteristics of the cow</strong>. Moses relayed God's response that <strong>it should be a cow that is neither old nor very young but of median age</strong>, and he urged them to follow the command. This verse directly follows their initial questioning in the previous verse, showing their reluctance to comply with a seemingly simple instruction and their tendency to seek excessive detail. The next verse (verse 69) shows them asking for even more specific details. The underlying theme is the <strong>importance of prompt and willing obedience to divine commands</strong>.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا فَارِضٌ وَلَا بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَافْعَلُوا مَا تُؤْمَرُونَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.' \"","commentary":"The Children of Israel persisted in seeking more details about the cow and asked Moses to inquire about its <strong>color</strong>. Moses informed them that God said <strong>it should be a bright yellow cow, pleasing to beholders</strong>. This verse continues their pattern of asking numerous questions, further delaying their compliance with the original command. It follows their inquiry about the cow's age in the previous verse. The subsequent verse (verse 70) shows them asking for even more clarification, indicating their continued hesitation. The key point here is the <strong>progression of their questioning, moving from general characteristics to specific details</strong>.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَاءُ فَاقِعٌ لَوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ النَّاظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allah wills, will be guided.\"","commentary":"In their continued reluctance, the Children of Israel asked Moses to <strong>further clarify the cow</strong>, stating that all cows looked alike to them. They added that <strong>if God willed, they would be guided</strong> to the correct one. This verse marks the culmination of their detailed inquiries about the cow. It follows their question about the cow's color in the previous verse, highlighting their persistent hesitation and the increasing complexity of their requests. The narrative then proceeds (though not in this specific range) to describe the eventual sacrifice of the cow, indicating that despite their numerous questions, they did eventually comply. The underlying theme is the <strong>potential for excessive questioning to hinder simple obedience</strong>.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ الْبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّا إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' \" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.","commentary":"This verse continues the story of the cow and recounts Moses further clarifying God's command. He stated that the cow should be <strong>neither trained for plowing nor for watering fields, it should be sound and without blemish, and not spotted</strong>. Upon hearing this detailed description, the Children of Israel acknowledged that Moses had now brought the clear truth. The verse concludes by mentioning that <strong>they then slaughtered the cow, but they were hesitant and almost did not perform the act</strong>, highlighting their continued reluctance despite the clear command. This verse follows their previous requests for clarification about the cow, showing how their persistent questioning led to a very specific description. The subsequent verse (verse 72) introduces a new incident related to a killing that occurred among them. The key point here is the <strong>increased specificity of the command and the Children of Israel's eventual, though reluctant, obedience</strong>.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ الْأَرْضَ وَلَا تَسْقِي الْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لَا شِيَةَ فِيهَا ۚ قَالُوا الْآنَ جِئْتَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing.","commentary":"This verse shifts to a new event in the history of the Children of Israel. It recalls a time when <strong>they had killed a person and then disputed amongst themselves about the identity of the killer</strong>. The verse states that <strong>God would reveal what they were trying to hide</strong>. This verse follows the narrative of the cow sacrifice, moving from a test of obedience to a revelation of a hidden crime. The next verse (verse 73) describes how God instructed them to solve the issue of the slain person. The connection here is that after the detailed instructions regarding the cow, this verse highlights God's knowledge of hidden matters and His ability to bring truth to light.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْسًا فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا ۖ وَاللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"So, We said, \"Strike the slain man with part of it.\" Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.","commentary":"Following the disclosure of the concealed killing, this verse recounts God's instruction: <strong>to strike the dead man with a part of the slaughtered cow</strong>. The verse then states that <strong>in this way, God brings the dead to life</strong>, and He shows them His signs so that they might understand. This verse directly follows the account of the murder and the dispute, presenting a miraculous solution to reveal the truth. The subsequent verses (verses 74 onwards) describe the subsequent reaction of the Children of Israel and the state of their hearts. The key point here is the <strong>demonstration of God's power to bring life to the dead as a sign and a means of revealing the truth</strong>, meant to encourage reflection.","arabic":"فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُحْيِي اللَّهُ الْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah.

It states that <strong>their hearts became hardened, likened to stones or even harder</strong>. The verse elaborates by pointing out that some stones allow rivers to flow, others split open to release water, and some even fall down out of reverence for God. It concludes by stating that <strong>God is aware of their actions</strong>. This verse follows the miraculous event of the dead man being brought back to life, highlighting the lack of lasting impact on their hearts and their continued spiritual hardness. The subsequent verse (verse 75) addresses Moses' expectation that they would believe. The main idea here is the <strong>severity of spiritual hardness that prevents people from being moved by even clear signs</strong>.","arabic":"ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَاءُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?","commentary":"This verse questions whether the believers should <strong>expect that the Children of Israel would believe</strong>, considering that a group among them used to <strong>hear the words of God and then deliberately distort them after understanding their meaning</strong>. This verse reflects on the expectation of faith from the Children of Israel, given their history of tampering with divine messages. It follows the description of their hardened hearts and sets the context for their interactions with the divine word. The next verse (verse 76) describes their hypocritical behavior when interacting with believers. The key point is the <strong>criticism of those who knowingly alter and misrepresent divine teachings</strong>.","arabic":"أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>hypocritical behavior of some among the People of the Book (specifically referenced as Jews elsewhere in the text) when they encountered believers</strong>. They would claim, \"<strong>We have believed</strong>.\" However, when they were alone with each other, they would advise, \"<strong>Do not tell them (the believers) what God has revealed to you, so that they can use it to argue against you before your Lord.</strong>\" The verse concludes with the rhetorical question, \"<strong>Have you not considered?</strong>\" This verse follows the criticism of those who distort divine words and illustrates another form of their deception and manipulation. The subsequent verse (verse 77) affirms God's knowledge of both their concealed and revealed actions. The main idea is the <strong>exposure of their duplicity and their fear of the truth being used against them</strong>.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوا أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُمْ بِمَا فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَاجُّوكُمْ بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"But do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?","commentary":"This verse poses a question to those who act hypocritically: <strong>Do they not know that God is fully aware of everything they conceal and everything they reveal?</strong> This verse directly follows the description of their dual behavior in the previous verse, emphasizing God's comprehensive knowledge of their inner thoughts and outward actions. The next verse (verse 78) describes another characteristic of some among them – their reliance on mere assumptions and conjecture. The key point is the <strong>reassurance that nothing is hidden from divine knowledge, serving as a warning against deceit</strong>.","arabic":"أَوَلَا يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.","commentary":"This verse describes another group among the People of the Book, referring to them as <strong>unlettered ones who have no real knowledge of the Scripture except through assumptions and wishful thinking</strong>. They rely solely on conjecture and speculation. This verse follows the affirmation of God's knowledge and highlights the ignorance and unfounded beliefs of some within their community. The subsequent verse (verse 79) condemns those who deliberately misrepresent the scriptures for personal gain. The main idea is the <strong>criticism of those who follow baseless desires and conjectures instead of genuine knowledge of the divine teachings</strong>.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.","commentary":"This verse issues a strong warning: \"<strong>Woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands and then claim, 'This is from God,' in order to gain some small worldly benefit.</strong>\" The verse repeats the condemnation, stating, \"<strong>Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.</strong>\" This verse directly follows the description of the unlettered ones who rely on conjecture and addresses those who intentionally fabricate or alter the scriptures for their own gain. The next verse (verse 80) discusses their false claim about the limited duration of Hellfire. The key point is the <strong>severe condemnation of those who intentionally distort divine scriptures for personal advantage</strong>.","arabic":"فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a claim made by some among the People of the Book, stating that \"<strong>the Fire (of Hell) will never touch us except for a few days.</strong>\" God commands the Prophet to challenge this assertion by asking, \"<strong>Have you taken a covenant with God (regarding this)? For if so, God would never break His covenant. Or do you say about God that which you do not know?</strong>\" This verse follows the condemnation of those who manipulate scripture and tackles another false belief they held. The subsequent verses (verse 81 onwards) will describe the reality of the consequences for those who do evil. The main idea is the <strong>rejection of their unfounded belief about the limited duration of punishment and a questioning of their authority to make such claims about God</strong>.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَةً ۚ قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ عَهْدًا فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ ۖ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse follows the discussion of the People of the Book claiming that the Hellfire would only touch them for a few days. This verse presents a different view, stating that <strong>those who commit evil deeds and whose sins encompass them will be the inhabitants of the Fire, remaining there permanently</strong>. It acts as a <strong>correction or clarification</strong> of the previous claim. The subsequent verse will contrast this with the state of those who believe and do good deeds.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse <strong>contrasts directly with the previous verse</strong>. It describes the <strong>opposite outcome for those who believe and perform righteous actions</strong>. They will be the inhabitants of the Garden (Paradise), where they will remain. This structure of presenting contrasting outcomes – punishment for wrongdoing and reward for good deeds – is a common feature in this text.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.","commentary":"This verse shifts the focus to a <strong>specific covenant (agreement) that was made with the Children of Israel</strong>. It outlines several key obligations within this covenant:\r\n- <strong>Worshipping only God (monotheism)</strong>.\r\n- <strong>Kindness and good treatment towards parents, relatives, orphans, and the needy</strong>.\r\n- <strong>Speaking kindly to all people</strong>.\r\n- <strong>Establishing prayer</strong>.\r\n- <strong>Paying the poor-due (charity)</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe verse then states that <strong>most of the Children of Israel turned away from this covenant</strong>, except for a few. This verse sets the stage for the following verses which will elaborate on their actions of breaking this covenant.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ لَا تَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed each other's blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the <strong>covenant taken with the Children of Israel</strong>, focusing on two specific prohibitions:\r\n- <strong>Not shedding the blood of one another (not killing each other)</strong>.\r\n- <strong>Not evicting one another from their homes</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe verse notes that the Children of Israel <strong>confirmed this covenant and bore witness to it</strong>. This sets up a contrast with the subsequent verse, which describes their actions that contradicted this very covenant.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لَا تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ وَلَا تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>stark contradiction in the actions of the Children of Israel compared to the covenant they agreed to</strong> in the previous verse. It highlights that they were:\r\n- <strong>Killing one another.</strong>\r\n- <strong>Driving some of their own people out of their homes.</strong>\r\n- <strong>Supporting one another in sin and aggression against their own people.</strong>\r\n- <strong>Ransoming captives</strong> (which was a seemingly good deed), <strong>even though they were forbidden from driving them out initially.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rhetorical question: <strong>\"Do you then believe in part of the Book and reject part?\"</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>those who act in this inconsistent manner will face disgrace in this life and the harshest torment in the Hereafter</strong>, emphasizing that God is aware of their actions.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِنْ يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ ۚ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ ۚ فَمَا جَزَاءُ مَنْ يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"This verse explains the <strong>underlying reason for the behavior described in the previous verses</strong>. It states that the Children of Israel <strong>\"buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter\"</strong>. This means they are prioritizing temporary worldly gains and desires over the eternal rewards of the Hereafter. Consequently, <strong>their torment will not be lessened, and they will receive no help</strong>. This verse serves as a <strong>judgment on their actions</strong> and their misplaced priorities.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ ۖ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.","commentary":"This verse recounts the history of divine guidance sent to the Children of Israel through various prophets. It mentions that <strong>Moses was given the Book (Torah), followed by a succession of messengers, and that Jesus, son of Mary, was given clear proofs and strengthened with the Holy Spirit</strong>. The verse then poses a rhetorical question about their consistent reaction to these messengers: <strong>\"So, whenever a messenger came to you with something your souls did not like, did you glory in your arrogance, rejecting some and killing others?\"</strong>. This highlights a pattern of <strong>disbelief, arrogance, and even violence towards the prophets</strong> who brought them messages they did not want to accept. The phrase \"gloried in your arrogance\" suggests they took pride in rejecting divine guidance.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ ۖ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.","commentary":"This verse describes a <strong>statement made by the Children of Israel: \"Our hearts are sealed.\"</strong>. This could be interpreted as a claim that they are incapable of understanding or accepting new messages. However, the verse <strong>refutes this claim</strong>, stating <strong>\"No, but God has cursed them for their disbelief; so little do they believe\"</strong>. It suggests that their inability to believe stems not from sealed hearts, but from <strong>God's consequence for their persistent disbelief</strong>, resulting in a very limited amount of true faith. This verse provides a reason for their rejection of the messengers mentioned in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ ۚ بَلْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلًا مَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse describes a situation where a <strong>new Scripture (implied to be the Quran) came to the Children of Israel</strong>, which <strong>confirmed the scriptures they already possessed (the Torah)</strong>. The verse also mentions that <strong>prior to this, they used to pray for victory over the disbelievers</strong>. However, when the new Scripture and the Prophet came, <strong>whom they recognized (from their own scriptures)</strong>, they <strong>disbelieved in him and it</strong>. As a result, <strong>\"the curse of God is upon the disbelievers\"</strong>. This highlights the irony of their initial anticipation for a messenger who would bring victory, but their subsequent rejection when that messenger arrived with confirmation of their own teachings.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُوا مِنْ قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ مَا عَرَفُوا كَفَرُوا بِهِ ۚ فَلَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the <strong>negative consequences of the disbelief described in the previous verse</strong>. It states that <strong>\"vile is that for which they have sold their souls\"</strong>, which is their <strong>disbelief in God's revelations (the Quran)</strong>. The underlying motivation for this disbelief is identified as <strong>\"envy that God should send down His grace upon whomsoever He wills of His servants\"</strong>. This refers to their resentment that the prophethood and the new scripture were not given to them but to someone else (Prophet Muhammad). Consequently, <strong>\"they have incurred wrath upon wrath\"</strong>, and <strong>\"for the disbelievers is a disgraceful suffering\"</strong>. This verse emphasizes the severity of their rejection and its root cause in envy, leading to compounded divine displeasure and a humiliating punishment.","arabic":"بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَنْ يَكْفُرُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بَغْيًا أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ فَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ ۚ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ"},{"verse":"91","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"","commentary":"This verse addresses those who say they only believe in their own scriptures but reject subsequent revelations, even when these new revelations confirm what they already possess. <strong>It highlights the inconsistency of their position</strong> by pointing out that if they truly believed in God's messengers and their teachings, they would not have historically persecuted and killed prophets. The verse uses a <strong>rhetorical question to challenge the authenticity of their claim to true belief</strong> based on their past actions. This verse continues the critique of the attitude of some of the People of the Book towards new divine guidance, following the previous verse's mention of their disbelief despite recognizing the truth. The subsequent verse will likely further address their history and actions.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُوا نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَاءَهُ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَاءَ اللَّهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse refers to a specific historical event in the tradition of the Children of Israel: the story of the <strong>golden calf</strong>. It reminds them that even when Moses brought them <strong>clear evidence and divine signs</strong>, they still deviated and worshipped the calf in his absence, thus becoming <strong>wrongdoers</strong>. This serves as another historical example of their past inconsistencies and deviations from true faith, reinforcing the point made in the previous verse about their actions contradicting their claims of belief. This verse sets the context for the next verse, which will mention another significant event involving a covenant.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مُوسَىٰ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"","commentary":"This verse describes another key event in the history of the Children of Israel: the <strong>establishment of a covenant with them</strong>. It mentions that God <strong>raised a mountain over them</strong> as a powerful reminder when He commanded them to <strong>firmly adhere to the divine teachings</strong> given to them and to <strong>remember its contents</strong> so that they would remain conscious of God. This event underscores the seriousness of the commitment they made. Following the mention of their transgression with the golden calf in the previous verse, this verse emphasizes the divine efforts to guide them and the solemnity of their agreement. The next verse will likely detail how they responded to this covenant.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاسْمَعُوا ۖ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ ۚ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"Say, [O Muhammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific claim made by some, implying that <strong>paradise (the home of the Hereafter with God) is exclusively for them</strong>, excluding others. The verse presents a <strong>challenge to this claim</strong>: if it were true and they were certain of their exclusive access to paradise, they should <strong>eagerly desire death</strong>, as it would lead them to this ultimate reward. The verse uses the desire for death as a test of the sincerity and truthfulness of their assertion. This verse follows the historical accounts of the Children of Israel's past actions and covenants, moving to address a contemporary claim of exclusivity. The next verse will likely continue to refute this claim or its basis.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ كَانَتْ لَكُمُ الدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse responds to the challenge posed in the previous verse. It states that <strong>those who claim exclusive access to paradise will never actually long for death</strong>. The reason given is <strong>\"because of what their hands have forwarded,\"</strong> meaning the evil deeds and sins they have committed in their lives. Their awareness of their wrongdoing makes them fear the consequences in the Hereafter, thus preventing them from desiring death. The verse concludes by affirming that <strong>God is fully aware of the wrongdoers</strong>. This verse directly counters the hypothetical scenario presented in the previous verse, providing a reason for their lack of desire for death. The next verse will likely present another aspect of their desires in this life.","arabic":"وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.","commentary":"This verse describes another characteristic of those being addressed: their <strong>extreme attachment to worldly life</strong>. It states that they are found to be <strong>more covetous of life than even those who associate partners with God</strong>. The verse further illustrates this by mentioning that each of them wishes for a lifespan of a thousand years, highlighting an extraordinary desire to prolong their earthly existence. However, it clarifies that such a long life <strong>would not save them from the impending punishment</strong>. The verse ends with the statement that <strong>God sees everything they do</strong>. This verse shifts from their reluctance towards death (in the previous verse) to their inordinate love for this worldly life, emphasizing their misplaced priorities. The following verse will likely address their attitude towards the Prophet and the divine message.","arabic":"وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ النَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا ۚ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَنْ يُعَمَّرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur'an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"","commentary":"This verse commands the Prophet to address those who might hold animosity towards the angel Gabriel. It clarifies <strong>Gabriel's role as the one who brings down the divine revelation (the Quran) to the Prophet's heart</strong>. This is done <strong>by God's permission</strong>, and the revelation serves to <strong>confirm previous scriptures</strong> and act as <strong>guidance and good news for those who believe</strong>. This verse addresses a potential objection or point of contention regarding the source of the revelation. It emphasizes the divine origin and the beneficial nature of the message. The next verse will likely elaborate on the consequences of being an enemy to Gabriel.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse builds upon the previous one by stating that <strong>whoever shows enmity towards God, His angels (specifically mentioning Gabriel and Michael), and His messengers, then God is an enemy to such disbelievers</strong>. It broadens the scope beyond just Gabriel, linking opposition to him with opposition to God and all His divine instruments. This verse underscores the interconnectedness of the divine realm and the serious implications of rejecting any part of it. Following the clarification of Gabriel's role, this verse clarifies the stance God takes towards those who oppose Him and His messengers. The subsequent verse will introduce a new point related to the clarity of the divine message.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِلَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَالَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the <strong>clarity of the divine messages</strong> that have been revealed. It states that these messages are <strong>clear and unambiguous</strong>, leaving little room for doubt. Consequently, <strong>only those who deliberately defy God</strong> would refuse to believe in them. This verse highlights the accessibility and straightforward nature of the divine guidance, suggesting that disbelief stems from intentional rejection rather than a lack of clarity. Following the discussion about enmity towards divine figures, this verse focuses on the nature of the messages themselves. The next verse will likely address another aspect of the behavior of those who disbelieve despite the clear messages.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ ۖ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَا إِلَّا الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.","commentary":"This verse points to a recurring pattern of behavior: <strong>whenever a covenant (agreement) was made with them, a significant portion of them would disregard it and break their commitment</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>most of them do not believe</strong>, suggesting that this tendency to break covenants is indicative of a deeper lack of faith. This verse returns to the theme of the Children of Israel's unreliability and their failure to uphold their agreements with God, following the verses about their attitude towards revelation and divine messengers. This reinforces the overall narrative of their history as a people who were repeatedly given guidance but often failed to adhere to it.","arabic":"أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُوا عَهْدًا نَبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].","commentary":"This verse describes a situation where a <strong>new messenger</strong> (understood by Muslims to be Muhammad) came to those who already possessed <strong>divine scriptures</strong> (like the Torah and the Gospel). This new messenger brought a message (<strong>the Quran</strong>) that <strong>confirmed the truths found in their own scriptures</strong>. However, a group of these people <strong>rejected this new message</strong>, acting as if they were ignorant of its truth, despite its alignment with their existing beliefs. This verse follows the discussion about broken covenants and disbelief in the previous verse, highlighting another reason for their rejection: ignoring a confirming message. The next verse will likely delve into what these rejecting individuals chose to follow instead.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\" And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.","commentary":"This verse addresses what some chose to follow instead of the confirming message. It mentions that they followed <strong>teachings attributed to devils during the time of Solomon</strong>, specifically <strong>magic</strong>. The verse clarifies that <strong>Solomon himself did not disbelieve</strong>, but it was the <strong>devils who disbelieved</strong> by teaching magic. It also mentions <strong>two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut</strong>, who were involved in teaching something that was also a <strong>test</strong>, warning people not to misuse it for disbelief. Despite this warning, people learned from them things that could cause <strong>harm, such as separation between spouses</strong>, clarifying that such harm could only occur <strong>by God's permission</strong>. The verse points out that they learned what was <strong>harmful and not beneficial</strong>, and they were aware that those who engaged in such practices would have <strong>no share in the Hereafter</strong>. The verse concludes by criticizing how poorly they judged by choosing magic over divine guidance. This verse contrasts the divine message with what they preferred to follow. The next verse will discuss a better alternative: belief and mindfulness of God.","arabic":"وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ ۖ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ ۖ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ ۚ وَمَا هُمْ بِضَارِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنْفَعُهُمْ ۚ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been [far] better, if they only knew.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>contrast</strong> to the actions described in the previous verses. It states that <strong>if those who rejected the confirming messenger and followed magic had instead believed</strong> in God and His message and had been <strong>mindful of God</strong> (meaning to be conscious of their duties and avoid wrongdoing), then the <strong>reward they would have received from God would have been far better</strong>. The verse ends with \"if they only knew,\" highlighting their lack of understanding of true value. This verse provides a clear alternative to the path of disbelief and harmful practices. The following verse shifts to a different aspect of the interaction between believers and those who disbelieve.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ ۖ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"O you who have believed, say not [to Allah 's Messenger], \"Ra'ina\" but say, \"Unthurna\" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>guidance to the believers</strong> on how to address the Prophet. It advises them to <strong>avoid using the word \"Ra'ina\"</strong> because it was an ambiguous term that could be interpreted negatively or disrespectfully in Arabic. Instead, they are instructed to use the word <strong>\"Unzhurna,\"</strong> which clearly means \"Look at us\" or \"Give us your attention.\" The verse also emphasizes the importance of <strong>listening attentively</strong> to the Prophet. It concludes by mentioning that <strong>for the disbelievers is a painful punishment</strong>, returning to the theme of consequences for rejecting faith. This verse serves as an instruction for believers in their interactions with the Prophet. The next verse will likely describe the reactions and desires of the disbelievers towards the believers.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقُولُوا رَاعِنَا وَقُولُوا انْظُرْنَا وَاسْمَعُوا ۗ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"105","text":"Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>attitude of some of the People of the Scripture (like Jews and Christians who disbelieved)</strong> and <strong>polytheists</strong> towards the believers. It states that they <strong>do not wish for any good</strong> (any revelation or blessing) to be bestowed upon the believers from their Lord (God). The verse then affirms God's sovereignty, stating that <strong>God chooses for His mercy whom He wills</strong>, and that <strong>God is the possessor of great bounty</strong>. This highlights that divine favor is ultimately in God's hands and not dependent on the wishes of those who disbelieve. This verse explains the nature of the opposition faced by the early Muslim community. The next verse introduces the concept of changes or abrogation in divine messages.","arabic":"مَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَلَا الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَنْ يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ"},{"verse":"106","text":"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?","commentary":"This verse introduces the concept of <strong>abrogation (naskh)</strong> in the Quran. It explains that God may <strong>abrogate (cancel or replace)</strong> a verse or cause it to be <strong>forgotten</strong>, but this is always followed by bringing forth a verse that is <strong>better than it or similar to it</strong>. The verse concludes with a rhetorical question emphasizing <strong>God's power over all things</strong>, which includes the ability to alter or replace His messages as He wills. This verse addresses a potentially complex theological point about the evolution of divine guidance. The following verse reinforces God's absolute authority and knowledge.","arabic":"مَا نَنْسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنْسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا ۗ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"107","text":"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?","commentary":"This verse <strong>reinforces God's absolute authority and ownership</strong> over everything. It poses a rhetorical question reminding people that <strong>to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth</strong>. It also emphasizes that <strong>besides God, believers have no ultimate protector or helper</strong>. This affirmation of God's power and sovereignty provides context for the previous verse's discussion of abrogation, highlighting that all such changes are within God's power. The next verse questions the believers' desire to challenge their messenger.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.","commentary":"This verse addresses the believers, questioning whether they <strong>intend to ask their Messenger (Muhammad) questions in a manner similar to how Moses was questioned before</strong>. This implies that some of the questions asked of Moses were out of doubt or challenge. The verse then issues a warning: <strong>whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the right way</strong>. This serves as a caution against unnecessary questioning that could lead to doubt and deviation from true belief. This verse shifts focus to the attitude of believers towards their own messenger, drawing a parallel with the past. The subsequent verse will describe the envious desires of some among the People of the Book.","arabic":"أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَسْأَلُوا رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۗ وَمَنْ يَتَبَدَّلِ الْكُفْرَ بِالْإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse highlights the <strong>desire of many among the People of the Scripture</strong> (those who disbelieved) <strong>to turn the believers back to disbelief</strong> after they had embraced Islam. The motivation behind this wish is identified as <strong>envy from themselves</strong>, even though the truth of the new message had become clear to them. Despite this opposition, the believers are instructed to <strong>pardon and overlook</strong> their behavior <strong>until God delivers His command</strong> (which could refer to divine judgment or further instructions). The verse concludes by affirming that <strong>God is competent over all things</strong>, assuring believers that God will ultimately handle the situation. This verse describes the nature of the opposition and provides guidance on how to respond in the short term. The next verse offers positive guidance for the believers themselves.","arabic":"وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ ۖ فَاعْفُوا وَاصْفَحُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"110","text":"And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>positive instructions for the believers</strong>. It commands them to <strong>establish regular prayer</strong> and to <strong>give zakah (obligatory charity)</strong>. It also offers an encouraging note, stating that <strong>whatever good they put forward for themselves (in this life)</strong> in terms of righteous deeds, <strong>they will find it with God</strong> in the Hereafter as a reward. The verse concludes by emphasizing God's awareness, stating that <strong>God is Seeing of what they do</strong>. This verse shifts from addressing the opposition to focusing on the essential practices and ultimate rewards for the believers. The following verses will likely continue with either guidance for believers or further descriptions of the disbelievers' attitudes.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"111","text":"And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking, Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses the <strong>claim made by some Jews and Christians that Paradise is exclusive to them</strong>. It characterizes this claim as mere <strong>wishful thinking</strong>. The verse then instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to <strong>challenge them to provide evidence</strong> for this assertion, implying that such exclusive claims require proof. This verse follows the discussion of reward and the consequences of actions in the previous verse, suggesting that salvation is not based on religious affiliation alone, but on something more substantive. It sets the stage for the subsequent verses that will outline a broader perspective on faith and righteousness.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"112","text":"Yes [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse provides a <strong>contrasting view to the exclusive claims of the previous verse</strong>. It states that <strong>true merit lies in complete submission to God and in performing good deeds</strong>. Those who embody these qualities will receive their reward from God and will be free from fear and grief. This verse connects to the previous one by offering a universal principle for attaining divine reward, regardless of specific religious labels. It precedes verses that will further explore the differences in beliefs among religious groups.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"The Jews say \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture.

It also mentions that those <strong>without knowledge make similar kinds of unsubstantiated claims</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>God will be the ultimate judge</strong> of their differences on the Day of Resurrection. This verse follows the universal principle of submission and good deeds by illustrating the existing divisions among religious communities. It leads into a discussion about the sanctity of places of worship, which can be undermined by such exclusionary attitudes.","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ ۚ فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques and strive toward their destruction.

It condemns such actions as the <strong>utmost injustice</strong>. The verse suggests that those who enter these sacred places should do so with reverence, and that those who act unjustly towards them will face disgrace in this life and severe punishment in the Hereafter.
