    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Alif, Lam, Meem.","commentary":"This verse consists of <strong>three Arabic letters</strong>. Several chapters (Surahs) in the Qur'an begin with such combinations of Arabic letters. The exact meaning of these letters is not definitively known, and interpretations vary. One perspective suggests that these letter combinations emphasize that the Qur'an, despite being composed of the same Arabic letters used by the people it first addressed, is an <strong>unparalleled and unique work</strong> that no one can replicate. It's as if to say, \"This remarkable book is made up of the very letters you use\". This verse serves as an <strong>introductory and distinctive mark</strong> of this chapter. The verse that follows immediately after this one is presented as the direct message of the book introduced here.","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -","commentary":"This verse introduces the Qur'an as \"<strong>the Book</strong>\" and states that there is <strong>no doubt</strong> about its authenticity. It is further described as \"<strong>a guidance for the God-fearing</strong>\". The term \"God-fearing\" here can be understood as referring to those who are <strong>mindful of God</strong>, aware of their responsibilities, and seeking to live righteously. The key word here is \"<strong>guidance</strong>,\" indicating the Qur'an's purpose. This verse immediately follows the enigmatic letters of the first verse, suggesting that <strong>the message of guidance</strong> will now be elaborated upon. The next verses will describe the characteristics of these \"God-fearing\" people who can benefit from this guidance.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,","commentary":"This verse begins to describe the \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>\" mentioned in the previous verse. The first characteristic is that they \"<strong>believe in what lies beyond the reach of human perception</strong>\". This can be understood as having faith in aspects of reality that are not directly observable through our senses. The verse continues by stating that they \"<strong>observe Prayer</strong>\" and \"<strong>give of what We bestow upon them</strong>\". \"Prayer\" here signifies a form of <strong>regular devotion and connection with the Divine</strong>. \"<strong>Giving of what We bestow upon them</strong>\" implies <strong>charity and sharing</strong> the resources they have been given. This verse builds upon the previous one by outlining the <strong>fundamental qualities of those who seek and benefit from the Qur'an's guidance</strong>. The following verses will continue to elaborate on these characteristics.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].","commentary":"Continuing the description of the \"God-fearing,\" this verse adds further characteristics. They are described as those \"<strong>who believe in what has been revealed to you</strong>\" (referring to the Prophet Muhammad and the Qur'an) \"<strong>and what was revealed before you</strong>\" (referring to previous divine messages and scriptures). This highlights a <strong>recognition of the continuity of divine guidance</strong>. Additionally, they \"<strong>are certain of the Hereafter</strong>,\" indicating a firm belief in an afterlife and accountability for one's actions. This verse connects to the previous one by adding <strong>belief in past and present divine revelations and the concept of an afterlife</strong> to the attributes of the guided. The next verse summarizes the outcome for those with these qualities.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.","commentary":"This verse concludes the description of the \"God-fearing\" individuals introduced in Verse 2 and elaborated upon in Verses 3 and 4. It states that \"<strong>Those follow their Lord’s guidance</strong>,\" directly linking their beliefs and actions to the guidance mentioned earlier. The verse ends with the assurance that \"<strong>they shall surely prosper</strong>,\" indicating a positive outcome for those who adhere to this guidance. This verse serves as a <strong>summary and a promise</strong> for those who embody the characteristics described in the preceding verses. The passage now transitions to describing a contrasting group of people.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>shift in focus</strong>, moving from the description of believers to that of \"<strong>those who disbelieve</strong>\". It highlights a state of <strong>unwillingness to believe</strong>, suggesting that warnings or their absence will not alter their stance. This verse presents a <strong>contrast to the receptive nature of the \"God-fearing\"</strong> described in the previous verses. The subsequent verse will explain the reason behind this resistance to belief.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنْذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.","commentary":"This verse explains the <strong>reason for the disbelief</strong> mentioned in the previous verse. It states that \"<strong>God has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil</strong>\". This is a <strong>metaphorical description</strong> of a state where individuals have become <strong>closed off to understanding and accepting truth</strong>. It suggests a hardening of their inner faculties, preventing them from receiving guidance. The verse concludes by stating that \"<strong>for them is a great punishment</strong>,\" indicating the consequences of their chosen path. This verse follows from the previous one by providing a reason for the disbelievers' lack of faith and sets the stage for the description of another group.","arabic":"خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ ۖ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَارِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day,\" but they are not believers.","commentary":"This verse introduces a <strong>third group of people</strong>: those \"<strong>who say, ‘We believe in God and the Last Day,’ while they do not believe</strong>\". This describes individuals who <strong>outwardly profess belief but inwardly lack genuine faith</strong>. They are presented as distinct from both the true believers described in Verses 3-5 and the outright disbelievers of Verses 6-7. This verse breaks from the direct contrast between believers and disbelievers to introduce the <strong>concept of hypocrisy</strong>. The following verses will further elaborate on the characteristics and motivations of this group.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse delves into the <strong>actions and mindset of the hypocrites</strong> introduced in the previous verse. It states that \"<strong>They [think to] deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not</strong>\". This highlights the <strong>self-deceptive nature of hypocrisy</strong>. While they intend to mislead others, in reality, they are only harming themselves by their lack of true faith. This verse builds upon the introduction of the hypocrites by explaining the <strong>futile nature of their attempts to deceive</strong>. The subsequent verse will further describe the state of their hearts.","arabic":"يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.","commentary":"Continuing the description of the hypocrites, this verse focuses on their <strong>inner state</strong>. It states, \"<strong>In their hearts is disease, so God has increased their disease</strong>\". The \"<strong>disease</strong>\" here is <strong>a metaphor for doubt, insincerity, and spiritual sickness</strong>. The verse suggests that their initial lack of genuine faith leads to a further worsening of their condition. It concludes by stating, \"<strong>and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] lie</strong>,\" linking their fate to their <strong>deceptive nature</strong>. This verse follows the explanation of their attempted deception by describing the <strong>internal affliction</strong> that underlies their hypocrisy and the consequence of their actions. This marks the end of the initial classification of humanity into believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites in this chapter.","arabic":"فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Do not cause corruption on the earth,\" they say, \"We are but reformers.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the <strong>hypocrites</strong> introduced in the previous verses. When they are advised \"<strong>Do not cause corruption on the earth</strong>,\" they ironically respond by claiming, \"<strong>We are but reformers</strong>.\" This highlights their <strong>self-deception and their inability to recognize the negative impact of their actions</strong>. They perceive their mischief as beneficial, further illustrating their lack of true understanding. This verse follows the description of their deceitful intentions and inner spiritual sickness, showing how their outward justifications contradict their harmful behavior. The next verse will expose the reality of their actions.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse directly <strong>refutes the hypocrites' claim of being reformers</strong> in the previous verse. It states emphatically, \"<strong>Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not</strong>.\" This underscores the <strong>disconnect between their self-perception and the reality of their actions</strong>. Their activities, driven by their lack of genuine faith and their desire to deceive, are identified as causing corruption, even though they fail to see it. This verse serves as a <strong>direct counterpoint</strong> to the hypocrites' assertion in the preceding verse. The verse that follows will describe another aspect of their flawed behavior.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe as the people have believed,\" they say, \"Should we believe as the foolish have believed?\" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.","commentary":"Continuing the portrayal of the hypocrites, this verse describes their reaction when urged to \"<strong>Believe as the people have believed</strong>,\" likely referring to the sincere believers. They respond with arrogance, questioning, \"<strong>Shall we believe as the foolish have believed?</strong>\" This reveals their <strong>contempt for genuine faith and their misguided sense of superiority</strong>. The verse immediately refutes their claim, stating, \"<strong>Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they do not know</strong>.\" This highlights their <strong>ignorance of true wisdom and their inability to recognize their own folly</strong>. This verse follows the exposure of their corrupting influence, now focusing on their arrogant dismissal of true believers. The next verses will contrast their behavior in private and public settings.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We believe\"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, \"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.\"","commentary":"This verse illustrates the <strong>duplicitous nature of the hypocrites</strong>. \"<strong>When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'</strong>,\" showing their outward conformity. \"<strong>But when they are alone with their evil ones</strong>,\" meaning their allies in hypocrisy and disbelief, \"<strong>they say, 'Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers'</strong>.\" This reveals their <strong>double-faced behavior</strong>, presenting one image to the believers and a completely different one in private. This verse follows their arrogant dismissal of believers, now showing the extent of their deception and their alliance with those who oppose faith. The subsequent verse will describe how God responds to their mockery.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.","commentary":"This verse describes <strong>God's response to the hypocrites' mockery</strong> described in the previous verse. \"<strong>God mocks them</strong>\" here is not meant in a literal sense but signifies <strong>God's just recompense and the futility of their schemes</strong>. It continues by stating that God \"<strong>prolongs them in their transgression [so] they wander blindly</strong>.\" This suggests that they are left to continue in their misguided path, further deepening their straying from truth. This verse directly follows the revelation of the hypocrites' mocking behavior, showing the divine consequence of their actions. The next verses will highlight the contrast between the hypocrites' choice and the path of true guidance.","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.","commentary":"This verse characterizes the <strong>hypocrites as having \"</strong>purchased error [in exchange] for guidance<strong>.\" This is a metaphor illustrating their </strong>willful choice of falsehood over truth<strong>, despite having the opportunity for guidance. The verse then states that \"</strong>their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided<strong>,\" emphasizing the </strong>ultimate loss and failure** of their path. This verse follows the description of God's response to their mockery, highlighting the detrimental consequences of their deliberate choice. The following verses will use a parable to further illustrate their condition.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.","commentary":"This verse begins a <strong>parable</strong> to illustrate the situation of the hypocrites. It describes someone who \"<strong>kindled a fire, and when it illuminated what was around him, God took away his light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see</strong>.\" The initial kindling of the fire can be seen as a temporary glimpse of truth or benefit that the hypocrites might experience, but this is ultimately extinguished, leaving them in darkness and confusion. This verse follows the description of their misguided choice, using a vivid image to convey their state. The next verse continues this parable with further descriptions of their condition.","arabic":"مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].","commentary":"This verse continues the <strong>parable of the fire</strong>, describing the hypocrites as \"<strong>Deaf, dumb, and blind</strong>.\" These are <strong>metaphorical descriptions</strong> signifying their <strong>inability to hear and understand the truth, their unwillingness to speak the truth, and their blindness to the clear signs around them</strong>. The verse concludes with \"<strong>so they will not return [to the right path]</strong>,\" emphasizing their <strong>entrenched state of misguidance</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one, adding further sensory deprivations to illustrate their spiritual condition. The following verse introduces another aspect of their parable.","arabic":"صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse presents <strong>another parable</strong>, offering a different perspective on the condition of the hypocrites. It compares them to being caught in \"<strong>a rainstorm from the sky, within which are darknesses, thunder, and lightning</strong>.\" This can be interpreted as the <strong>turmoil and fear they experience due to the truth and its consequences</strong>. \"<strong>They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearing death</strong>,\" illustrating their attempt to <strong>avoid hearing the truth because they fear its implications</strong>. The verse concludes with \"<strong>But God encompasses the disbelievers</strong>,\" highlighting God's ultimate power and knowledge over them. This verse provides an alternative image to the fire parable, focusing on their fear and avoidance of the truth. The next verse will continue with this theme of their internal conflict and uncertainty.","arabic":"أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَاتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِمْ مِنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse concludes the <strong>parable of the rainstorm</strong>, further illustrating the <strong>hypocrites' unstable and precarious state</strong>. \"<strong>The lightning almost snatches away their sight</strong>,\" symbolizing the <strong>fleeting moments of clarity or truth that they encounter, which are almost overwhelming</strong>. \"<strong>Every time it flashes for them, they walk within it; but when darkness comes upon them, they stand [still]</strong>,\" depicting their <strong>temporary movement towards truth followed by stagnation and confusion when the light fades</strong>. The verse ends with \"<strong>And if God had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, God is over all things competent</strong>,\" emphasizing <strong>God's power over their faculties and their ultimate dependence on Him</strong>. This verse concludes the extended metaphor illustrating the inconsistent and ultimately lost state of the hypocrites, contrasting with the clear guidance offered to the believers at the beginning of the chapter.","arabic":"يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُمْ مَشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"21","text":"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -","commentary":"This verse begins by directly addressing all of <strong>humankind</strong>, calling on them to <strong>worship their Lord</strong>, the one who <strong>created them and previous generations</strong>. The purpose of this worship is stated as to <strong>become righteous</strong>, suggesting that through acknowledging and submitting to the Creator, individuals can attain a state of moral and spiritual well-being. This verse follows the introduction of different categories of people (believers, hypocrites, and unbelievers) and serves as a universal call to embrace faith in the one God. It connects to the next verse by elaborating on the blessings and provisions bestowed by this Lord, justifying the call to worship.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the reasons why humanity should worship their Lord, by highlighting some of the <strong>benefits and provisions</strong> He has provided. It mentions that God has made the <strong>earth a resting place</strong> and the <strong>sky a canopy</strong>, and that He sends down <strong>rain to bring forth fruits as sustenance</strong> for people. Based on these acts of creation and provision, the verse concludes with a strong encouragement <strong>not to associate any equals with God knowingly</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one by giving concrete examples of God's favor towards humanity, reinforcing the call to worship Him alone. It leads into the subsequent verses which address those who might doubt the message brought by God's messenger.","arabic":"الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who might have <strong>doubts about the divine origin of the message</strong> revealed to God's <strong>servant</strong> (referring to the Prophet Muhammad). It presents a <strong>challenge</strong>: if they doubt its authenticity, they are asked to <strong>produce even one sūrah (chapter) comparable to it</strong>. To accomplish this, they are invited to <strong>call upon anyone for help, except God</strong>, if their claim of its human origin is true. This serves as a test of the uniqueness and unparalleled nature of the divine revelation. It follows the description of God's creation and provision by suggesting that the revealed message is another manifestation of His power and wisdom, which humans cannot replicate. It connects to the next verse by describing the consequences for those who fail this challenge and continue to reject the truth.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse follows the challenge to produce a comparable sūrah and states with certainty that <strong>humanity will never be able to meet this challenge</strong>. It then warns those who reject the divine message to <strong>fear the Fire</strong>, which is described as having <strong>people and stones as its fuel</strong> and being <strong>prepared for the disbelievers</strong>. This serves as a strong warning against disbelief and emphasizes the serious consequences of rejecting what is presented as divine truth. It builds upon the previous verse by highlighting the inability of humans to produce anything like the revealed message, thus underscoring its divine origin and the validity of the warning. It leads into the next verse, which offers a contrasting picture of the reward awaiting those who believe.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا وَلَنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse offers <strong>good news and promises of reward for those who believe and do righteous deeds</strong>. It describes <strong>gardens in Paradise with flowing rivers</strong>, where believers will be provided with <strong>fruit</strong>. When given the fruit, they will recognize its resemblance to what they had before, and they will also receive fruit of a similar kind. Additionally, Paradise is described as having <strong>purified spouses</strong> and being a place where believers will <strong>abide eternally</strong>. This verse provides a clear contrast to the warning in the previous verse, outlining the positive outcome for those who accept the divine message and live righteously. It connects to the preceding verse by presenting the reward for believers as opposed to the punishment for disbelievers. It leads into the following verses, which discuss the use of parables in the divine message.","arabic":"وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِزْقًا ۙ قَالُوا هَٰذَا الَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَأُتُوا بِهِ مُتَشَابِهًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ ۖ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, \"What did Allah intend by this as an example?\" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,","commentary":"This verse addresses the use of <strong>examples or parables</strong> in the divine message, stating that <strong>God is not hesitant to use any example</strong>, whether it is that of a <strong>mosquito or something even smaller</strong>. It explains that <strong>believers recognize these examples as the truth from their Lord</strong>, while <strong>disbelievers question their purpose</strong>. The verse clarifies that God <strong>guides many through these examples and misguides many</strong>, but He <strong>only misguides those who are defiantly disobedient</strong>. This verse follows the description of rewards for believers and punishment for disbelievers by addressing a potential point of confusion or objection regarding the nature of the divine message itself. It connects to the next verse by describing the characteristics of those who are misguided.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.","commentary":"This verse describes the characteristics of those who are referred to as \"defiantly disobedient\" in the previous verse and identified as being misguided by the divine examples. It lists three key actions: <strong>breaking God's covenant after it has been confirmed</strong>, <strong>severing what God has commanded to be joined</strong> (such as bonds of kinship or faith), and <strong>causing corruption on earth</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>it is these individuals who are the losers</strong>. This verse elaborates on the nature of disobedience and transgression, providing specific examples of behaviors that lead to misguidance and loss. It connects to the preceding verse by describing the attributes of those who are misguided by God's examples. It leads into the next verse, which questions how such individuals can deny God after having been given life.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَنْقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.","commentary":"This verse poses a rhetorical question to those who disbelieve: <strong>how can they deny God</strong> when they were <strong>lifeless and He brought them into existence</strong>. It further reminds them that <strong>He will cause them to die, and then He will bring them back to life</strong>, after which they will <strong>be returned to Him</strong> for judgment. This verse emphasizes the power of God over life and death and the inevitability of resurrection and accountability. It follows the description of disobedient individuals by questioning their denial of the very God who created them and will ultimately bring them to account. It connects to the next verse by highlighting the extent of God's creation and provision for humanity.","arabic":"كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ ۖ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.","commentary":"This verse further emphasizes God's power and authority by stating that <strong>He is the one who created for humanity everything that is on the earth</strong>. It also mentions that He <strong>directed Himself to the heaven and fashioned it into seven heavens</strong>. The verse concludes by affirming that <strong>He is Knowing of all things</strong>, highlighting His complete knowledge of His creation. This verse follows the reminder of God's power over life and death by detailing the vastness and comprehensiveness of His creation, all for the benefit of humanity. It sets the stage for the next verse, which introduces the creation of Adam and the concept of humanity's role as vicegerent on Earth.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ ۚ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"30","text":"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\" They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?\" Allah said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a new section by recounting when <strong>God informed the angels of His intention to create a \"successive authority\" (often understood as a vicegerent or steward) on the earth</strong>. The <strong>angels questioned this decision</strong>, expressing concern that this new creation would <strong>cause corruption and shed blood</strong>, while they themselves constantly <strong>declare God's purity and holiness</strong>. God responded by stating that <strong>He knows things that the angels do not know</strong>. This verse introduces the concept of humanity's special role and potential on Earth, as well as the initial apprehension and subsequent divine wisdom behind this creation. It follows the description of God's vast creation by focusing on the creation of humankind and its designated role. It leads into the subsequent verses, which describe the creation of Adam and the imparting of knowledge to him. This verse (which is the one before your requested range but crucial for context) sets the stage by describing a dialogue between God and the angels. God informs the angels of His intention to appoint a <strong>\"vicegerent on earth\"</strong>, suggesting a being who would have authority and responsibility on the planet. The angels express a concern, questioning if this being would cause disruption and violence. God responds by stating His <strong>knowledge surpasses theirs</strong> regarding this matter. This introduces the concept of humanity's role on Earth and hints at a divine purpose that may not be immediately apparent.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"","commentary":"Following the declaration of appointing a vicegerent, this verse describes God teaching <strong>Adam \"all the names [of things]\"</strong>. This act of bestowing knowledge upon Adam is significant. Then, God presents these very things to the angels and asks them to name them, challenging their understanding. This highlights <strong>Adam's unique capacity for knowledge</strong> and understanding, a quality that perhaps justified his role as vicegerent mentioned in the previous verse. It suggests that knowledge is a key aspect of humanity's intended role.","arabic":"وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.\"","commentary":"This verse shows the <strong>angels' humble acknowledgment</strong> of their limitations. They profess that their knowledge is only what God has granted them and affirm God's ultimate wisdom and knowledge (\"<strong>All-Knowing, the All-Wise</strong>\"). This response contrasts with their initial questioning in verse 30, demonstrating their acceptance of God's superior wisdom and the wisdom behind Adam's unique abilities showcased in the previous verse.","arabic":"قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"33","text":"He said, \"O Adam, inform them of their names.\" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\"","commentary":"Here, God instructs <strong>Adam to tell the angels the names</strong> of the things. Upon Adam doing so, God addresses the angels again, reminding them that He knows the \"<strong>secrets of the heavens and the earth</strong>\" and is aware of both what is <strong>\"reveal[ed] and what [is] conceal[ed]\"</strong>. This verse reinforces God's comprehensive knowledge and wisdom, as highlighted in the previous verse, and further emphasizes Adam's granted knowledge, which the angels lacked. It also implicitly validates God's choice of Adam as vicegerent.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.","commentary":"Following the demonstration of Adam's knowledge, God commands the <strong>angels to \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam\"</strong>. This act of prostration signifies respect and recognition of Adam's status. The verse states that <strong>all the angels obeyed</strong>, except for \"<strong>Iblīs</strong>\" (often understood as Satan), who \"<strong>refused and was arrogant</strong>\" and thus became \"<strong>one of the disbelievers</strong>\". This introduces the theme of disobedience and arrogance as opposed to divine command and humility, setting up a contrast for future actions and choices.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"","commentary":"After the episode of prostration, God instructs <strong>Adam and his wife to \"dwell...in Paradise\"</strong> and grants them permission to <strong>\"eat freely therefrom wherever you wish\"</strong>. However, God imposes a <strong>specific restriction</strong>: \"<strong>do not go near this tree, lest you become wrongdoers</strong>\". This introduces the concept of divine guidance and the potential for transgression. It establishes a test of obedience for Adam and his wife within their blessed environment.","arabic":"وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"","commentary":"This verse describes how <strong>\"Satan caused them to slip out of it [Paradise]\"</strong>, leading to their <strong>expulsion from their previous state</strong> of ease and freedom. God then declares \"<strong>Descend</strong>\" to Earth, stating that there will be \"<strong>enmity</strong>\" among them and that Earth will be a \"<strong>dwelling place and enjoyment for a time</strong>\". This marks a significant shift from the idyllic Paradise to the challenges of earthly existence. The consequence of disobedience is made clear, and the new reality for humanity is established.","arabic":"فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ ۖ وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.","commentary":"Despite the transgression and the descent to Earth, this verse offers a message of hope. It states that <strong>\"Adam received words [of guidance] from his Lord\"</strong>, and as a result, God \"<strong>accepted his repentance</strong>\". God is described as \"<strong>the Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful</strong>\". This highlights the possibility of seeking and receiving forgiveness from God even after mistakes. It introduces the theme of repentance as a path back to divine favor.","arabic":"فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"38","text":"We said, \"Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"Following the acceptance of Adam's repentance, God addresses humanity (implied by \"<strong>all of you</strong>\"), stating \"<strong>Go down from it [presumably a higher state or the Garden], all of you.</strong>\". However, this is accompanied by a crucial promise: \"<strong>if guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor suffer</strong>\". This verse establishes a fundamental principle: divine guidance will be provided to humanity on Earth, and following this guidance is the key to avoiding misdirection and hardship. It connects the earlier story of Adam to the broader human experience.","arabic":"قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ مِنِّي هُدًى فَمَنْ تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\"","commentary":"This verse presents a clear <strong>contrast</strong> to the promise in the previous verse. It describes the fate of those who \"<strong>disbelieve and deny Our signs</strong>\" (the divine guidance mentioned earlier). They are described as \"<strong>the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein forever</strong>\". This emphasizes the serious consequences of rejecting divine guidance and highlights the importance of belief and acceptance. It serves as a warning following the promise of guidance.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>transition</strong>, specifically addressing the \"<strong>Children of Israel</strong>\". It begins by reminding them of \"<strong>My favour which I have bestowed on you</strong>,\" suggesting a history of divine blessings and a special relationship. God then calls upon them to \"<strong>Fulfil your covenant with Me and I will fulfil Mine with you</strong>,\" emphasizing a mutual agreement and obligation. The verse concludes with the instruction \"<strong>and of Me alone stand in awe</strong>,\" stressing the importance of fearing and respecting God. This verse shifts the focus from the general narrative of creation and the fall of humanity to a specific community and their particular responsibilities and historical context, while still echoing the themes of divine favor and the importance of obedience seen in earlier verses.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ"},{"verse":"41","text":"And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.","commentary":"This verse continues the address to the <strong>Children of Israel</strong> that began in the previous verse. Following the reminder of God's favor and the call to fulfill their covenant, this verse urges them to <strong>believe in the new revelations</strong> that have been given, stating that these revelations <strong>confirm what they already possess</strong> (likely referring to their existing scriptures). It cautions them <strong>not to be the first to reject</strong> these new teachings. Furthermore, it advises them <strong>not to exchange God's revelations for a \"paltry price\"</strong>, suggesting they should not prioritize worldly gains or positions over spiritual truth. The verse concludes by emphasizing that <strong>fear (or reverence) should be directed towards God alone</strong>. This verse builds upon the idea of a covenant and introduces the expectation of accepting new guidance, while warning against prioritizing worldly interests over spiritual principles. The next verse will likely provide further specific instructions or criticisms related to this call to believe.","arabic":"وَآمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوا أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَإِيَّايَ فَاتَّقُونِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].","commentary":"This verse directly follows the call to believe in the new revelations and to avoid rejecting them for worldly gains. It instructs the <strong>Children of Israel</strong> <strong>not to \"overlay the truth with falsehood\"</strong>, which could mean not to distort or mix true teachings with untrue ones. It also commands them <strong>not to \"knowingly suppress the truth\"</strong>, implying that they may be aware of the truth of the new revelations but are choosing to conceal or ignore it. This verse emphasizes the importance of <strong>honesty and integrity in matters of faith and knowledge</strong>, and it sets the stage for potential criticisms of their actions in the verses that follow. It connects to the previous verse by highlighting specific ways in which they might fail to adhere to the call for belief and reverence.","arabic":"وَلَا تَلْبِسُوا الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُوا الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"43","text":"And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].","commentary":"Continuing the address to the <strong>Children of Israel</strong>, this verse provides <strong>specific instructions related to religious practice</strong>. It calls on them to \"<strong>attend regularly to your prayers</strong>,\" emphasizing the importance of consistent worship. It also mentions \"<strong>pay your zakāt</strong>,\" which in Islamic teachings refers to a form of obligatory charitable giving or financial contribution for the welfare of the community. Finally, it instructs them to \"<strong>bow down in prayers with those who bow down</strong>,\" which can be understood as a call to join the community of believers in their acts of worship, possibly alluding to the practices of the emerging Muslim community. This verse provides concrete actions expected of them in response to the call for belief and truthfulness in the preceding verses, and it leads into the subsequent verse which will question their own adherence to righteousness.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ"},{"verse":"44","text":"Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?","commentary":"This verse directly addresses the <strong>Children of Israel</strong>, questioning their <strong>hypocrisy</strong>. It points out a discrepancy between their actions and their teachings, asking \"<strong>How can you bid others to be righteous and forget yourselves, even when you read the Scriptures?</strong>\" This suggests that they may be advising others to follow certain principles while not adhering to those principles themselves, despite having access to divine scriptures. The rhetorical question \"<strong>Do you not understand?</strong>\" emphasizes the lack of wisdom in such behavior. This verse serves as a critique, stemming from the instructions on prayer and charity in the previous verse, highlighting the importance of practicing what one preaches. The next verse will likely offer further guidance on how they should conduct themselves.","arabic":"أَتَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"45","text":"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]","commentary":"Following the critique of hypocrisy in the previous verse, this verse offers guidance on how to overcome challenges and remain steadfast. It advises \"<strong>Seek strength in patient perseverance and in prayer</strong>.\" This suggests that both <strong>inner resilience (patience)</strong> and <strong>spiritual connection with God (prayer)</strong> are essential for navigating difficulties. The verse acknowledges that prayer \"<strong>is indeed a demanding task except for the devout</strong>,\" implying that those who are sincerely committed to God will find the strength to persevere in prayer. This verse offers a way to rectify the shortcomings mentioned in the previous verse, emphasizing reliance on spiritual and personal fortitude. It sets the stage for the next verse, which further describes the characteristics of the devout.","arabic":"وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ"},{"verse":"46","text":"Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.","commentary":"This verse continues the explanation of \"<strong>the devout</strong>\" mentioned at the end of the previous verse. It defines them as those \"<strong>who know that they shall meet their Lord and to Him they shall ultimately return</strong>.\" This belief in a <strong>future meeting with God and the ultimate return to Him</strong> serves as a powerful motivation for the devout to persevere patiently and engage in prayer with sincerity. It highlights the <strong>importance of accountability and the afterlife</strong> in shaping one's actions and commitment in this life. This verse provides the foundation for the devoutness mentioned earlier and connects to the overarching themes of faith and consequence. The subsequent verses will likely shift focus or provide further context based on this understanding of the devout.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"47","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>return to the direct address to the Children of Israel</strong>, echoing the opening of verse 40. It reiterates the reminder \"<strong>Remember My favour which I have bestowed on you</strong>,\" emphasizing past blessings and privileges. It also adds the statement \"<strong>and that I have preferred you over all people</strong>,\" indicating a historical distinction or special status granted to them. This reminder of past favor serves as context for the subsequent messages and expectations directed towards them. It connects back to the initial call in this passage and prepares for further instructions or reflections on their responsibilities and choices. The next verse will likely build upon this reminder of past favor.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"48","text":"And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"Following the reminder of past favor, this verse warns the <strong>Children of Israel</strong> to \"<strong>Fear the day</strong>\" (likely referring to the Day of Judgment) when individual accountability will be paramount. It emphasizes that on this day \"<strong>no soul shall avail another in any way</strong>,\" meaning no one can take responsibility for someone else's deeds or offer them protection. It also states that \"<strong>nor shall ransom be accepted from any of them</strong>,\" indicating that worldly possessions or sacrifices cannot atone for misdeeds. Furthermore, it says \"<strong>nor shall intercession be of any benefit</strong>,\" implying that no one can plead on their behalf effectively without God's permission (this is a nuance often elaborated upon in Islamic theology but here presented as a general point about individual accountability). Finally, it concludes with \"<strong>and none shall receive help</strong>,\" underscoring the complete dependence on God's judgment on that day. This verse serves as a strong warning against complacency based on past favors and emphasizes the importance of individual actions and faith in the present life. It transitions to the next verses which will likely provide historical examples or further elaborations.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"49","text":"And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive.

The verse concludes by stating \"<strong>And in that was a great trial from your Lord</strong>,\" suggesting that even amidst hardship, there was a test of their faith and perseverance. This verse provides a concrete historical example of the \"favour\" mentioned in the previous verse (47) and sets the context for further recounting of their history in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَاكُمْ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَاءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلَاءٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"50","text":"And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.","commentary":"This verse continues the recounting of God's favors upon the <strong>Children of Israel</strong>, following the reminder of their deliverance from Pharaoh's torment in the previous verse. It recalls the miraculous event \"<strong>when We parted the sea for you and saved you</strong>,\" a clear reference to the well-known story of their escape from Pharaoh. It then describes the consequence for their oppressors: \"<strong>and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on</strong>.\" This dramatic scene emphasizes the power of God in delivering the believers and punishing their enemies, and it would have been a vivid reminder for the <strong>Children of Israel</strong> of God's intervention in their history. This verse further illustrates the \"favour\" mentioned earlier and reinforces the expectation of their gratitude and obedience. The narrative will likely continue with more events from their history or transition to the lessons to be drawn from these experiences.","arabic":"وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ الْبَحْرَ فَأَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"51","text":"And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights.

It recalls \"<strong>when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights</strong>,\" referring to the period Moses spent receiving divine guidance. The verse then states, \"<strong>Then you took the calf [for worship] after him, while you were wrongdoers</strong>,\" highlighting an instance where the Israelites deviated from the monotheistic teachings during Moses' absence by worshipping a golden calf. This verse follows the examples of God's favor and their deliverance by presenting an instance of their shortcomings and unfaithfulness. The next verse will likely address the consequences or reactions to this act of wrongdoing.","arabic":"وَإِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"52","text":"Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.","commentary":"This verse directly follows the mention of the <strong>Children of Israel</strong> worshipping the calf and acknowledges their wrongdoing.

This verse contrasts with the previous one, highlighting both their fallibility and God's compassion.

They add a condition to their eventual obedience: \"<strong>[If you do], God willing, we will be guided.</strong>\" This implies that even with further clarification, their ability to follow through depends on God's will. This verse follows their inquiry about the cow's color (verse 69), highlighting their continued search for more distinguishing features, suggesting a potential hesitancy in fulfilling the initial command. The narrative in the following verses will likely reveal the final specifications or the ultimate purpose behind this command.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ الْبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّا إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' \" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.","commentary":"This verse concludes a narrative concerning a command given to the Israelites. The story was presented as a test of faith and obedience.

This community showed significant opposition to the message of Islam upon its arrival. They actively resisted what they perceived as a threat to their moral and economic influence. The rise of Islam also began to unify previously rival Arab tribes, reducing the opportunities for exploitation that the Jewish community had previously benefited from. This verse, along with the following ones, likely condemns their initial rejection of the new revelations. It follows the narrative thread of God's dealings with previous communities and sets the stage for further critique of the Israelites' behavior.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْسًا فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا ۖ وَاللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"So, We said, \"Strike the slain man with part of it.\" Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.","commentary":"Continuing the direct address to the Israelites, this verse likely further censures their actions. The commentary mentions their deliberate confusion of truth and falsehood, and their attempts to conceal the truth found in their own scriptures. It also highlights their efforts to mislead newcomers to Islam and to create division within the nascent Muslim community. This verse builds upon the previous one by detailing the specific ways in which the Israelites were perceived to be opposing the new faith. It leads into a call for them to join the believers.","arabic":"فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُحْيِي اللَّهُ الْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder.

It serves as a reminder that their actions and intentions are known. This follows the criticism of their rejection of the new revelations, their attempts to distort truth, and their efforts to mislead others. The verse acts as a strong concluding statement to this part of the discourse, preceding an invitation for them to adopt prayer and charitable giving.","arabic":"ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَاءُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?","commentary":"While the sources within this range do not explicitly comment on verses 75 and 76, the overall flow suggests a continuation of the critique of the Israelites. The subsequent discussion emphasizes the importance of actions validating words, drawing attention to the attitude of those who claim to hear but disobey. It's likely that verses 75 and 76 would have continued this theme, possibly highlighting discrepancies between the Israelites' claims and their actual behavior. This sets the stage for a more general principle about the relationship between belief and action.","arabic":"أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?","commentary":"While the sources within this range do not explicitly comment on verses 75 and 76, the overall flow suggests a continuation of the critique of the Israelites. The subsequent discussion emphasizes the importance of actions validating words, drawing attention to the attitude of those who claim to hear but disobey. It's likely that verses 75 and 76 would have continued this theme, possibly highlighting discrepancies between the Israelites' claims and their actual behavior. This sets the stage for a more general principle about the relationship between belief and action.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوا أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُمْ بِمَا فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَاجُّوكُمْ بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"But do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?","commentary":"The passage transitions here to address the believers directly, moving away from the critique of the Israelites. This verse marks the beginning of a new section focused on the social structure of the Muslim community during its early formation in Madinah, alongside certain aspects of their religious practices. The themes of social organization and worship are interconnected, linked by the underlying principle of being mindful of God (\"taqwā\"), a concept emphasized at the end of this section and in the preceding verse (which the source identifies as verse 177). This verse specifically introduces the concept of just retribution in cases of killing, outlining a principle of fairness and the possibility of reconciliation. It sets the stage for further regulations concerning social conduct within the community.","arabic":"أَوَلَا يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion on social organization, this verse elaborates on the principle of just retribution introduced in the previous verse (which the source labels as verse 178). It mentions that if the offender is forgiven by the victim's brother (representing the family), the matter should be pursued with fairness, and restitution should be made in a good way. This highlights the balance between justice and the possibility of forgiveness within the community. The commentary notes that this detailed discussion is not for legal debate but to emphasize the importance of cultivating a healthy attitude, conscience, and high standards of behavior within the worshippers. It connects to the preceding verse by providing a specific example of social regulation within the community. The following verses will likely continue to outline such principles.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.","commentary":"This verse (which the source labels as part of verses 178-179) emphasizes the purpose behind the law of just retribution: to preserve life and foster a sense of being mindful of God within the community. It directly follows the outline of the retribution principle, explaining its underlying wisdom and benefit to society. The commentary underscores that Islam must be adopted in its entirety, accepting both firm and lenient instructions with trust in divine mercy and wisdom, always aiming to enhance the sense of God-consciousness. This verse acts as a rationale for the social regulation being introduced and connects to the subsequent verses by setting the tone for further instructions grounded in faith.","arabic":"فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"","commentary":"Building upon the previous verses concerning social justice, verse 80 (though not explicitly quoted here) would likely continue to outline aspects of the developing Muslim community's life or principles of faith. The commentary emphasizes that the regulations being presented are part of an integral system where social systems, laws, and religious rituals stem from faith and a comprehensive worldview centered on the submission and veneration of God. This verse and those preceding and following it illustrate the interconnectedness of different aspects of Islamic life, from matters of justice to personal worship, all unified by the goal of living in accordance with divine guidance and fostering a God-conscious community.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَةً ۚ قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ عَهْدًا فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ ۖ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse follows an overview that mentions the interconnectedness of social organization and religious worship within the Islamic framework. It likely continues to emphasize this connection, highlighting that these aspects are not separate but rather <strong>integral parts of a cohesive system</strong>. The commentary suggests that the subsequent instructions are linked by the underlying principle of <strong>God-consciousness (taqwā)</strong>, which was also noted at the end of the previous discussion. This verse likely sets the stage for further elaboration on this integrated approach.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"While this verse provided in the source is actually verses 178-179, the commentary around page 181 discusses the broader principle of <strong>just retribution</strong> that would likely be introduced around verse 82 in a sequential understanding of legal and social directives. This verse establishes the concept of <strong>fairness and proportionality in dealing with cases of killing</strong>. It also introduces the possibility of <strong>remission</strong> by the victim's kin, emphasizing <strong>fairness and amicable resolution</strong>. The commentary highlights that this law is intended to promote <strong>life and God-consciousness</strong>. This verse likely connects to the preceding discussion by providing a concrete example of social organization guided by divine principles, and it would lead into further specific instructions for the community.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.","commentary":"This verse would likely continue the theme of establishing guidelines for the community. The commentary around this point emphasizes that the <strong>detailed discussions and rulings</strong> in this section are not merely for legal understanding but aim to <strong>cultivate the individual's conscience, improve their actions, and elevate their overall behavior</strong>. It underscores the idea that religious practice should have a positive impact on all aspects of life. This verse likely serves as a bridge between specific legal principles and their broader ethical implications for the community.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ لَا تَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed each other's blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.","commentary":"While this statement in the source describes a broader section, a verse around this point (conceptually verse 84 in the flow of instructions) would likely be part of the <strong>laying down of rules and principles</strong> mentioned. The commentary emphasizes the <strong>concise and clear style</strong> of these instructions and their connection to <strong>faith, rituals, and even matters like conflict</strong>. It highlights that these diverse aspects are interwoven with reminders of the divine. This verse likely illustrates the comprehensive nature of the guidance being provided to the community.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لَا تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ وَلَا تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.","commentary":"The provided verses here (194, 195, 196, 197, 203) are later in the Surah, but conceptually, a verse around 85 would likely continue to provide specific instructions, and as indicated by the commentary related to these later verses, it would likely include an <strong>exhortation to God-consciousness (taqwā)</strong>. The commentary shows that this theme is consistently emphasized alongside various directives, including spending wealth and performing religious rituals. This verse would likely demonstrate the recurring pattern of linking practical guidance with the fundamental principle of fearing God.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِنْ يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ ۚ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ ۚ فَمَا جَزَاءُ مَنْ يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"Similar to verse 84's commentary, this statement describes a broader segment, but conceptually, a verse around 86 would likely be part of the body of <strong>interconnected instructions</strong>. The commentary stresses that these instructions cover a wide range of human life, from personal matters to broader community and even international aspects. It emphasizes the <strong>unity and comprehensiveness of the system</strong>, where spiritual and practical life are integrated through divinely ordained rules and laws. This verse would likely highlight the holistic nature of the guidance.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ ۖ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.","commentary":"This commentary introduces a new phase in the chapter where <strong>questions from the early Muslim community to the Prophet Muhammad</strong> become a prominent feature. A verse around 87 would likely mark the beginning of this trend or describe this inquisitiveness. The commentary highlights the <strong>genuine desire of the new believers to understand their faith in practical terms</strong> and how it applies to their daily lives and the world around them. This verse marks a shift towards addressing specific concerns and seeking clarity on various issues.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ ۖ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.","commentary":"While this is a more general discussion about the nature of the Qur'an, a verse around 88 might arise from or lead into questions about the relationship between faith and worldly knowledge. The commentary emphasizes that the <strong>Qur'an's primary focus is on humanity, character, conscience, and a framework for life</strong>, rather than being a detailed scientific textbook. It suggests that the human intellect is capable of exploring the natural world. This verse likely clarifies the scope and purpose of the divine guidance, differentiating it from specific scientific or technical details, and underscores the importance of human inquiry within a moral framework.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ ۚ بَلْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلًا مَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.","commentary":"Continuing the discussion from the previous point, a verse around 89 might address the appropriate approach to understanding divine guidance in light of human knowledge. The commentary cautions against <strong>forced interpretations of religious texts to align with speculative scientific theories</strong>. However, it also advocates for <strong>utilizing human sciences to gain a better understanding of the Qur'an</strong>. This verse likely seeks to establish a balanced perspective on the relationship between faith and reason, warning against overreach while acknowledging the value of human knowledge.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُوا مِنْ قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ مَا عَرَفُوا كَفَرُوا بِهِ ۚ فَلَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"The provided verses here (190-195) are again later in the Surah, but conceptually, a verse around 90 would likely transition into <strong>directives related to conflict and the use of resources</strong>. The commentary indicates that this section addresses <strong>fighting for a just cause against those who initiate aggression</strong>, while also <strong>prohibiting aggression</strong>. It connects this to the <strong>importance of spending wealth for the cause of God</strong>. This verse likely begins to outline principles of engagement and the ethical considerations involved in defending the community and upholding its values, linking it to the broader themes of justice and God-consciousness.","arabic":"بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَنْ يَكْفُرُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بَغْيًا أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ فَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ ۚ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ"},{"verse":"91","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"","commentary":"This verse describes a response from some people of earlier scriptures when invited to accept Islam. They stated that <strong>they only believed in what was revealed to them previously and rejected other revelations</strong>, even though the new message was described as being in accordance with their own scriptures. This verse highlights a point of contention where some individuals were unwilling to accept a new revelation that they saw as external to their existing beliefs, despite its corroborating nature. It connects to the preceding verses which detail various interactions and disagreements, and sets the stage for further critique of this particular viewpoint.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُوا نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَاءَهُ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَاءَ اللَّهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this segment questions the sincerity of the claim that they only believed in earlier revelations. It points to historical events where <strong>prophets recognized by their own tradition were harmed or killed</strong>. It also references the <strong>incident of the golden calf</strong> during the time of Moses, highlighting a past transgression despite clear guidance. Furthermore, it recalls a covenant where they were instructed to adhere firmly to their received scripture but responded with outward compliance and inner disobedience. The passage concludes by questioning the nature of their faith if such actions were part of their history. This builds upon the rejection described in the previous verse by challenging the basis of their selective belief and leads into further examination of their attitudes and claims.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مُوسَىٰ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"","commentary":"This concluding statement of the segment is a strong <strong>rebuke of the selective acceptance of divine guidance</strong>. It suggests that if their actions of rejecting and even harming prophets, alongside past transgressions, are indicative of their faith, then that faith itself is questionable. This verse directly follows the historical references and the account of disobedience, serving as a condemnation of their inconsistent approach to divine messages. It precedes further exposure of their claims and motivations.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاسْمَعُوا ۖ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ ۚ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"Say, [O Muhammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse addresses a claim that <strong>some believed they were exclusively entitled to paradise</strong>. To challenge this assertion, the verse instructs the Prophet to propose a <strong>joint prayer</strong> where both groups would ask God to bring death upon whoever was falsely claiming this exclusivity. The logic behind this challenge is that if they were truly certain of their exclusive claim to paradise, they would not fear death and might even welcome it as a quicker path to their guaranteed abode. This verse follows the critique of their selective belief by exposing another of their claims and setting up a direct challenge to its validity. The subsequent verse reveals their response to this challenge.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ كَانَتْ لَكُمُ الدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse reveals the <strong>outcome of the challenge proposed in the previous verse</strong>: they would not wish for death. The commentary suggests this reluctance stemmed from an awareness that their claims were unfounded and a fear of divine retribution for their wrongdoings. The verse emphasizes that their actions in this life were the reason for their unwillingness to face what might come after death. It follows the proposition of the challenge by describing the reaction and providing a reason for it, leading into a broader observation about their attachment to worldly life.","arabic":"وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.","commentary":"This verse makes a general observation about their <strong>strong attachment to worldly life</strong>, even exceeding that of those who do not believe in an afterlife. It notes a desire for a very long life, even though longevity would not shield them from potential consequences for their actions. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>God is fully aware of everything they do</strong>. This follows the description of their fear of death by providing a broader characteristic of their behavior and reiterates divine awareness of their actions, setting the stage for a discussion of their rejection of new revelations.","arabic":"وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ النَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا ۚ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَنْ يُعَمَّرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur'an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a potential objection or source of opposition related to the <strong>angel Gabriel</strong>, who is described as the means through which the Quran was revealed to the Prophet. It states that anyone who harbors enmity towards Gabriel should be aware that the Quran's revelation is by God's will and that it <strong>confirms previous scriptures</strong> and offers guidance and positive news for those who believe. This verse follows the discussion of their attachment to life and their actions, addressing a specific aspect of the new revelation that might have been a point of contention. The subsequent verse continues to list those who are considered enemies of God and His message.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.","commentary":"Building upon the previous verse, this verse broadens the scope by stating that <strong>anyone who is an enemy to God, His angels (specifically mentioning Gabriel and Michael), and His messengers will find God to be an adversary of those who reject faith</strong>. This verse reinforces the divine authority behind the revelations and the consequences for those who oppose it and its messengers. It follows the mention of Gabriel and the Quran's confirmation of earlier scriptures by outlining the implications of opposing the divine message and its various agents. The next verse shifts to describing the nature of the revelations themselves.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِلَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَالَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the <strong>clarity of the revelations</strong> that have been sent down. It states that <strong>only those who are inherently wicked or rebellious will deny these clear proofs</strong>. This verse follows the declaration of God's enmity towards those who oppose Him and His messengers by focusing on the nature of the message itself and the type of people who would reject it. The subsequent verse discusses a consistent pattern of breaking pledges.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ ۖ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَا إِلَّا الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.","commentary":"This verse raises a question about a recurring pattern of <strong>breaking solemn pledges or covenants</strong>. It suggests that this tendency to violate commitments indicates a deeper issue: that <strong>most of them do not truly believe</strong>. This verse follows the statement about the clarity of the revelations and their rejection by evildoers by pointing to a specific behavior that further exemplifies a lack of genuine faith. It sets the stage for the following verses which will continue to describe their actions and attitudes towards divine messages.","arabic":"أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُوا عَهْدًا نَبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].","commentary":"This verse speaks about the arrival of <strong>a new messenger (understood as Prophet Muhammad)</strong> with a message that <strong>validated their existing scriptures</strong>.

But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them.

It leads to the final verse in this set, which repeats the command with an additional purpose.","arabic":"وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۖ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"150","text":"And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you, except for those of them who commit wrong; so fear them not but fear Me. And [it is] so I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided.","commentary":"This verse once again commands: <strong>\"And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram.\"</strong> It provides a reason for this command: <strong>\"so that the people will have no argument against you, except for those of them who are wrongdoers.\"</strong> This suggests that establishing a clear and unified direction of prayer removes a potential point of contention. The verse then instructs, <strong>\"So do not fear them but fear Me,\"</strong> emphasizing reverence for God above human criticism. Finally, it states that this command is also <strong>\"[so] that I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided,\"</strong> linking the direction of prayer to divine favor and guidance. This verse concludes this section on the change of qiblah by reiterating the command, explaining its purpose in silencing arguments, urging fear of God, and linking it to the completion of divine favor and guidance.","arabic":"وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِي وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ"}];
