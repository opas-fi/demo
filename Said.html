    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"Alif, Lam, Meem.","commentary":"This verse consists of <strong>three Arabic letters</strong>. The meaning and significance of these letter combinations that appear at the beginning of some chapters (Surahs) of the Quran are a subject of various interpretations. One view is that they serve to <strong>highlight the miraculous nature of the Quran</strong>. Despite being composed of the same Arabic letters used by people, no one can produce a work of similar excellence and impact. This verse stands as the <strong>opening of the second chapter</strong>, immediately setting it apart and prompting reflection on its unique qualities. It connects to the following verse by introducing \"the Book\" that is being referred to.","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -","commentary":"This verse introduces the Quran as <strong>\"the Book\"</strong>, emphasizing its divine origin and significance. The statement <strong>\"there is no doubt about it\"</strong> underscores its truth and authenticity from the perspective of faith. It is further described as <strong>\"a guidance For the God-fearing,\"</strong> indicating that those who are conscious of and have reverence for Allah will find direction and wisdom within its teachings. This verse builds upon the first by identifying the letter combination as the beginning of a profound and trustworthy scripture. It sets the stage for the subsequent verses by describing the intended recipients of this guidance.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"3","text":"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,","commentary":"This verse begins to describe the characteristics of <strong>\"the God-fearing\"</strong> mentioned in the previous verse. The first quality is <strong>\"belief in what lies beyond the reach of human perception,\"</strong> referring to aspects of existence that cannot be directly experienced through the senses but are accepted through faith. The verse also mentions <strong>\"observe Prayer\"</strong> and <strong>\"give of what We bestow upon them,\"</strong> indicating the importance of worship andcharity as practical expressions of their faith. This verse elaborates on the nature of those who benefit from the Quran's guidance, connecting to the previous verse by providing specific attributes. It leads into the next verse by further detailing their beliefs.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].","commentary":"Continuing the description of the God-fearing, this verse highlights their <strong>belief in the divine messages revealed to Prophet Muhammad</strong> as well as <strong>those that came before him</strong>, suggesting a continuity of divine guidance. They also possess <strong>\"certainty of the Hereafter,\"</strong> a firm conviction in the life after death and the Day of Judgement. This verse builds upon the previous one by adding further essential elements of their faith. It connects to the following verse by summarizing the overall outcome of these qualities.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"5","text":"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>conclusion to the description of the God-fearing</strong>. It affirms that those who possess the qualities mentioned in the preceding verses – belief in the unseen, observance of prayer, giving in charity, belief in all divine revelations, and certainty of the Hereafter – are indeed <strong>\"following their Lord’s guidance\"</strong> and <strong>\"shall surely prosper.\"</strong> This prosperity is understood to encompass both spiritual and worldly well-being. This verse directly follows and summarizes the characteristics outlined in verses 3 and 4. It then contrasts with the description of the unbelievers that follows in the next verses.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"6","text":"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.","commentary":"This verse introduces a <strong>contrasting group: the unbelievers</strong>. It states that <strong>warning them or not warning them has the same result</strong>, as they are determined not to accept faith. This highlights their closed-mindedness and resistance to divine guidance. This verse stands in direct contrast to the description of the God-fearing in the preceding verses, emphasizing the different responses to the message. It sets the stage for the next verse, which further elaborates on the state of the unbelievers.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنْذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"7","text":"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.","commentary":"This verse further describes the condition of the unbelievers. The phrase <strong>\"Allah has sealed their hearts and ears\"</strong> is a metaphor for their <strong>inability or unwillingness to understand and accept the truth</strong>. It does not imply a literal sealing but rather a state of spiritual deafness and blindness. <strong>\"Their eyes are covered\"</strong> reinforces this idea of a lack of spiritual insight. The verse concludes with the statement that <strong>\"a grievous punishment awaits them,\"</strong> indicating the consequences of their rejection. This verse builds upon the previous one by providing a metaphorical depiction of the unbelievers' state and their ultimate fate. It transitions to the next verses by introducing a third group: the hypocrites.","arabic":"خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ ۖ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَارِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"8","text":"And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day,\" but they are not believers.","commentary":"This verse introduces a <strong>third group: those who outwardly claim to believe in Allah and the Last Day, but \"in truth, they do not believe.\"</strong> These are the hypocrites, whose inner state does not align with their outward declarations. This verse follows the description of the unbelievers, presenting another category of people who do not genuinely embrace faith. It leads into the subsequent verses, which further detail the characteristics and motivations of these hypocrites.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"9","text":"They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>hypocrites' attempt to deceive Allah and the believers</strong>. However, it emphasizes that <strong>\"they are only deceiving themselves,\"</strong> as Allah is fully aware of their true intentions. Their efforts to mislead others ultimately lead to their own spiritual detriment, even if they are unaware of this consequence. This verse elaborates on the insincerity introduced in the previous verse, highlighting the futility of their deception. It connects to the following verse by describing the underlying reason for their hypocrisy.","arabic":"يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.","commentary":"This verse explains the root cause of the hypocrites' behavior as <strong>\"sickness in their hearts,\"</strong> a metaphor for moral and spiritual corruption. It states that <strong>\"Allah has aggravated their sickness,\"</strong> implying that their continued hypocrisy further entrenches their negative state. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>\"painful suffering awaits them for the lies they keep telling,\"</strong> highlighting the consequences of their deceitful nature. This verse builds upon the previous one by identifying the internal ailment driving their hypocrisy and its resulting punishment. It leads into the next verses, which provide further examples of their corrupt behavior.","arabic":"فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ"},{"verse":"11","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Do not cause corruption on the earth,\" they say, \"We are but reformers.\"","commentary":"This verse illustrates a specific characteristic of the hypocrites: <strong>when advised not to cause corruption, they falsely claim to be doing good</strong>. This highlights their self-deception and their distorted perception of their own actions. They fail to recognize the negative impact of their behavior on society. This verse provides a concrete example of the \"sickness in their hearts\" mentioned in the previous verse. It connects to the following verse, which directly refutes their false claim.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.","commentary":"This verse directly refutes the hypocrites' claim in the previous verse, stating emphatically that <strong>\"they indeed are the ones who do spread corruption,\"</strong> even if <strong>\"they do not realize it.\"</strong> This underscores the severity of their actions and their blindness to the truth of their own negative impact. Their lack of genuine faith distorts their understanding of right and wrong. This verse directly responds to the hypocrites' assertion in the preceding verse. It leads into the next verse, which presents another example of their flawed reasoning.","arabic":"أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"13","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe as the people have believed,\" they say, \"Should we believe as the foolish have believed?\" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.","commentary":"This verse reveals the <strong>arrogance and contempt</strong> of the hypocrites towards genuine believers. When urged to <strong>\"Believe as other people have believed,\"</strong> meaning to embrace sincere faith, they retort with <strong>\"Are we to believe as the fools believe?\"</strong> This reflects their misguided perception that true believers are foolish. The verse then counters this by stating <strong>\"It is indeed they who are fools, though they do not know it,\"</strong> highlighting their own lack of understanding and wisdom. This verse provides another example of the hypocrites' negative characteristics, building upon the theme of their self-deception. It connects to the following verse, which describes their two-faced behavior.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا كَمَا آمَنَ النَّاسُ قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَا آمَنَ السُّفَهَاءُ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاءُ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"14","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We believe\"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, \"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.\"","commentary":"This verse exposes the <strong>duplicity</strong> of the hypocrites. <strong>\"When they meet the believers, they say, ‘We believe’,\"</strong> showing an outward pretense of faith for their own benefit or to avoid negative consequences. However, <strong>\"when they are alone with their devilish allies,\"</strong> those who share their insincerity and opposition to faith, <strong>\"they say, ‘We are with you, we are only mocking’.\"</strong> This reveals their true allegiance and their deceitful manipulation of the believers. This verse illustrates the two-faced nature of the hypocrites, building on the previous descriptions of their insincerity and arrogance. It leads into the next verse, which describes Allah's response to their behavior.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ"},{"verse":"15","text":"[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.","commentary":"This verse describes <strong>Allah's response to the hypocrites' mockery</strong>. <strong>\"Allah will put them to derision\"</strong> signifies that their attempts to mock believers will ultimately result in their own humiliation and disgrace. <strong>\"And let them continue their transgression, blundering blindly along\"</strong> indicates that they will be left to persist in their misguided ways, without true guidance, until the consequences of their actions manifest. This verse directly follows the description of the hypocrites' mocking behavior in the previous verse, outlining the divine consequence. It connects to the following verse, which summarizes the ultimate outcome of their choices.","arabic":"اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ"},{"verse":"16","text":"Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>summary of the hypocrites' situation</strong>. <strong>\"These are the ones who barter away guidance for error\"</strong> highlights their deliberate choice to reject the truth and follow falsehood. <strong>\"Their transaction is profitless\"</strong> emphasizes that this exchange yields no benefit but only loss. <strong>\"And they will receive no guidance\"</strong> indicates that as a consequence of their rejection, they will be deprived of true direction. This verse concludes the detailed description of the hypocrites, summarizing their fundamental error and its consequences. It transitions to the next verses by using a parable to further illustrate their condition.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.","commentary":"This verse presents the first of two parables used to illustrate the situation of the hypocrites. <strong>\"They are like one who sought to kindle a fire, and as it lit up all around him Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see anything.\"</strong> This parable suggests that the hypocrites may have initially experienced some superficial understanding or benefit from the truth, but because of their insincerity, that light was extinguished, leaving them in complete spiritual darkness and confusion. This verse builds upon the summary in the previous verse by providing a vivid analogy of the hypocrites' plight. It connects to the following verse by continuing the description of their state.","arabic":"مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ"},{"verse":"18","text":"Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the hypocrites using metaphorical language. <strong>\"Deaf, dumb and blind\"</strong> symbolizes their <strong>inability or unwillingness to hear the truth, to speak it, or to see it</strong>. The statement <strong>\"they can never return to the right path\"</strong> underscores the severity of their condition, suggesting that their chosen course has led them so far astray that repentance and true guidance become exceedingly difficult. This verse elaborates on the state of darkness described in the previous parable, emphasizing the extent of their spiritual deprivation. It connects to the following verses by introducing a second parable to further illustrate their wavering and confused state.","arabic":"صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"19","text":"Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>second parable</strong> to describe the hypocrites. <strong>\"Or, when there is a storm-cloud, dark, charged with thunder and lightning, they thrust their fingers in their ears at every thunder-clap, for fear of death...\"</strong> This illustrates their <strong>state of anxiety and fear</strong> when confronted with the powerful signs and warnings of Allah. They try to shut themselves off from the truth due to their apprehension and lack of genuine faith. The phrase <strong>\"...but Allah encompasses the unbelievers\"</strong> serves as a reminder of Allah's ultimate power and knowledge over them, regardless of their attempts to avoid the truth. This verse provides another vivid analogy of the hypocrites' internal turmoil and their reaction to divine guidance. It connects to the following verse by continuing this stormy imagery to describe their wavering behavior.","arabic":"أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَاتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِمْ مِنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"20","text":"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse continues the second parable, further depicting the <strong>wavering and indecisive nature of the hypocrites</strong>. <strong>\"The lightning all but snatches away their sight\"</strong> represents the fleeting moments when the truth becomes apparent to them, causing them to act briefly. <strong>\"...whenever it flashes over them they walk on, but when darkness overtakes them they stand still\"</strong> illustrates their lack of consistent commitment and their reversion to inaction and confusion when the clarity fades. The concluding statement, <strong>\"Should Allah will it, He would take away their hearing and their sight, for Allah has power over all things,\"</strong> emphasizes Allah's complete control over their faculties and their ultimate dependence on Him. This verse elaborates on the previous parable, highlighting the inconsistent and fearful response of the hypocrites to the truth. It connects to the following verses by shifting to a direct address to all mankind.","arabic":"يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُمْ مَشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"21","text":"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -","commentary":"This verse marks a <strong>shift in address from the specific groups (believers, unbelievers, hypocrites) to all of \"Mankind.\"</strong> It presents a universal call to <strong>\"worship your Lord who has created you and those who lived before you,\"</strong> emphasizing Allah's role as the sole Creator and sustainer of all humanity throughout history. The purpose of this worship is stated as being <strong>\"so that you may become God-fearing,\"</strong> highlighting that worship is a means to cultivate piety and reverence for Allah. This verse transitions from the parables describing the hypocrites to a broader message for all people. It connects to the following verse by elaborating on Allah's favors upon humanity, which necessitates their worship.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"22","text":"[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>reasons for worshipping Allah</strong>, by highlighting some of His favors upon humanity. <strong>\"He made the earth a couch for you, and the heavens a ceiling\"</strong> emphasizes the provision of a habitable and secure environment. <strong>\"He sent down water from the sky to bring forth fruits for your sustenance\"</strong> points to the provision of life's necessities. Based on these acts of creation and sustenance by the one and only Allah, the verse concludes with a strong admonition: <strong>\"Do not, then, knowingly set up equals to Allah,\"</strong> urging against associating any partners or equals with the one true God. This verse elaborates on the call to worship in the previous verse by listing divine provisions. It connects to the following verses by presenting a challenge to those who doubt the divine origin of the message.","arabic":"الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>direct challenge to those who doubt the divine origin of the Quran</strong>, referred to as <strong>\"what We have revealed to Our servant\"</strong> (Prophet Muhammad). It invites them to <strong>\"produce one surah comparable to it\"</strong>, emphasizing the unique and inimitable nature of the Quran's content and style. The challenge further extends to calling upon <strong>\"all your witnesses, other than Allah,\"</strong> to support their endeavor, <strong>\"if what you say is true.\"</strong> This verse follows the presentation of Allah's creative power and the call to worship, challenging any skepticism towards the divine message. It connects to the following verse by stating the inevitable failure of this challenge and its consequences.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse asserts the <strong>inevitable failure of the challenge</strong> presented in the previous verse, stating <strong>\"But if you fail, as you will certainly do...\"</strong> This underscores the conviction in the Quran's divine origin and its unmatched nature. As a consequence of this failure and continued disbelief, the verse warns to <strong>\"guard yourselves against the fire, fuelled by men and stones, prepared for the unbelievers.\"</strong> This vivid imagery describes the severe punishment awaiting those who reject the truth despite the clear challenge. This verse directly follows the challenge in the previous verse, highlighting its unsurpassable nature and the consequences of failing to accept it. It connects to the following verse by contrasting this warning with the reward promised to believers.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا وَلَنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse offers <strong>\"good tidings\"</strong> of immense reward <strong>\"to those who believe and do good deeds.\"</strong> They are promised <strong>\"gardens through which running waters flow,\"</strong> a description of paradise in Islamic tradition. <strong>\"Whenever they are offered fruits therefrom, they say, ‘We have been given the same before’, for they shall be provided with what looks similar\"</strong> suggests a sense of familiarity yet with a renewed and enhanced experience. They will also have <strong>\"pure spouses\"</strong> and will <strong>\"reside there for ever,\"</strong> highlighting the eternal and pure nature of this reward. This verse presents a stark contrast to the warning of punishment in the previous verse, outlining the blissful destiny of believers. It connects to the following verses by addressing potential questions about the nature and purpose of divine communication, specifically the use of parables.","arabic":"وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ ۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِزْقًا ۙ قَالُوا هَٰذَا الَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ ۖ وَأُتُوا بِهِ مُتَشَابِهًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا أَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ ۖ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, \"What did Allah intend by this as an example?\" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,","commentary":"This verse addresses the <strong>use of parables in the Quran</strong>, clarifying that <strong>\"Allah does not disdain to give a parable of a gnat, or a higher creature.\"</strong> This emphasizes that even seemingly insignificant examples can convey profound truths. <strong>\"Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord,\"</strong> highlighting the acceptance and understanding of believers. <strong>\"While the unbelievers ask, ‘What could Allah mean by such a parable?’\"</strong> reveals their skepticism and lack of comprehension. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>\"In this way, Allah lets many go astray and gives guidance to many others, but none does He leave to go astray except the evildoers,\"</strong> suggesting that the response to divine guidance, even in the form of parables, can be a test that differentiates those who seek truth from those who reject it. This verse follows the description of rewards for believers and punishment for unbelievers, addressing a potential point of confusion or criticism regarding the Quran's style. It connects to the following verse by further defining the characteristics of the evildoers.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ"},{"verse":"27","text":"Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.","commentary":"This verse further defines <strong>\"the evildoers\"</strong> mentioned in the previous verse. They are characterized by three main actions: <strong>\"violate Allah’s covenant after having accepted it,\"</strong> indicating a betrayal of their commitment to God; <strong>\"cut asunder what He has ordered to be joined,\"</strong> referring to the breaking of ties and relationships that Allah has commanded to be maintained; and <strong>\"spread corruption in the land,\"</strong> highlighting their destructive impact on society. The verse concludes by stating <strong>\"They are the losers,\"</strong> emphasizing the negative consequences of their actions in this life and the hereafter. This verse builds upon the previous one by providing specific characteristics of those who go astray. It connects to the following verses, which directly question the disbelief of mankind in Allah.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَنْقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَنْ يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"28","text":"How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses <strong>all of mankind</strong>, questioning their <strong>rejection of Allah</strong>. It presents undeniable facts of human existence as evidence of Allah's power and right to be worshipped. <strong>\"How can you reject Allah who has given you life after you were dead?\"</strong> points to the miracle of creation. <strong>\"He will cause you to die again then He will bring you back to life\"</strong> highlights the cycle of life, death, and resurrection. The verse concludes with the fundamental truth: <strong>\"To Him you shall return,\"</strong> emphasizing the ultimate accountability to Allah. This verse follows the description of the evildoers, shifting the focus back to the universal relationship between Allah and humanity and questioning the basis of disbelief. It connects to the following verse by further highlighting Allah's creation and knowledge.","arabic":"كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَاتًا فَأَحْيَاكُمْ ۖ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"29","text":"It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth.

The verse concludes with the comprehensive statement: <strong>\"He has knowledge of all things,\"</strong> underscoring Allah's complete awareness of everything in existence. This verse builds upon the previous one by providing further evidence of Allah's creative power and knowledge. As it is the last verse in the requested range, it serves as a powerful concluding statement on Allah's role as Creator and Knower.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ ۚ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"30","text":"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\" They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?\" Allah said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a narrative about <strong>Allah's decision to appoint a \"vicegerent\" or steward on Earth</strong>. This suggests that Allah intended to entrust humanity with the responsibility of looking after the planet and fulfilling a specific purpose. The angels, who are presented as beings naturally inclined towards praising and glorifying Allah, question this decision. They express concern that humans might cause disorder and violence on Earth. Allah responds by stating that <strong>His knowledge encompasses things that the angels do not understand</strong>. This sets the stage for the creation of Adam and the demonstration of humanity's unique capabilities.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"31","text":"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"","commentary":"Following the announcement of appointing a vicegerent, this verse describes how <strong>Allah bestowed upon Adam the ability to understand and name all things</strong>. This act highlights humanity's capacity for knowledge and communication, which is presented as a significant distinction. Allah then challenges the angels to name these things, if their earlier concern about humanity's role was based on a complete understanding. This verse connects to the previous one by showing Allah's wisdom in choosing humanity for this role, emphasizing their intellectual potential.","arabic":"وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَاءِ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"32","text":"They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.\"","commentary":"In response to Allah's challenge, the angels acknowledge their limitations and <strong>recognize Allah's infinite knowledge and wisdom</strong>. They admit that their understanding is confined to what Allah has revealed to them. This serves to emphasize the unique knowledge granted to humanity, as mentioned in the previous verse, and further justifies Allah's decision to appoint a vicegerent on Earth.","arabic":"قَالُوا سُبْحَانَكَ لَا عِلْمَ لَنَا إِلَّا مَا عَلَّمْتَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"33","text":"He said, \"O Adam, inform them of their names.\" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\"","commentary":"Allah then instructs Adam to demonstrate his unique ability by naming all the things. After Adam successfully does so, Allah reminds the angels of His comprehensive knowledge, encompassing both the seen and the unseen, the revealed and the concealed. This verse concludes the initial dialogue between Allah and the angels, <strong>affirming Allah's supreme knowledge and highlighting humanity's distinct capacity for understanding and articulation</strong>. It reinforces the rationale behind appointing a human vicegerent on Earth.","arabic":"قَالَ يَا آدَمُ أَنْبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ"},{"verse":"34","text":"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse marks a significant moment where <strong>Allah commands the angels to show respect to Adam</strong>. They all comply with this command. However, one being, referred to as Iblis (often associated with Satan), refuses out of arrogance and a sense of superiority. This refusal is presented as an act of disbelief. This verse introduces the theme of <strong>conflict and temptation</strong> that humanity will face. It follows the demonstration of Adam's knowledge in the previous verses, suggesting that despite humanity's potential, there will be forces that oppose its role and purpose.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"35","text":"And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"","commentary":"Following the events of the previous verse, Allah grants Adam and his spouse permission to reside in Paradise and enjoy its provisions freely. However, they are given <strong>one specific prohibition</strong>: not to approach a particular tree. This is presented as a test of their obedience and free will. This verse connects to the introduction of Iblis in the previous verse, setting up a scenario where temptation and the choice between obedience and disobedience will play a role in human experience.","arabic":"وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"36","text":"But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"","commentary":"This verse describes how <strong>Satan (Iblis), mentioned in the previous verses, successfully tempted Adam and his spouse to disobey Allah's command regarding the tree</strong>. As a consequence of this transgression, they were expelled from Paradise. Allah declares that they will descend to Earth, where they will have a dwelling place and sustenance for a limited time, and where there will be <strong>enmity among themselves</strong>. This verse is a direct consequence of the test set in the previous verse and marks the beginning of human life on Earth, characterized by challenges and conflict.","arabic":"فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ ۖ وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ ۖ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ"},{"verse":"37","text":"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.","commentary":"Despite the transgression in the previous verse, this verse highlights <strong>Allah's mercy and willingness to accept repentance</strong>. Adam receives guidance (\"certain words\") from Allah, through which he repents for his actions, and Allah accepts his repentance. This verse offers a message of hope and emphasizes the possibility of seeking and receiving forgiveness from Allah. It follows the consequence of disobedience in the previous verse, showing that mistakes can be rectified through sincere remorse.","arabic":"فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"38","text":"We said, \"Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse reiterates the descent from Paradise mentioned in Verse 36, addressing Adam, his spouse, and implicitly their descendants (\"You shall all\"). <strong>Allah promises that guidance will be sent to humanity</strong>. The verse states that those who follow this guidance will be secure from fear and sorrow. This verse builds upon the theme of repentance in the previous verse, indicating that despite the initial setback, Allah will provide the means for humanity to live righteously on Earth and attain peace.","arabic":"قُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا مِنْهَا جَمِيعًا ۖ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ مِنِّي هُدًى فَمَنْ تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"39","text":"And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\"","commentary":"This verse presents the <strong>contrast to those who follow Allah's guidance</strong>, as mentioned in the previous verse. It states that those who reject and deny Allah's revelations will face a severe consequence in the afterlife, described as \"the fire,\" where they will remain. This verse concludes this passage by emphasizing the importance of accepting and adhering to the guidance that Allah promises to send. It highlights the consequences of both following and rejecting divine guidance, providing a clear distinction for humanity's choices on Earth.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"40","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.","commentary":"This verse begins a direct address to the <strong>\"Children of Israel,\"</strong> referring to the descendants of Jacob (also known as Israel), which in the context of the time this was revealed, primarily meant the Jewish community living in Medina. <strong>Allah</strong> calls upon them to remember the blessings He has bestowed upon them throughout their history. He asks them to <strong>\"fulfil your covenant with Me,\"</strong> which refers to the agreements made between Allah and their ancestors, and in turn, Allah promises to fulfill His part of the covenant. The verse concludes by emphasizing that they should <strong>\"of Me alone stand in awe,\"</strong> highlighting the importance of reverence and accountability to Allah. This verse serves as an introduction to a series of reminders about their history and their responsibilities.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ"},{"verse":"41","text":"And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it.

They are cautioned <strong>\"be not the first to reject it,\"</strong> suggesting that given their prior knowledge, they should be among the first to recognize its truth. The verse also warns them <strong>\"Do not barter away My revelations for a paltry price,\"</strong> indicating that they should not prioritize worldly gains or narrow interests over accepting divine truth. It ends by reiterating the command to <strong>\"fear Me alone,\"</strong> underscoring the ultimate authority of Allah. This verse builds upon the previous one by specifying what fulfilling the covenant entails: acknowledging and accepting the new message. It also sets the stage for criticisms of their behavior in subsequent verses.","arabic":"وَآمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلَا تَكُونُوا أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا وَإِيَّايَ فَاتَّقُونِ"},{"verse":"42","text":"And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].","commentary":"This verse further addresses the Children of Israel, specifically cautioning them against <strong>\"overlay the truth with falsehood,\"</strong> meaning they should not mix or confuse what is true in their scriptures with false interpretations or beliefs.

It mentions <strong>\"when you said, ‘Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah in person.’\"</strong> This demand to see Allah directly demonstrates a lack of trust in Moses' prophethood. The consequence of this audacious request was that <strong>\"You were then struck by a thunderbolt while you were looking on.\"</strong> This dramatic event served as a powerful demonstration of Allah's power and a consequence of their disbelief. This verse follows the account of repentance, highlighting their continued pattern of questioning and demanding proof.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنْظُرُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.","commentary":"Following the severe consequence of being struck by a thunderbolt, this verse speaks of <strong>Allah's mercy in reviving them</strong>: <strong>\"Then We raised you up after your death.\"</strong> This miraculous revival provided them with another opportunity. The purpose of this act was <strong>\"so that you might give thanks,\"</strong> emphasizing that they should have been grateful for this second chance. This verse directly follows the account of the thunderbolt, illustrating Allah's power to both punish and show mercy, and the expectation of gratitude.","arabic":"ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.","commentary":"This verse recalls further blessings bestowed upon the Children of Israel during their wanderings. <strong>\"We shaded you with clouds\"</strong> provided relief from the desert heat, and <strong>\"sent down to you manna and quails\"</strong> provided sustenance. They were instructed <strong>‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you.’</strong> The verse concludes with a significant statement: <strong>‘And they wronged Us not, but they wronged themselves.’</strong> This implies that their ingratitude and disobedience did not harm Allah but rather had negative consequences for themselves. This verse continues the theme of Allah's favors, emphasizing that despite these provisions, their negative actions ultimately affected only themselves.","arabic":"وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ وَالسَّلْوَىٰ ۖ كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ ۖ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"And [recall] when We said, \"Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.'

As a consequence of this transgression, <strong>\"Therefore, We let loose against them a scourge from heaven in requital for their transgression.\"</strong> This highlights the consequences of failing to adhere to divine commands and the justice of Allah. This verse directly contrasts with the promised rewards in the previous verse, showing what happens when instructions are willfully disregarded.","arabic":"فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا قَوْلًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا رِجْزًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ"},{"verse":"60","text":"And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people knew its watering place. \"Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"","commentary":"This verse recalls another instance of Allah's provision for the Children of Israel in the desert. <strong>\"when Moses prayed for water for his people We said to him, ‘Strike the rock with your staff.’ Twelve springs gushed forth from it,\"</strong> demonstrating a miraculous provision of water to satisfy the needs of their twelve tribes. <strong>\"Each tribe knew their drinking place,\"</strong> ensuring order and preventing conflict. They were instructed <strong>‘Eat and drink of what Allah has provided and do not persistently spread corruption in the land,’</strong> reminding them to be grateful and avoid harmful actions.

They said to Moses, <strong>‘Moses! We can no longer put up with one kind of food. Pray to your Lord, then, to bring forth for us some of what the earth produces of green herbs, cucumber, garlic, lentils and onions.’</strong> Moses responded, <strong>‘Would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is much better?’</strong> implying that the divine provisions were superior. He then told them, <strong>‘Go down to any land and you shall have what you asked for.’</strong> The verse concludes with a harsh statement: <strong>‘Ignominy and humiliation were stamped upon them and they incurred the wrath of Allah, because they denied His revelations and slew prophets against all right, and because they persisted in their disobedience and transgression.’</strong> This highlights their ingratitude and the severe consequences of rejecting divine guidance and committing injustice.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَنْ نَصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْ بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّائِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا ۖ قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ۚ اهْبِطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَا سَأَلْتُمْ ۗ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْا وَكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse presents a broad principle of salvation.

Such people <strong>\"have nothing to fear nor shall they grieve,\"</strong> promising peace and security. This verse offers an inclusive perspective, highlighting the importance of core beliefs and good deeds over mere adherence to a specific religious label. It comes after a series of criticisms of the Children of Israel, perhaps to provide a balanced view of those who truly believe and act righteously.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالنَّصَارَىٰ وَالصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"63","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"","commentary":"This verse recalls another significant event in the history of the Children of Israel: <strong>\"when We accepted your solemn pledge and raised Mount Sinai above you.\"</strong> This dramatic imagery signifies the weight and importance of the covenant they entered into with Allah. They were commanded <strong>‘Take with firmness and strength what We have given you,’</strong> referring to the Torah, and to <strong>‘bear in mind all its contents,’</strong> emphasizing the need to understand and implement its teachings <strong>‘so that you may remain God-fearing.’</strong> This verse highlights the seriousness of their commitment to the divine law and the intended outcome of that commitment. It follows the inclusive message of Verse 62, perhaps to remind the specific group being addressed of their particular responsibilities.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُوا مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"Then you turned away after that.

The verse then emphasizes Allah's continued favor: <strong>\"and but for Allah’s grace and mercy you would have surely been among the losers.\"</strong> This suggests that despite their failings, they were still under Allah's compassion. This verse directly follows the account of the pledge at Mount Sinai, highlighting the contrast between their commitment and their later actions.","arabic":"ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُمْ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"","commentary":"This verse refers to a specific instance of transgression among the Children of Israel: <strong>\"those of you who broke the Sabbath.\"</strong> The Sabbath is a day of rest and religious observance. The consequence of this violation was severe: <strong>\"To them We said, ‘Be as despicable apes.’\"</strong> This serves as a powerful metaphor for their moral and spiritual degradation as a result of disobeying Allah's commands. This verse provides a specific example of how they \"turned away\" as mentioned in the previous verse, illustrating the consequences of disregarding religious obligations.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ الَّذِينَ اعْتَدَوْا مِنْكُمْ فِي السَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah.","commentary":"This verse explains the purpose behind the punishment mentioned in the previous verse. <strong>\"Through that [punishment] We set an example to their own time and for all times to come,\"</strong> indicating that this event was intended as a lesson for both their generation and future generations. It also served as <strong>\"an admonition to the God-fearing,\"</strong> reminding those who are mindful of Allah's commands about the consequences of disobedience. This verse clarifies the didactic nature of the historical accounts presented, showing their relevance beyond the specific time and people involved.","arabic":"فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِلْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant.\"","commentary":"This verse begins a new narrative, often referred to as the story of the cow. It starts with <strong>Moses</strong> conveying a command to his people: <strong>‘Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.’</strong> Their initial response was one of disbelief and mockery: <strong>‘Are you mocking at us?’</strong> Moses, deeply disturbed by their reaction, replied <strong>‘Allah forbid that I should be so ignorant,’</strong> asserting that he would never treat Allah's commands with ridicule. This verse introduces a story that further illustrates the attitude and behavior of the Children of Israel, beginning with their questioning of a clear divine instruction.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُوا بَقَرَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُوًا ۖ قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[Allah] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.\"","commentary":"Continuing the story of the cow, the Children of Israel, instead of readily obeying, asked Moses to <strong>‘Pray on our behalf to your Lord to make plain to us what kind of cow she should be.’</strong> This shows a reluctance to follow the initial simple command. Moses relayed Allah's response: <strong>‘He says let her be neither an old cow nor a young heifer, but of an age in between. Do, then, as you are commanded.’</strong> This provides a more specific description, yet they still hesitate to act. This verse illustrates their tendency to ask for excessive details and delay obedience.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا فَارِضٌ وَلَا بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ فَافْعَلُوا مَا تُؤْمَرُونَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.' \"","commentary":"The Children of Israel continue their inquiries, asking Moses to <strong>‘Pray on our behalf to your Lord to make clear to us of what colour she should be.’</strong> Again, this demonstrates their continued hesitation. Moses conveyed Allah's answer: <strong>‘He says let her be a yellow cow, bright of hue, pleasing to the beholder.’</strong> This provides even more specific information, yet they still do not proceed with the sacrifice. This verse further emphasizes their pattern of seeking more and more details instead of acting on the initial command.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا ۚ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَاءُ فَاقِعٌ لَوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ النَّاظِرِينَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us.

We shall, Allah willing, be guided aright.’</strong> Their statement <strong>\"Allah willing, be guided aright\"</strong> sounds like a positive intention, but it follows more stalling. Moses then provided a very precise description: <strong>‘He says let her be a cow, not broken-in to plough the earth or water the tillage, free of all fault, without markings of any other colour.’</strong> This detailed response finally leaves little room for further ambiguity. This verse highlights their continued procrastination and the increasingly specific demands they make.","arabic":"قَالُوا ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنْ لَنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ الْبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّا إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' \" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.","commentary":"After receiving the highly specific description, the Children of Israel finally acknowledged <strong>‘Now you have given the right description.’</strong> They then <strong>\"sacrificed her,\"</strong> but the verse adds a telling detail: <strong>\"although they had almost left it undone.\"</strong> This implies that they carried out the command reluctantly and after much delay, suggesting a lack of willing obedience. This verse marks the eventual fulfillment of the command but underscores the difficult and hesitant manner in which it was done.\r\n\r\n## Verses 72-73\r\n### Verse 72\r\nHaving slain a human being, you cast the blame on one another for this [murder]. Allah would definitely reveal what you have concealed.\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\nThese verses reveal the underlying reason for the command to sacrifice the cow. <strong>\"Having slain a human being, you cast the blame on one another for this [murder].\"</strong> This indicates that a murder had occurred within their community, and they were trying to conceal the identity of the killer. <strong>\"Allah would definitely reveal what you have concealed,\"</strong> emphasizing that the truth would come to light through divine means. These verses provide the context for the seemingly arbitrary command to sacrifice a cow, connecting it to a need to solve a crime.\r\n\r\n### Verse 73\r\nWe said, ‘Strike him with a piece of it. Thus Allah brings the dead back to life and shows you His signs, so that you may use your reason.’\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\nThis verse describes the miraculous resolution to the murder mystery. <strong>Allah</strong> commanded, <strong>‘Strike him with a piece of it,’</strong> referring to a part of the sacrificed cow. The verse then states the astonishing outcome: <strong>‘Thus Allah brings the dead back to life and shows you His signs, so that you may use your reason.’</strong> The dead man was resurrected briefly to identify his killer, demonstrating Allah's power over life and death and providing a clear sign for them to understand and believe. This verse concludes the story of the cow, revealing its purpose and highlighting a powerful miracle intended to strengthen their faith and understanding.","arabic":"قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لَا ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ الْأَرْضَ وَلَا تَسْقِي الْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لَا شِيَةَ فِيهَا ۚ قَالُوا الْآنَ جِئْتَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ"},{"verse":"74","text":"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder.

The verse further elaborates on the nature of rocks: <strong>\"for there are rocks from which rivers gush forth; others split so that water flows through them, and some other rocks fall down for fear of Allah.\"</strong> This contrasts the natural responsiveness of even inanimate objects to Allah's will with the stubbornness of their hearts. The verse ends with a stern reminder: <strong>\"Indeed, Allah is not unaware of what you do,\"</strong> underscoring Allah's knowledge of their actions and their ultimate accountability. This verse serves as a final indictment of their persistent disbelief despite the overwhelming evidence and divine interventions.","arabic":"ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَاءُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?","commentary":"This verse addresses the early Muslim community and questions their expectation that all members of the People of the Book (referring primarily to Jews and Christians who had received scriptures before Islam) would accept the message of Islam. It points out that <strong>some among those who had received previous divine messages would listen to the revelations of Allah, understand them, but then deliberately alter their meaning</strong>. This verse sets the stage for describing the inconsistencies and challenges faced by the early Muslims in their interactions with some religious groups. It connects to the following verses by highlighting a specific behavior – the intentional misinterpretation of scripture – which will be further elaborated upon with examples of hypocrisy and concealment of truth.","arabic":"أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>hypocritical behavior of some individuals from the People of the Book</strong>. It states that <strong>when they were in the company of the Muslim believers, they would profess belief in Islam</strong>. However, <strong>when they were among themselves, they would question the wisdom of sharing information that Allah had revealed to them (referring to aspects of their own scriptures that might align with or foretell the coming of Islam)</strong>. They feared that the Muslims would use this knowledge to argue against them in religious discussions or on the Day of Judgment. This verse builds upon the previous one by showing another layer of their deceptive practices – outwardly showing agreement while inwardly harboring different intentions. It leads into the next verse by questioning their understanding and awareness of Allah's knowledge.","arabic":"وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَا بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوا أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُمْ بِمَا فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَاجُّوكُمْ بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"But do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>direct question and a reminder that Allah has complete knowledge of everything, both what is openly expressed and what is kept hidden</strong>. It follows the description of the hypocritical behavior in the previous verse, emphasizing that <strong>their attempts to conceal their true beliefs and intentions are futile because Allah is fully aware of them</strong>. This verse connects to the verses before and after by underscoring the ultimate accountability for one's actions and beliefs, regardless of outward appearances. It sets the stage for describing the different segments within the People of the Book.","arabic":"أَوَلَا يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ"},{"verse":"78","text":"And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.","commentary":"This verse begins to differentiate between different groups within the People of the Book. It describes <strong>a segment of them as being uneducated and lacking true understanding of their own scriptures</strong>. Instead, they follow <strong>superstitions, baseless beliefs, and mere speculation</strong>. This verse contrasts with the earlier mention of those who knowingly distort the scriptures (Verse 75) and introduces the idea of ignorance being a factor in their beliefs. It connects to the following verse by highlighting the exploitation of this ignorance by others.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price.

It states that they would <strong>write something with their own hands, falsely claim it to be from Allah, and then use it to obtain something of little value</strong>. The verse issues a strong warning (\"Woe\") against both their act of falsification and the material gains they acquire through it. This verse directly follows the description of the uneducated masses (Verse 78) and highlights how some leaders or scholars would manipulate religious texts for their own purposes, taking advantage of the ignorance of others. It leads to the next verse by addressing another false claim they made.","arabic":"فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَهُمْ مِمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific claim made by some among the People of the Book, who asserted that <strong>if they were to be punished in the afterlife, it would only be for a limited number of days</strong>. The verse instructs the Prophet to challenge this assertion by asking whether they had received such a <strong>promise from Allah</strong> (emphasizing the trustworthiness of Allah's promises) or if they were <strong>attributing something to Allah without any basis in knowledge</strong>. This verse follows the condemnation of those who distort scripture (Verse 79) by highlighting another example of their unfounded beliefs and self-exemption from divine judgment. It connects to the subsequent verses by establishing the principle of accountability based on actions, regardless of their claims of special status.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَةً ۚ قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ عَهْدًا فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ ۖ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>universal principle of accountability</strong>: those who commit evil deeds and are overwhelmed by their sins will be inhabitants of the Fire (hell) forever. It directly refutes the false claim in the previous verse about limited punishment (Verse 80) by stating that the consequence of serious sin is eternal. This verse shifts the focus from the specific claims of a group to a general principle applicable to all. It connects to the following verse by presenting the contrasting outcome for those who believe and do good.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse offers a <strong>contrasting principle of reward</strong>: those who have faith (believe in Allah and His message) and perform good deeds will be inhabitants of Paradise eternally. It provides a clear parallel to the previous verse (Verse 81), outlining the consequences of both evil and good actions. Together, these two verses emphasize the importance of both faith and righteous conduct for salvation, moving away from claims of special privilege based on lineage or religious affiliation alone. This sets the stage for addressing the covenant Allah made with the Children of Israel.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.","commentary":"This verse marks a shift to recalling a <strong>specific covenant that Allah made with the Children of Israel</strong>. It outlines the terms of this covenant, which included: <strong>worshipping only Allah, being good to parents, relatives, orphans, and the needy, speaking kindly to all people, establishing regular prayer, and giving charity (zakah)</strong>. The verse then notes that <strong>most of the Children of Israel turned away from this covenant and were unmindful of their obligations</strong>, except for a few. This verse provides historical context and explains that even with a clear divine agreement, many failed to uphold their commitments. It connects to the verses before by showing that the principle of reward and punishment (Verses 81-82) applies to those who were given a specific divine message and failed to follow it. It leads to the next verse by detailing another aspect of the same covenant.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ لَا تَعْبُدُونَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed each other's blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.","commentary":"This verse continues to recount the <strong>covenant that Allah made with the Children of Israel</strong>, focusing on <strong>the prohibition of bloodshed among themselves and the expulsion of their own people from their homes</strong>. The verse emphasizes that <strong>they acknowledged this part of the covenant and bore witness to it</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one (Verse 83) by detailing further obligations within the divine agreement. It highlights that they were fully aware of these commands. It connects to the next verse by showing the contradiction between their acknowledgment of the covenant and their subsequent actions.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لَا تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ وَلَا تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.","commentary":"This verse points out the <strong>stark contradiction in the actions of the Children of Israel</strong>. It highlights that despite acknowledging the covenant against bloodshed and expulsion (Verse 84), <strong>they were found killing each other, driving some of their own people from their homes, and collaborating in sinful and aggressive acts against them</strong>. Ironically, <strong>if these same people were taken captive, they would pay ransom to free them, even though their initial expulsion was forbidden</strong>. The verse then poses a rhetorical question: <strong>\"Do you believe in a part of the Scripture and disbelieve in another part?\"</strong>, strongly criticizing their selective adherence to divine law. It concludes by stating that <strong>the recompense for such behavior is disgrace in this life and the severest punishment in the hereafter</strong>, emphasizing that <strong>Allah is fully aware of their actions</strong>. This verse directly follows the outlining of the covenant (Verses 83-84) and provides concrete examples of how the Children of Israel violated it, despite their awareness. It connects to the following verse by reiterating the consequences of their actions.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِنْ يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ ۚ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ ۚ فَمَا جَزَاءُ مَنْ يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ ۗ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"This verse explains the underlying motivation behind the inconsistent behavior described in the previous verses (Verse 85). It states that <strong>those who selectively follow divine guidance have essentially chosen the fleeting benefits of this worldly life over the eternal rewards of the Hereafter</strong>. As a consequence of this choice, <strong>their punishment will not be lessened, and they will receive no help or support</strong> on the Day of Judgment. This verse serves as a judgment on those who prioritize worldly gains over their religious obligations and highlights the eternal consequences of such decisions. It connects to the previous verse by explaining the severe punishment mentioned as a result of their misplaced priorities. It leads to the next verse by recounting another instance of Allah's favor upon the Children of Israel and their subsequent reactions.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْآخِرَةِ ۖ فَلَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.","commentary":"This verse shifts to recounting Allah's favor upon the Children of Israel by highlighting the <strong>succession of prophets sent to them</strong>. It mentions that <strong>Moses was given the Scripture (Torah), followed by numerous other messengers</strong>. Specifically, it mentions <strong>Jesus, the son of Mary, who was given clear miracles and supported by the Holy Spirit (believed to be the Angel Gabriel)</strong>. The verse then poses a question, pointing out their historical pattern of <strong>arrogantly rejecting messengers who brought messages that did not align with their desires</strong>. It states that <strong>they denied some of these messengers and even killed others</strong>. This verse provides further historical context of the Children of Israel's interactions with divine guidance, illustrating their resistance and rejection of prophets. It connects to the previous verses by showing their continued pattern of disbelief and disobedience despite receiving clear signs and messengers. It leads to the next verse by describing their reaction to the new message of Islam.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ ۖ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>response of some of the Children of Israel to the message of Islam</strong>. They would say, <strong>\"Our hearts are sealed,\"</strong> implying that they were no longer able to understand or accept new religious teachings. The verse refutes this claim, stating that <strong>it was not that their hearts were sealed, but rather that Allah had distanced them due to their persistent disbelief</strong>. As a result, <strong>their belief was superficial and limited</strong>. This verse directly addresses the reaction to the new message brought by Prophet Muhammad, following the historical overview of previous prophets (Verse 87). It explains that their inability to accept Islam stemmed from their ingrained disbelief, rather than an inherent inability to understand. It connects to the following verse by describing their rejection of the Quran despite recognizing its truth.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ ۚ بَلْ لَعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلًا مَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.","commentary":"This verse highlights the <strong>paradoxical behavior of some among the People of the Book upon the arrival of the Quran</strong>. It notes that <strong>a Book (the Quran) came to them from Allah, confirming the scriptures they already possessed</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>prior to this, they used to pray for the coming of a prophet who would help them gain victory over non-believers</strong>. However, <strong>when the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad came, whom they recognized (from prophecies in their own scriptures), they rejected them</strong>. Consequently, the verse states, <strong>\"so may the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers.\"</strong> This verse underscores their hypocrisy – longing for a prophet whose arrival they then denied when he actually appeared. It builds upon the previous verse by showing that their disbelief extended to the Quran, even though it aligned with their own scriptures. It connects to the next verse by describing the miserable outcome of their rejection.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُوا مِنْ قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ مَا عَرَفُوا كَفَرُوا بِهِ ۚ فَلَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"90","text":"How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>miserable outcome of the disbelief of some among the People of the Book</strong>. It emphasizes <strong>how poorly they have traded their souls by rejecting what Allah has revealed (the Quran) out of envy</strong>. Their envy stemmed from <strong>Allah's choice to bestow His favor (prophethood and revelation) upon whomever He wills among His servants (Prophet Muhammad)</strong>, who was not from their lineage in the way they expected. As a result of their envy and disbelief, <strong>they have incurred multiple layers of Allah's displeasure (\"wrath upon wrath\")</strong>, and <strong>for such disbelievers is a humiliating punishment</strong> awaiting them. This verse explains the underlying motivation – envy – for their rejection of Islam and highlights the severe consequences of this envy and disbelief. It connects to the previous verse by further elaborating on the \"curse of Allah\" with the concept of \"wrath upon wrath\" and \"humiliating punishment.\" It leads to the next verse by describing their selective belief in their own scriptures.","arabic":"بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَنْ يَكْفُرُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بَغْيًا أَنْ يُنَزِّلَ اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۖ فَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ ۚ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ"},{"verse":"91","text":"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"","commentary":"This verse further exposes the <strong>selective belief of some among the People of the Book</strong>. It states that <strong>when they were asked to believe in what Allah had revealed (the Quran)</strong>, <strong>they would reply that they only believed in what was revealed to them (their own scriptures)</strong>. They would <strong>reject the Quran and the message of Prophet Muhammad, even though the Quran confirms the core teachings of their own scriptures</strong>. The verse then instructs the Prophet to challenge their claim of true belief by asking: <strong>\"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were [indeed] believers?\"</strong> This rhetorical question highlights the inconsistency between their claim of faith in past revelations and their historical actions of rejecting and even killing prophets who came to them. It directly follows their envious rejection of the Quran (Verse 90) by showing another flaw in their argument for not accepting the new message. It connects to the next verse by recounting another historical transgression.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُوا نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَاءَهُ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَاءَ اللَّهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse recalls a <strong>significant event in the history of the Children of Israel</strong>: the episode of the <strong>golden calf</strong>. It reminds them that <strong>Moses had come to them with clear miracles and evidence of his prophethood</strong>. However, <strong>in his absence (while he was receiving the Torah on Mount Sinai), they turned to worshipping a calf</strong>, thus committing a grave sin and proving themselves to be wrongdoers. This verse serves as another historical reminder of their past transgressions, further undermining their claim of being righteous believers who should not be asked to follow a new prophet or scripture. It follows the questioning of their past actions towards prophets (Verse 91) with a specific example of their idolatry despite witnessing divine signs. It connects to the next verse by mentioning another covenant Allah made with them.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ مُوسَىٰ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ الْعِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"93","text":"And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"","commentary":"This verse recounts another instance of <strong>Allah making a covenant with the Children of Israel</strong>. It reminds them of the time when <strong>Allah raised Mount Sinai above them</strong> (as a powerful demonstration) and commanded them to <strong>take the Torah with determination and to listen to His commands</strong>. However, <strong>their response was, \"We have heard and disobeyed,\"</strong> revealing their rebellious nature. The verse further states that <strong>their hearts were filled with the love of the calf due to their deep-seated disbelief</strong>. Finally, it instructs the Prophet to say: <strong>\"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers,\"</strong> questioning the nature of their faith if it led them to such disobedience and idolatry. This verse continues to highlight their history of disobedience and flawed faith, following the examples of killing prophets (Verse 91) and worshipping the calf (Verse 92). It connects to the following verses by addressing their claim of being Allah's chosen people and their attitude towards death.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاسْمَعُوا ۖ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ ۚ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"94","text":"Say, [O Muhammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>challenge to a specific claim made by some</strong>. The verse states that if they believed their final destination with Allah was exclusively theirs, then they should naturally desire to pass away and reach this anticipated reward. This is because someone confident in a positive afterlife would look forward to it. This verse sets the stage for the following verses which describe their actual feelings about death.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ كَانَتْ لَكُمُ الدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِنْ دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"95","text":"But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse explains the <strong>response to the challenge in the previous verse</strong>. It indicates that those making the claim about an exclusive afterlife would never actually wish for death. The reason given is <strong>their awareness of their own actions and deeds during their lives</strong>. This suggests a lack of confidence in attaining that claimed reward. The verse concludes by stating that Allah is fully aware of those who do wrong, implying a judgment based on their actions. This verse directly follows the challenge in Verse 94 by presenting the expected, or rather, the actual reaction.","arabic":"وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"96","text":"And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this verse further describes <strong>the attitude towards life held by those who made the claim in Verse 94</strong>. It highlights their <strong>intense attachment to this worldly life</strong>, even more so than those who might not believe in an afterlife (idolaters). The verse notes their desire for an exceptionally long life, even though a long life itself would not protect them from the consequences of their actions. The verse ends by reiterating that Allah observes everything they do, reinforcing the idea of accountability. This verse elaborates on why they would not wish for death as stated in Verse 95.","arabic":"وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ النَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا ۚ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَنْ يُعَمَّرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ"},{"verse":"97","text":"Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur'an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a <strong>specific point of contention</strong> that some held regarding the source of the Qur'an. It clarifies that the angel Gabriel, by Allah's permission, revealed the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad. The verse also emphasizes that the Qur'an <strong>supports and affirms the holy books that were revealed before it</strong>. Furthermore, it is described as guidance and good news for those who believe. This verse shifts the focus from their fear of death to their potential objections to the Qur'an itself, setting up the following verse which expands on the consequences of opposing divine messengers.","arabic":"قُلْ مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"98","text":"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.","commentary":"Building on the previous verse, this verse states a <strong>clear principle regarding the reverence of Allah and His messengers</strong>. It declares that anyone who shows enmity towards Allah, His angels (specifically mentioning Gabriel and Michael), or His messengers will find Allah to be an opponent of those who reject faith. This verse reinforces the importance of respecting all aspects of the divine message and its delivery, connecting the opposition to Gabriel in the previous verse to a broader rejection of faith. The verse that follows continues this theme by highlighting the clarity of the revelations and who denies them.","arabic":"مَنْ كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِلَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَالَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"99","text":"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the <strong>nature of the divine messages</strong>, stating that they have been revealed in a clear and understandable manner. It further asserts that <strong>only those who are inherently wicked (evildoers)</strong> will reject these clear revelations. This verse follows the discussion about the messengers and reinforces the idea that rejecting the message is a sign of a deeper issue within the individual. The subsequent verse then points to a pattern of behavior among those who deny these clear messages.","arabic":"وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ ۖ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَا إِلَّا الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"100","text":"Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.","commentary":"This verse points out a <strong>recurring pattern of behavior</strong>. It questions whether it is always the case that whenever solemn promises or agreements are made, some among them will break these commitments. The verse then states that the underlying reason for this behavior is that the majority of them do not truly believe. This verse connects to the previous one by suggesting that the denial of clear revelations (Verse 99) is linked to a general lack of faith and a tendency to disregard commitments. The next verse provides a specific example of this disregard.","arabic":"أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُوا عَهْدًا نَبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ"},{"verse":"101","text":"And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].","commentary":"This verse provides a <strong>specific instance of the broken pledges and lack of belief mentioned in the previous verse</strong>. It describes the arrival of Prophet Muhammad as a messenger from Allah, bringing a message (the Qur'an) that <strong>confirmed the scriptures they already possessed</strong>. Despite this, some of those who were familiar with these earlier scriptures rejected the new message, acting as if they had no knowledge of their own holy books. This verse directly illustrates the point made in Verse 100 about violating commitments and a lack of true belief, setting the stage for the next verses which discuss what some of them chose to follow instead.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"102","text":"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\" And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.","commentary":"This verse explains <strong>what some chose to follow instead of the divine guidance</strong> that confirmed their own scriptures (as mentioned in Verse 101). It addresses <strong>false claims about the reign of King Solomon</strong>, stating that he never rejected faith, but that evil forces (devils) spread misinformation. These forces are described as teaching witchcraft, which was not something revealed to the angels Harut and Marut in Babylon for that purpose. The verse clarifies that these angels were a test and warned against renouncing faith. People learned from these sources things that could cause harm, such as discord in marriages, but emphasizes that such harm can only occur with Allah's permission. The verse concludes by stating that those who pursue such harmful knowledge are learning what is detrimental and brings no benefit in the afterlife, indicating a severe loss. This verse contrasts their rejection of divine guidance with their embrace of harmful practices.","arabic":"وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ ۖ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ ۖ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ ۚ وَمَا هُمْ بِضَارِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنْفَعُهُمْ ۚ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"103","text":"And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been [far] better, if they only knew.","commentary":"This concluding verse of the passage presents a <strong>clear alternative and its superior outcome</strong>. It states that if those who rejected the confirming messenger and scripture (as described in Verses 101 and 102) had instead embraced faith and been mindful of Allah, then Allah's reward would have been far greater for them. The phrase \"if they but knew it\" highlights their lack of understanding of true value and benefit. This verse serves as a final comment on the choices they made and the better path they could have taken, directly following the description of their harmful pursuits in Verse 102.","arabic":"وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ ۖ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"104","text":"O you who have believed, say not [to Allah 's Messenger], \"Ra'ina\" but say, \"Unthurna\" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.","commentary":"This verse addresses the early followers of Islam, instructing them on how to speak to the Prophet Muhammad. It seems that some people were using a certain Arabic word, \"ra`ina,\" which could be interpreted in a disrespectful way, although its primary meaning was \"listen to us\". The verse advises believers to use more respectful language, suggesting phrases like \"Have patience with us\". This was to avoid any unintentional offense or exploitation of language by those who were hostile to the Prophet.\r\n\r\nThis verse sets the tone for the subsequent verses by highlighting the importance of respect and proper conduct within the early Muslim community, especially when interacting with their leader. It also contrasts the believers with \"the unbelievers,\" for whom a severe consequence is mentioned, hinting at the ongoing tensions and opposition faced by the early Muslims.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقُولُوا رَاعِنَا وَقُولُوا انْظُرْنَا وَاسْمَعُوا ۗ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"105","text":"Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.","commentary":"This verse speaks about the <strong>negative sentiments</strong> of those who did not believe in the message of Islam, including both the \"people of earlier revelations\" (referring primarily to Jews and Christians of that time) and the \"idolaters\" (the polytheistic Arabs). It states that these groups were <strong>unhappy to see any good</strong> come to the Muslim community from Allah. This stemmed from <strong>resentment and envy</strong> that Allah had chosen to reveal His final message to Prophet Muhammad and the Arabs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the verse reassures the believers that <strong>Allah bestows His blessings upon whomever He wills</strong>, and His grace is boundless. This serves to comfort the early Muslims and emphasize that divine favor is not dictated by the desires or disapproval of others. It follows the previous verse by explaining the reason behind the \"grievous suffering\" mentioned for the unbelievers – their opposition to divine blessing. The next verse will then address the topic of changes in divine guidance.","arabic":"مَا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَلَا الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَنْ يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ"},{"verse":"106","text":"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?","commentary":"This verse addresses the <strong>issue of changes or modifications in the divine guidance</strong> given to Prophet Muhammad. It clarifies that <strong>Allah has the authority to annul (cancel) or cause to be forgotten any previous revelation and replace it with something better or similar</strong>. This was particularly relevant because some people, possibly the \"unbelievers\" mentioned in the previous verse, were using these changes, such as the change in the direction of prayer (qiblah), to cast doubt on the validity of Islam.\r\n\r\nThe verse emphasizes <strong>Allah's absolute power and control</strong> over all things. This serves to reassure believers that these changes are part of Allah's divine wisdom and plan, and not a sign of inconsistency or weakness in the divine message. It connects to the previous verse by asserting Allah's freedom in bestowing blessings and also in guiding humanity as He sees fit. The following verse will further emphasize Allah's sovereignty.","arabic":"مَا نَنْسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنْسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا ۗ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"107","text":"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?","commentary":"This verse reinforces the <strong>absolute authority and power of Allah</strong>. It states that <strong>Allah has sovereignty over all that exists in the heavens and the earth</strong>. Furthermore, it reminds the believers that <strong>they have no protector or helper besides Allah</strong>. This was likely a <strong>warning to the early Muslim community</strong>, some of whom might have been affected by the criticisms and schemes of those who opposed them, as mentioned in earlier verses.\r\n\r\nBy emphasizing Allah's ultimate control and the believers' dependence on Him, the verse encourages <strong>trust and reliance on Allah</strong> in the face of adversity. It follows the previous verse by providing further justification for Allah's ability to change or replace revelations – as the sovereign of all, He has the ultimate authority. The subsequent verse will then address a specific behavior of some who questioned the Prophet.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ"},{"verse":"108","text":"Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.","commentary":"This verse seems to be addressing <strong>some members of the early Muslim community who were questioning the Prophet Muhammad in a manner similar to how the Israelites had questioned the Prophet Moses</strong>. The text implies that such excessive questioning and demands for signs or proofs, after having already embraced the faith, could indicate a wavering of belief.\r\n\r\nThe verse warns against <strong>\"bartering faith for unbelief,\"</strong> stating that such a person has <strong>strayed from the correct path</strong>. This likely refers to those who, influenced by doubts raised by opponents of Islam, might be tempted to abandon their faith. It connects to the previous verse by highlighting the need for unwavering faith in Allah, the ultimate protector. The following verse will then elaborate on the desires of some \"people of earlier revelations\" to lead the believers astray.","arabic":"أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَسْأَلُوا رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۗ وَمَنْ يَتَبَدَّلِ الْكُفْرَ بِالْإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ"},{"verse":"109","text":"Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse reveals the <strong>desire of many among the \"people of earlier revelations\" (primarily Jews and Christians)</strong> to see the Muslims revert to their former state of unbelief after they had embraced Islam. The underlying motive for this desire is identified as <strong>\"deep-seated envy,\"</strong> even after the truth of Islam had become clear to them. This refers back to the sentiments mentioned in verse 105.\r\n\r\nDespite this opposition, the verse advises the believers to <strong>\"forgive and forbear\"</strong> until Allah issues His command. This emphasizes patience and tolerance in dealing with hostility, trusting in Allah's ultimate judgment and power. It follows the previous verse by explaining one of the reasons why some might be tempted to question the Prophet – the influence of those who wished to lead them away from their faith. The next verse will then encourage the believers to focus on their own acts of worship.","arabic":"وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ ۖ فَاعْفُوا وَاصْفَحُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"110","text":"And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing.","commentary":"This verse instructs the believers to <strong>remain steadfast in their worship</strong> by <strong>attending regularly to prayer</strong> and <strong>paying zakat (a form of obligatory charitable giving)</strong>. It emphasizes that <strong>any good deeds done by individuals will be rewarded by Allah</strong>. The verse concludes by reminding them that <strong>Allah is aware of all their actions</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse serves as a <strong>consolation and a directive</strong> for the believers who were facing opposition and attempts to mislead them, as mentioned in the previous verses. It encourages them to focus on their personal relationship with Allah through prayer and good deeds, assuring them that their efforts will not be in vain. It follows the call for forgiveness and forbearance by suggesting a positive course of action for the believers. The following verses will then address specific claims made by Jews and Christians.","arabic":"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"111","text":"And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking, Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a <strong>claim made by both Jews and Christians</strong> that <strong>only those who belong to their respective faiths will enter Paradise</strong>. The verse dismisses these assertions as <strong>\"wishful fancies\"</strong> and challenges them to <strong>\"produce your proof, if what you say is true\"</strong>. This highlights the lack of any concrete evidence for such exclusive claims.\r\n\r\nThis verse shifts the focus to the <strong>doctrinal disagreements</strong> between the early Muslims and the \"people of earlier revelations.\" It directly refutes their claims of exclusivity regarding salvation. It follows the previous verse by presenting a specific example of the baseless arguments being put forth by those who opposed the Muslim community. The next verse will then offer a contrasting principle for attaining reward from Allah.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ"},{"verse":"112","text":"Yes [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>universal principle for attaining reward from Allah</strong>. It states that <strong>whoever sincerely submits themselves to Allah</strong> and <strong>accompanies this submission with righteous actions (doing good works)</strong> will receive their reward from their Lord. Such individuals will have <strong>no reason to fear in the future nor to grieve over the past</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse directly counters the exclusive claims made in the previous verse by establishing that <strong>submission to Allah and good deeds are the criteria for divine reward</strong>, regardless of one's religious label or heritage. It emphasizes the importance of both inner faith (\"surrender themselves to Allah\") and outward actions (\"doing good works\"). The following verse will then describe the contradictory views held by Jews and Christians despite their shared scriptures.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"113","text":"The Jews say \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus the polytheists speak the same as their words. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.","commentary":"This verse highlights the <strong>contradictory and critical views that Jews and Christians held towards each other's faiths</strong>. It notes that <strong>Jews claimed Christians had no basis for their faith, and vice versa</strong>, despite the fact that <strong>both groups recited scriptures</strong> (referring to their respective holy books). The verse then adds that <strong>\"those devoid of knowledge\"</strong> (likely referring to the polytheistic Arabs who were also critical of both Judaism and Christianity) made similar pronouncements.\r\n\r\nThe verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah will judge between them all regarding their disputes on the Day of Judgement</strong>. This emphasizes that the ultimate resolution of these religious disagreements lies with Allah. This verse follows the previous one by further illustrating the divisions and conflicting claims within the religious landscape of that time, setting the stage for Allah's final judgment.","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ ۚ فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"114","text":"And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.","commentary":"This verse speaks about the <strong>extreme injustice</strong> of those who prevent the mention of Allah's name in places dedicated to worship and who attempt to destroy these places. It suggests that such individuals, if they were to enter these sacred spaces, should do so with a sense of fear due to their actions. The verse also indicates consequences for such behavior, including <strong>disgrace in this life and severe suffering in the hereafter</strong>. This verse follows the discussion about the differing claims of religious groups and their criticisms of each other, highlighting a severe form of religious intolerance. It then connects to the subsequent verse by shifting to the universal ownership of the east and the west by Allah, suggesting that no particular group has exclusive rights over sacred spaces or the direction of worship.","arabic":"وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ مَنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ أَنْ يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ وَسَعَىٰ فِي خَرَابِهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَنْ يَدْخُلُوهَا إِلَّا خَائِفِينَ ۚ لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ"},{"verse":"115","text":"And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes the <strong>universality of Allah</strong> and that <strong>all directions belong to Him</strong>. It implies that the act of worship is not confined to a specific geographical direction because Allah is present everywhere. The verse concludes by affirming Allah's <strong>boundless generosity and complete knowledge</strong>. This verse directly addresses the context of the direction of prayer (Qiblah) which was a point of contention, suggesting that focusing on a particular direction is a matter of practice, not a limitation of Allah's presence. It connects to the previous verse by providing a broader understanding of worship and sacred spaces, and it sets the stage for the following verses which address distorted concepts about Allah.","arabic":"وَلِلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ ۚ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّوا فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"116","text":"They say, \"Allah has taken a son.\" Exalted is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him,","commentary":"This verse addresses the claim by some that <strong>Allah has a son</strong>, a concept it vehemently rejects by declaring <strong>Allah's absolute perfection and transcendence</strong>. It asserts that <strong>everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah</strong> and that <strong>all creation is obedient to Him</strong>. This verse shifts the focus from the specifics of worship and religious conflict to fundamental theological beliefs about the nature of Allah. It connects to the previous verse by further elaborating on Allah's power and dominion over all things and leads into the next verse by describing Allah as the Originator of creation.","arabic":"وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا ۗ سُبْحَانَهُ ۖ بَلْ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ كُلٌّ لَهُ قَانِتُونَ"},{"verse":"117","text":"Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.","commentary":"This verse describes Allah as the <strong>sole Creator of the heavens and the earth</strong>. It emphasizes His <strong>absolute power and will</strong>, stating that when He intends for something to exist, He simply commands it to \"Be,\" and it comes into existence. This reinforces the theological points made in the previous verse about Allah's uniqueness and power. It connects to the preceding verse by explaining how Allah's will brings about creation without any need for partners or offspring, and it sets the context for the following verse which discusses the demands of those who lack understanding.","arabic":"بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ"},{"verse":"118","text":"Those who do not know say, \"Why does Allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].","commentary":"This verse notes that those who <strong>lack true understanding</strong> often demand direct communication from Allah or specific signs as proof. It points out that such demands are not new and were made by people in the past, suggesting a <strong>similarity in their lack of conviction</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>clear signs have already been provided for those who have firm faith</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding description of Allah's creative power by highlighting that despite such clear signs, some remain unconvinced and seek more. It leads into the next verse by focusing on the role of the Prophet who has been sent with the truth and clear guidance.","arabic":"وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلَا يُكَلِّمُنَا اللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَا آيَةٌ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ ۘ تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۗ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ"},{"verse":"119","text":"Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.","commentary":"This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad directly, affirming that he has been sent with <strong>the truth</strong> and with the dual role of bringing <strong>good news</strong> to those who believe and <strong>warning</strong> those who reject the truth. It also reassures the Prophet that he will <strong>not be held responsible for the fate of those who choose to disbelieve</strong>. This verse shifts the focus back to the Prophet's mission after the discussion of theological concepts and the demands of the disbelievers. It connects to the previous verse by indicating that the clear signs mentioned are part of the truth brought by the Prophet. It leads to the next verse by describing the reactions of the Jews and Christians to the Prophet's message.","arabic":"إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِالْحَقِّ بَشِيرًا وَنَذِيرًا ۖ وَلَا تُسْأَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِ الْجَحِيمِ"},{"verse":"120","text":"And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance.\" If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper.","commentary":"This verse highlights the <strong>fundamental difference</strong> between the message of the Prophet and the beliefs of some Jews and Christians of that time, stating that they would only be satisfied if he were to adopt their faith. It firmly declares that <strong>Allah's guidance is the only true guidance</strong>. The verse also warns the Prophet (and by extension, his followers) that if they were to abandon the truth they have received and follow the desires of others, they would find no protector or helper against Allah. This verse builds upon the description of the Prophet's mission in the previous verse, focusing on the specific opposition he faced from certain religious communities. It connects to the following verse by distinguishing between those among the People of the Book who truly understand their scriptures and those who deny the truth.","arabic":"وَلَنْ تَرْضَىٰ عَنْكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ ۗ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ بَعْدَ الَّذِي جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ ۙ مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ"},{"verse":"121","text":"Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it - it is they who are the losers.","commentary":"This verse refers to those among the people who had previously received divine scriptures (\"the Book\") and who <strong>understand and follow them correctly</strong>, stating that they <strong>truly believe</strong> in the message brought by the Prophet. In contrast, those who <strong>reject this truth are described as being at a great loss</strong>. This verse provides a nuanced view of the People of the Book, following the previous verse's discussion of their opposition. It suggests that genuine understanding of prior scriptures would lead to acceptance of the new message. It connects to the final verses by shifting to a direct address to the Children of Israel, reminding them of Allah's favor and warning them of the Day of Judgment.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ الْكِتَابَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِ أُولَٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ"},{"verse":"122","text":"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.","commentary":"This verse is a direct address to the <strong>Children of Israel</strong>, reminding them of the <strong>favors bestowed upon them</strong> in the past and that they were <strong>once distinguished among all people</strong>. This marks a shift in the passage, moving from general principles and the Prophet's interactions to a specific historical and religious community. It connects to the preceding verses by providing historical context related to the People of the Book and sets the stage for the warning in the next verse about accountability for one's actions.","arabic":"يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"123","text":"And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.","commentary":"This concluding verse serves as a <strong>solemn warning</strong> to the Children of Israel (and by extension, all people) about the <strong>Day of Judgment</strong>. It emphasizes that on this day, <strong>no one will be able to help another</strong>, no <strong>ransom</strong> will be accepted as a substitute for one's deeds, no <strong>intercession</strong> will be effective (except as willed by Allah), and <strong>no one will receive aid</strong> other than through Allah's mercy. This verse directly follows the reminder of past favors to the Children of Israel, urging them to take heed of the consequences of their actions. It concludes the passage by emphasizing individual accountability and the ultimate authority of Allah in matters of judgment.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا تَنْفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ"},{"verse":"124","text":"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them.

Abraham then inquired about his descendants, wishing for them also to be leaders. Allah responded by saying, <strong>‘My covenant does not apply to the wrongdoers.’</strong> This indicates that while Abraham's lineage is significant, the divine promise of leadership and guidance is contingent upon individuals being righteous and just, not simply on their ancestry. This verse follows the previous section which discussed the Children of Israel and their history, introducing Abraham as a figure of great importance and a point of reference for true faith.

It mentions the instruction to <strong>‘Make the place where Abraham stood as a place of prayer.’</strong> This emphasizes the historical connection to Abraham. Furthermore, <strong>Abraham and his son Ishmael were given the responsibility of purifying this House</strong> for those who would come to it for various forms of worship, including circumambulation (walking around it), meditation, bowing, and prostration in prayer. This verse builds upon the introduction of Abraham in the previous verse, detailing his role in establishing a significant place of worship.

This verse serves as a transition, reflecting on the significance of Abraham's faith after his prayers were mentioned. It connects to the following verse by describing Abraham's complete submission to Allah.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَرْغَبُ عَنْ مِلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلَّا مَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ ۚ وَلَقَدِ اصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ"},{"verse":"131","text":"When his Lord said to him, \"Submit\", he said \"I have submitted [in Islam] to the Lord of the worlds.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a direct command from <strong>Allah to Abraham: ‘Submit yourself.’</strong> Abraham's immediate response was, <strong>‘I have submitted myself to the Lord of all the worlds.’</strong> This demonstrates Abraham's complete and willing <strong>submission to Allah</strong>, which is the essence of the term \"Islam\" in its general sense – surrendering to the will of the Divine. This verse elaborates on the nature of Abraham's faith mentioned in the previous verse, highlighting his total devotion. It leads into the next verse by stating that Abraham and Jacob (also known as Israel) both enjoined this same submission upon their children.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ ۖ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"132","text":"And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did] Jacob, [saying], \"O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.\"","commentary":"This verse states that <strong>Abraham instructed his children to adhere to this faith of submission</strong>, and similarly, <strong>Jacob (also known as Israel) also enjoined the same upon his children</strong>, saying, <strong>‘My children, Allah has given you the purest faith.

It highlights the idea of a continuous lineage of faith and the importance of remaining in a state of submission to Allah until the end of one's life. This verse follows the description of Abraham's submission in the previous verse, showing that he and his grandson Jacob emphasized the same principle to their descendants. It connects to the next verse by presenting a specific instance of Jacob on his deathbed inquiring about his children's faith.","arabic":"وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَا بَنِيَّ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ الدِّينَ فَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"133","text":"Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after me?\" They said, \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God.

This verse follows the statement about some people knowingly concealing the truth, reinforcing the authenticity of the message. It leads into the next verse, which discusses that each community has a direction they face and encourages striving in good deeds.","arabic":"الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۖ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"148","text":"For each [religious following] is a direction toward which it faces.

It states that those who are killed in this cause should not be considered dead. Instead, they are described as being alive, although this is beyond human perception.

Their dedication to upholding what they believed to be the universal truth gives lasting impact to their lives. This verse follows the encouragement to seek strength and patience, highlighting the ultimate sacrifice some might make. It leads into the next verses that discuss the various trials that believers will face.","arabic":"وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَنْ يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ ۚ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"155","text":"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the <strong>tests and trials</strong> that believers will experience.

This acknowledgment is seen as the essence of true submission and trust in Allah's plan. Verses 155-156 connect to the previous verse by describing the potential consequences of dedicating oneself to Allah's cause, while emphasizing the appropriate response to such challenges. They prepare for the following verse, which describes the rewards for those who remain patient.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُمْ مُصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"157","text":"Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy.

It specifically addresses the ritual of walking between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, located near the Ka'bah (the Sacred House). This practice was part of pre-Islamic traditions and might have caused confusion after the establishment of Islamic practices. The verse clarifies that performing this walk during pilgrimage or `Umrah (a lesser pilgrimage) is a permissible act and <strong>does not constitute wrongdoing</strong>. Furthermore, the verse broadens its scope by stating that <strong>Allah appreciates and acknowledges any good done voluntarily</strong>.

The commentary suggests this verse refers particularly to those among earlier recipients of divine messages (like Jews and Christians) who knowingly concealed truths about the new message (Islam). Their motive is described as evading the truth or altering it for their own purposes or worldly gains. The consequence of this concealment is that they will be <strong>rejected and denounced</strong> by Allah and by others. This verse follows the clarification about the ritual of Safa and Marwah, now addressing the responsibility of those who possess knowledge of divine guidance and the severe consequences of deliberately suppressing it. It leads to the subsequent verse, which offers an exception for those who repent.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَا أَنْزَلْنَا مِنَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالْهُدَىٰ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّاهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِي الْكِتَابِ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ يَلْعَنُهُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ اللَّاعِنُونَ"},{"verse":"160","text":"Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed].

It states that <strong>if such individuals repent, correct their behavior, and openly declare the truth they had previously hidden, Allah will accept their repentance</strong> because He is the ultimate acceptor of repentance and the Merciful. This verse offers a contrast to the stern warning in the preceding verse, highlighting Allah's mercy and the opportunity for those who have erred to return to the right path. It sets the stage for the following verses, which describe the fate of those who reject faith and die in that state.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا وَأَصْلَحُوا وَبَيَّنُوا فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَأَنَا التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"161","text":"Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of Allah and of the angels and the people, all together,","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>consequences for those who reject faith (unbelief) and die in that state</strong>. They will be under the <strong>curse of Allah, the angels, and all of humanity</strong>. This reinforces the seriousness of rejecting the revealed guidance after it has been made clear. This verse follows the verse about the acceptance of repentance, contrasting the fate of those who turn back to truth with those who persist in disbelief until death. It leads directly to the next verse, which elaborates on the nature of this curse.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"162","text":"Abiding eternally therein.

It then leads to the next verse, which introduces the fundamental concept of the oneness of Allah.","arabic":"خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ لَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْظَرُونَ"},{"verse":"163","text":"And your god is one God.

This is presented as a fundamental truth that should guide all of humanity. This verse marks a shift in focus from the condemnation of those who reject truth to a positive affirmation of the central belief in one God. It sets the foundation for the following verse, which points to the natural world as evidence of Allah's oneness and power.","arabic":"وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ"},{"verse":"164","text":"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what Allah has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>evidence for the oneness and power of Allah by pointing to various aspects of creation</strong>. It lists phenomena such as the creation of the universe, the cycle of day and night, the usefulness of sea travel, the life-giving rain, the diversity of living creatures, the movement of winds, and the clouds. All these are presented as <strong>signs for those who use their intellect and reasoning</strong>. This verse follows the declaration of Allah's oneness, offering tangible examples from the natural world that serve as indicators of His existence and sovereignty. It prepares for the subsequent verses, which contrast those who recognize these signs with those who associate others with Allah.","arabic":"إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنْفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِنْ مَاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"165","text":"And [yet], among the people are those who take other than Allah as equals [to Him].

The verse also speaks of a future realization for the unbelievers, when they experience suffering and understand that all power belongs solely to Allah and that His retribution is severe. This verse follows the description of the signs of Allah's oneness in creation, now focusing on the human response to these signs, differentiating between believers and those who deviate.

It uses strong imagery, stating that they <strong>consume fire within themselves</strong>. Furthermore, it warns that Allah will not address them on the Day of Judgment nor purify them from their sins, and that they will face severe suffering. This verse follows the explanation of permissible and forbidden foods and links back to the earlier theme of concealing the truth (verses 159-160). It sets the stage for the next verse by describing the consequence of their actions as an exchange of guidance for error.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلَّا النَّارَ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"175","text":"Those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they are in pursuit of the Fire!","commentary":"This verse further describes the <strong>foolish exchange made by those who suppress divine guidance</strong>. They are depicted as having <strong>traded guidance for error and forgiveness for suffering</strong>. The verse ends with a rhetorical question highlighting their apparent willingness to endure the severe punishment (\"the Fire\"). This verse directly follows the description of the punishment for concealing scripture, emphasizing the nature of their misguided choice. It leads into the next verse by explaining the reason behind their dire situation.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ وَالْعَذَابَ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ"},{"verse":"176","text":"That is [deserved by them] because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book are in extreme dissension.","commentary":"This verse provides the <strong>reason for the severe consequences</strong> described in the previous verses. It states that Allah has revealed the Scripture <strong>with the truth</strong>, and therefore, <strong>those who contradict or deviate from it are profoundly mistaken</strong>. This verse follows the description of the consequences of concealing truth and clarifies that the basis for judgment is the revealed scripture itself. It sets the context for the final verse of this passage, which presents a comprehensive definition of righteousness.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ نَزَّلَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ ۗ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِي الْكِتَابِ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ"},{"verse":"177","text":"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.","commentary":"This verse offers a <strong>comprehensive definition of true righteousness</strong>. It clarifies that it is not merely about outward rituals or facing a particular direction. Instead, it encompasses <strong>sincere belief</strong> in Allah, the Day of Judgment, the angels, the Scriptures, and the Prophets. It also involves <strong>charitable actions</strong>, such as giving to relatives, orphans, the poor, travelers in need, beggars, and for the freeing of slaves. Furthermore, it includes the <strong>observance of prayer, the giving of obligatory charity (zakat), keeping promises, and being patient in difficult times</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that those who embody these qualities are <strong>truthful and God-fearing</strong>. This verse concludes the passage by moving from specific issues like food laws and the condemnation of concealing truth to a broader and more holistic understanding of faith and righteous conduct, emphasizing inner belief and its manifestation in actions.","arabic":"لَيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَنْ تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى الْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ وَالسَّائِلِينَ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَى الزَّكَاةَ وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُوا ۖ وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِي الْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"178","text":"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.","commentary":"This verse addresses believers and introduces the concept of <strong>just retribution</strong> in cases of killing. It outlines a principle of equality in retribution based on social status: a free person for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. However, it also introduces an alternative: if the victim's family chooses to forgive the killer or accept <strong>financial compensation</strong> (blood money) instead of execution, this is permissible. In such cases, the pursuit of compensation should be done with fairness, and the payment should be made in a good way. This provision is described as a <strong>mercy and a concession</strong> from Allah. The verse concludes by warning that anyone who violates this agreement after it has been made will face severe consequences. This verse sets the initial legal framework for dealing with homicide within the community. It is followed by a verse that explains the wisdom behind this law.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنْثَىٰ بِالْأُنْثَىٰ ۚ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"179","text":"And there is for you in legal retribution [saving of] life, O you [people] of understanding, that you may become righteous.","commentary":"This verse immediately follows the one on just retribution and explains its <strong>purpose and wisdom</strong>. It states that there is \"<strong>life</strong>\" in this law for those who understand it. The commentary clarifies that the goal of this legislation is not merely vengeance but the <strong>preservation of life</strong> by deterring future killings. When people know that taking a life will result in the loss of their own, they are more likely to refrain from such an act. Furthermore, by allowing for financial compensation, it can help to prevent cycles of revenge and promote reconciliation between families or groups. The verse ends by linking this law to becoming \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>,\" suggesting that understanding and adhering to such just laws fosters a sense of accountability and moral consciousness. This verse emphasizes the positive outcomes and the underlying ethical principles of the law introduced in the previous verse.","arabic":"وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"180","text":"Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.","commentary":"This verse shifts from the topic of retribution to that of <strong>making bequests (wills)</strong>. It states that when death is near and a person is leaving behind property, it is a duty for the \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>\" to make bequests in a fair manner to parents and other close relatives. Before specific inheritance laws were revealed later in the Quran (mentioned in Surah 4), this verse highlighted the importance of providing for one's family and near relatives through a will. The term \"<strong>property</strong>\" can also be interpreted broadly to mean wealth in general. This verse emphasizes the ethical responsibility of individuals to ensure a just distribution of their wealth after their passing, particularly towards family members. It is followed by verses that address the alteration and potential errors in wills.","arabic":"كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ إِنْ تَرَكَ خَيْرًا الْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"181","text":"Then whoever alters the bequest after he has heard it - the sin is only upon those who have altered it. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","commentary":"This verse immediately follows the instruction to make fair bequests and addresses the <strong>integrity of wills</strong>. It warns against tampering with or altering a will after it has been made known. The verse clearly states that the <strong>responsibility and the wrongdoing (sin)</strong> for such an action lie solely with the person who makes the alteration, not the deceased who made the will. The verse concludes by emphasizing that <strong>Allah hears and knows all</strong>, underscoring His awareness of such actions and the accountability that will follow. This verse serves to protect the wishes of the deceased and ensure that their intended bequests are honored, reinforcing the importance of honesty and trustworthiness in such matters. It is connected to the previous verse by providing a safeguard for the instructions given regarding wills.","arabic":"فَمَنْ بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَمَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَا إِثْمُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"182","text":"But if one fears from the bequeather [some] error or sin and corrects that which is between them, there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","commentary":"This verse provides an <strong>exception</strong> to the rule against altering wills mentioned in the previous verse. It states that if an executor or someone aware of the will fears that the person who made it has made a <strong>mistake or an unfair decision</strong> that could harm some of the beneficiaries or heirs, then bringing about a <strong>settlement and reconciliation</strong> between the concerned parties is permissible and carries no wrongdoing. This provision acknowledges the possibility of unintentional errors or biases in a will and allows for a just resolution through mutual agreement. The verse ends by describing <strong>Allah as much-Forgiving and Merciful</strong>, highlighting His compassion and understanding in such situations. This verse builds upon the previous one by allowing for rectification in cases of perceived injustice in a will, promoting fairness and harmony among the inheritors. It leads into a new topic: the religious obligation of fasting.","arabic":"فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا أَوْ إِثْمًا فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"183","text":"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous -","commentary":"This verse marks a transition to a new topic: the <strong>religious obligation of fasting</strong>. It addresses believers directly and informs them that fasting has been prescribed for them, just as it was for <strong>previous communities</strong>. The primary <strong>purpose</strong> of fasting is stated as achieving \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>\" (taqwa), which signifies a state of awareness, obedience, and consciousness of Allah. Fasting is presented as a means of spiritual discipline and self-control, helping individuals to become more mindful of their relationship with Allah and to guard against wrongdoing. This verse introduces the general obligation of fasting and its underlying spiritual aim, setting the stage for the more detailed rules and concessions that follow.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"184","text":"[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]. And whoever volunteers excess - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.","commentary":"This verse elaborates on the obligation of fasting introduced in the previous verse. It clarifies that fasting is for \"<strong>a certain number of days</strong>\". It provides <strong>exemptions</strong> for those who are <strong>ill or on a journey</strong>, allowing them to <strong>make up</strong> for the missed days later. Additionally, it mentions that those who find fasting an <strong>excessive burden</strong> (some interpretations include the elderly or those with chronic illnesses) have the option to <strong>compensate</strong> by feeding a needy person for each day of fasting missed. The verse also encourages <strong>voluntary good deeds</strong>, stating that those who do good of their own accord benefit themselves. It concludes by emphasizing the <strong>benefits of fasting</strong>, even if they are not immediately apparent, suggesting that it is ultimately for one's own good. This verse provides practical guidelines and concessions related to the general obligation of fasting mentioned in the preceding verse, leading to a more specific definition of the fasting period in the following verse.","arabic":"أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۚ فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۚ وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ ۖ فَمَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهُ ۚ وَأَنْ تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"185","text":"The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion.

Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.","commentary":"This verse specifies the <strong>month of Ramadan</strong> as the time when fasting is obligatory for those who are present and healthy. It highlights the significance of Ramadan as the month in which the <strong>Quran was revealed</strong>, describing the Quran as a <strong>guidance for humanity</strong>, a clear proof of that guidance, and a standard for discerning right from wrong. The verse reiterates the <strong>exemption</strong> for those who are <strong>ill or on a journey</strong>, requiring them to fast an equal number of days later. It emphasizes that <strong>Allah desires ease</strong> for people and does not want to impose hardship on them. The verse also stresses the importance of <strong>completing the missed days</strong> and to \"<strong>extol and glorify Allah</strong>\" for His guidance and to be <strong>thankful</strong> to Him. This verse builds upon the previous one by specifying the timing of the fast and further emphasizing the principles of ease and gratitude in this religious practice. It is followed by a verse that speaks to the closeness of Allah to His servants.","arabic":"شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِنَ الْهُدَىٰ وَالْفُرْقَانِ ۚ فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَنْ كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۗ يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"186","text":"And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.","commentary":"This verse, placed amidst the verses about fasting, offers a profound insight into the <strong>closeness of Allah to His servants</strong>. It states that when Allah's servants ask about Him, the response is that <strong>He is near</strong> and that <strong>He answers the prayer of the one who calls upon Him</strong>. The verse then calls upon believers to <strong>respond to Allah</strong> and to <strong>believe in Him</strong> so that they may be guided to the <strong>right way</strong>. This verse emphasizes the direct and personal relationship between individuals and Allah, offering solace and reassurance, especially during times of devotion like fasting when prayers are often more focused. It connects to the surrounding verses by providing spiritual encouragement and highlighting the accessibility of Allah to those who are engaged in acts of worship like fasting. This leads into the resumption of the specific rules of fasting.","arabic":"وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ ۖ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا بِي لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ"},{"verse":"187","text":"It has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which Allah has decreed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the sunset. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His ordinances to the people that they may become righteous.","commentary":"This verse details further regulations regarding fasting, specifically concerning <strong>intimacy with spouses and the timing of the fast</strong>. It makes it <strong>lawful for married couples to be intimate</strong> during the nights preceding the fast. The verse uses a metaphor, stating that spouses \"<strong>are as a garment for you, as you are for them</strong>,\" signifying closeness, mutual support, and protection. It mentions that Allah is aware that some believers were struggling with the previous restrictions regarding relations after sleeping at night and that He has pardoned them out of His mercy. The verse then permits intimacy during the night and specifies the time for eating and drinking: <strong>until the first light of dawn</strong> is visible. The fast then lasts <strong>until nightfall</strong>. Finally, it prohibits intimacy with spouses during periods of <strong>religious retreat (i'tikaf) in mosques</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that these are the <strong>limits set by Allah</strong>, and people should not come near violating them. Allah makes His revelations clear so that people may remain \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>\". This verse provides specific and practical guidelines for observing the fast, building upon the general obligation and exemptions mentioned earlier. It leads to a verse that addresses financial integrity within the community.","arabic":"أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَائِكُمْ ۚ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَهُنَّ ۗ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنْتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ ۖ فَالْآنَ بَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَابْتَغُوا مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۚ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الْأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الْأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَقْرَبُوهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ"},{"verse":"188","text":"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].","commentary":"This final verse of the passage shifts to the topic of <strong>financial dealings and integrity</strong> within the community, following the detailed rules about fasting. It commands believers <strong>not to consume each other's property unjustly</strong>. This includes various forms of dishonest acquisition. The verse specifically warns against <strong>bribing judges</strong> to obtain favorable rulings that would allow one to unlawfully take what belongs to others. It emphasizes that such actions are sinful and done knowingly. The commentary connects this to the overall theme of being \"<strong>God-fearing</strong>,\" as maintaining financial honesty and justice is a fundamental aspect of religious and ethical conduct. This verse broadens the scope from personal religious observance (fasting) to social ethics and the importance of fairness and integrity in interactions within the community. It concludes this section of instructions, linking back to the overarching theme of living in accordance with Allah's commands and maintaining a sense of moral responsibility.","arabic":"وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتُدْلُوا بِهَا إِلَى الْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُوا فَرِيقًا مِنْ أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ بِالْإِثْمِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"189","text":"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the new moons.

And fear Allah that you may succeed.","commentary":"This verse addresses a question about the <strong>new moons</strong>, explaining that they serve as <strong>natural markers for timekeeping</strong>, including the timing of the <strong>pilgrimage</strong>. It then shifts to correct a pre-Islamic Arab custom of entering houses from the back, considering it not a matter of true righteousness. Instead, the verse states that <strong>real righteousness lies in being mindful and respectful of Allah</strong>. It instructs people to <strong>enter houses by their doors</strong> and to <strong>be conscious of Allah</strong> in their actions, as this leads to success.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>connects to the broader theme</strong> of the passage, which is the introduction and clarification of religious obligations and proper conduct for the Muslim community. It follows the preceding discussion in the surah (though not in this specific chunk) and sets the stage for the subsequent verses by emphasizing that <strong>outward rituals are less important than inner consciousness and obedience to Allah</strong>.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ ۗ وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"},{"verse":"190","text":"Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.","commentary":"This verse provides the <strong>first directive regarding fighting</strong>. It permits Muslims to <strong>fight those who initiate war against them</strong> but explicitly <strong>prohibits aggression</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah does not favor those who commit aggression</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>directly follows</strong> the previous one by transitioning from matters of timekeeping and customs to the topic of warfare. It <strong>introduces the concept of justified fighting</strong> while setting a clear <strong>ethical boundary against initiating hostility</strong>, thus establishing a fundamental principle for the Muslim community's interactions with others. This will be further elaborated in the verses that follow.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ"},{"verse":"191","text":"And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing.

It emphasizes that <strong>oppression is considered a greater evil than killing</strong>, providing a justification for defensive action. However, it places a <strong>restriction on fighting near the Sacred Mosque in Makkah</strong>, allowing it only if the enemy initiates hostilities there. The verse concludes by stating that such is the consequence for those who reject faith and wage war.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>builds upon the previous one</strong> by giving more specific instructions on <strong>how to respond to aggression</strong>. It clarifies the circumstances under which fighting is permissible, even in a sacred area, while still emphasizing the <strong>prohibition of initiating conflict</strong>. This sets the stage for the following verse, which discusses the cessation of fighting.","arabic":"وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ ۚ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِنْدَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ ۖ فَإِنْ قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"192","text":"And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","commentary":"This verse offers a condition for stopping the fighting. It states that <strong>if the aggressors cease their hostilities</strong>, then Muslims should also stop, and they should recognize that <strong>Allah is forgiving and merciful</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>directly follows</strong> the preceding instructions on engaging the enemy. It introduces the <strong>principle of reconciliation and forgiveness</strong> once the aggression ends. This provides a <strong>contrast to the previous verse's directive to fight</strong> and leads into the subsequent verse, which further clarifies the purpose of continued fighting if oppression persists.","arabic":"فَإِنِ انْتَهَوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"193","text":"Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah.

It reiterates that <strong>if the aggressors cease their oppression</strong>, then <strong>hostilities should end</strong>, except for dealing with those who continue to do wrong.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>continues the discussion on warfare</strong> from the previous two verses. It explains the <strong>underlying purpose of engaging in conflict</strong> – to establish freedom from persecution and the right to believe without fear. It connects to the following verse by providing a broader principle that informs the specific context of fighting during sacred months.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انْتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"194","text":"[Fighting in] the sacred month is for [aggression committed in] the sacred month, and for [all] violations is legal retribution.

It establishes the principle of <strong>reciprocity and just retribution</strong> even concerning the sanctity of these months. If someone violates the sanctity of a sacred month by committing aggression, they can be responded to in kind. The verse concludes by urging believers to <strong>be mindful of Allah</strong> and assuring them that <strong>Allah is with those who are conscious of Him</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>builds upon the general principles of fighting</strong> laid out in the preceding verses by addressing a specific context – the <strong>sacred months</strong>. It <strong>connects to the following verse</strong> by transitioning to the topic of spending resources for the cause of Allah, which is closely linked to the idea of striving and facing challenges.","arabic":"الشَّهْرُ الْحَرَامُ بِالشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْحُرُمَاتُ قِصَاصٌ ۚ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُوا عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"195","text":"And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.","commentary":"This verse encourages believers to <strong>spend their wealth for the cause of Allah</strong> and warns them <strong>not to be negligent in this duty</strong>, as that could lead to their downfall. It also urges them to <strong>persist in doing good</strong>, emphasizing that <strong>Allah loves those who act with excellence</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>follows the discussion on warfare and just response</strong> by introducing another important aspect of supporting the cause of Allah: <strong>financial contribution</strong>. It <strong>connects to the subsequent verses</strong> by shifting the focus to the rituals of pilgrimage, another significant religious obligation that requires effort and resources. The encouragement to do good (ihsan) is a recurring theme that ties together various aspects of Islamic practice.","arabic":"وَأَنْفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ ۛ وَأَحْسِنُوا ۛ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"196","text":"And complete the Hajj and 'umrah for Allah.

And when you are secure, then whoever performs 'umrah [during the Hajj months] followed by Hajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during Hajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram. And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in penalty.","commentary":"This verse introduces the <strong>obligations of the pilgrimage (Hajj) and the voluntary lesser pilgrimage (`Umrah`)</strong>. It emphasizes that these acts should be <strong>performed completely and sincerely for the sake of Allah</strong>. It provides <strong>contingencies for those who are prevented from completing them</strong>, requiring an offering. It also addresses the timing of shaving the head, linking it to the offering, and offers <strong>alternatives for those who are ill or have head ailments</strong>. For those who combine `Umrah` with the pilgrimage (if able and safe), an offering is required, with an alternative of fasting for those who cannot afford it. Finally, it clarifies that these rules regarding combining `Umrah` and pilgrimage do not apply to residents near the Sacred Mosque and concludes with a reminder to <strong>be mindful of Allah</strong> and His severe retribution.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>follows the encouragement to spend for Allah's cause</strong> by introducing another major religious obligation: the <strong>pilgrimage</strong>. It <strong>sets the stage for the subsequent verses</strong> by detailing various rules and aspects of the pilgrimage rituals. The emphasis on performing these acts purely for Allah’s sake and the concluding reminder of fearing Allah tie this verse back to the central themes of righteousness and God-consciousness discussed earlier in the passage.","arabic":"وَأَتِمُّوا الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ ۖ وَلَا تَحْلِقُوا رُءُوسَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ ۚ فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ مَرِيضًا أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِنْ رَأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِنْ صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ ۚ فَإِذَا أَمِنْتُمْ فَمَنْ تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ ۚ فَمَنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ ۗ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"197","text":"Hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made Hajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of ihram], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during Hajj.

And fear Me, O you of understanding.","commentary":"This verse specifies that the <strong>pilgrimage must be undertaken during certain appointed months</strong>. It outlines important <strong>conduct for pilgrims</strong>, including abstaining from indecent behavior, wrongdoing, and disputes. It reassures believers that <strong>Allah is aware of all the good they do</strong>. The verse also emphasizes the need for <strong>preparation for the pilgrimage</strong>, both materially and spiritually, stating that <strong>the best preparation is being conscious of Allah</strong>. It concludes with a direct call to those with understanding to <strong>be mindful of Allah</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>continues the discussion on the pilgrimage</strong> introduced in the previous verse by specifying the <strong>timeframe for its performance</strong> and highlighting the <strong>required ethical and spiritual state of the pilgrims</strong>.

It then moves to a specific ritual, instructing pilgrims to <strong>remember Allah at a place called al-Mashar al-Haram (in Muzdalifah) after departing from Arafat</strong>, which is a key part of the pilgrimage. The verse also reminds them to <strong>remember Allah's guidance</strong>, highlighting that before this guidance, they were in error.\r\n\r\nThis verse <strong>follows the previous one</strong> by addressing a practical concern of pilgrims – whether engaging in trade during the pilgrimage is acceptable. It then transitions to describing specific <strong>rituals of the pilgrimage</strong>, building upon the general introduction in verse 196 and the behavioral guidelines in verse 197. It <strong>connects to the subsequent verse</strong> by continuing the description of the pilgrimage rituals, particularly the movement from Muzdalifah. The reminder of Allah's guidance reinforces the overall theme of divine favor and the importance of following it.","arabic":"لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَنْ تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۚ فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُمْ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِنْدَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ ۖ وَاذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَاكُمْ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الضَّالِّينَ"},{"verse":"199","text":"Then depart from the place from where [all] the people depart and ask forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","commentary":"This verse continues the description of the pilgrimage rituals. Following the important gathering at Arafat (mentioned in the previous verse's commentary, even though the verse itself is not included in this selection), pilgrims then move towards another location called Muzdalifah. The instruction here is to <strong>proceed from the same point as the rest of the pilgrims</strong>, promoting a sense of unity and equality among them. It also emphasizes the importance of <strong>seeking forgiveness from Allah</strong>. The verse concludes by highlighting Allah's attributes of being <strong>Forgiving and Merciful</strong>, offering reassurance to those who seek His pardon. This verse follows the guidance about remembering Allah after departing Arafat and directly precedes instructions on remembering Allah upon the completion of sacred duties.","arabic":"ثُمَّ أَفِيضُوا مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ النَّاسُ وَاسْتَغْفِرُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"200","text":"And when you have completed your rites, remember Allah like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world,\" and he will have in the Hereafter no share.","commentary":"This verse addresses the period <strong>after the completion of the main pilgrimage rituals</strong>. It instructs the pilgrims to <strong>remember Allah with a remembrance that is even more profound</strong> than how they remember their ancestors. This highlights a shift in focus towards a deeper spiritual connection. The verse then contrasts two types of people in their prayers: those who solely seek worldly benefits and those who seek both worldly and spiritual good. It notes that those who only ask for worldly gains will have no share in the rewards of the afterlife. This verse connects the completion of the rituals from the previous section with the themes of reflection and the nature of prayer that continue in the subsequent verses.","arabic":"فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمْ مَنَاسِكَكُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ آبَاءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا ۗ فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ"},{"verse":"201","text":"But among them is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\"","commentary":"This verse presents the <strong>second type of prayer</strong>, offered by those who seek a more balanced life. They ask Allah for <strong>what is good in this world as well as what is good in the life to come</strong>, and also seek protection from suffering. This demonstrates a holistic view, recognizing the importance of both present life and the afterlife. This verse follows the contrast established in the previous verse and leads into the description of the rewards for those who offer such comprehensive prayers.","arabic":"وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"202","text":"Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account.","commentary":"This verse states that those who offer the balanced prayer, seeking good in both this world and the next (as mentioned in the preceding verse), <strong>will receive their due reward</strong> for their efforts. It emphasizes that <strong>Allah's reckoning is swift</strong>, assuring them that their good intentions and prayers will not go unnoticed. This verse serves as a direct consequence of the prayer described in Verse 201 and sets the stage for the final instructions regarding the duration of stay during the pilgrimage and the importance of fearing Allah.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا ۚ وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"203","text":"And remember Allah during [specific] numbered days. Then whoever hastens [his departure] in two days - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears Allah. And fear Allah and know that unto Him you will be gathered.","commentary":"This verse provides instructions regarding the <strong>duration of the pilgrimage stay</strong>. It mentions <strong>\"certain appointed days\"</strong> during which pilgrims should glorify Allah. It then gives a concession: pilgrims who choose to leave after two days are not at fault, and neither are those who decide to stay longer. However, this concession is <strong>conditional on being truly God-fearing</strong>. The verse concludes with a powerful reminder to <strong>fear Allah and to be aware that all people will ultimately be gathered before Him</strong>. This final reminder connects back to the central theme of the passage, emphasizing the importance of piety and accountability, and brings the series of instructions related to the pilgrimage to a close. It follows the description of rewards in the previous verse by highlighting the importance of maintaining a conscious awareness of Allah even as the pilgrimage concludes.","arabic":"وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ فِي أَيَّامٍ مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۚ فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ ۚ لِمَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ"},{"verse":"204","text":"And of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the fiercest of opponents.","commentary":"This verse introduces <strong>a type of person who uses eloquent speech to create a favorable impression</strong> in this life. They might even invoke Allah as a witness to their sincerity. However, their outward charm <strong>conceals a deeply antagonistic nature</strong>. This verse sets up a contrast with the following verse, which describes the actions that reveal this hidden hostility.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ الْخِصَامِ"},{"verse":"205","text":"And when he goes away, he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals. And Allah does not like corruption.","commentary":"Building on the description in the previous verse, this verse explains the <strong>actions of the outwardly pleasing but hostile individual</strong>. Once they are out of sight, they actively work to <strong>cause disorder and ruin in the world</strong>, symbolized by the destruction of agriculture and offspring (representing the foundations of a thriving society). The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah does not approve of such corruption</strong>, highlighting the negative consequences of these actions. This verse further develops the character introduced in Verse 204 and contrasts with the positive traits described later in the passage.","arabic":"وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ"},{"verse":"206","text":"And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah,\" pride in the sin takes hold of him. Sufficient for him is Hellfire, and how wretched is the resting place.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the negative character. When such a person is advised to <strong>be mindful of Allah and His accountability</strong>, their <strong>arrogance and inflated sense of self</strong> prevent them from heeding the warning, leading them further into wrongdoing. The verse then mentions the consequence of such behavior: <strong>hell will be their final destination</strong>, described as a dreadful place to end up. This verse concludes the description of this negative personality type, contrasting it with the sincere believer introduced in the following verse.","arabic":"وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالْإِثْمِ ۚ فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ"},{"verse":"207","text":"And of the people is he who sells himself, seeking means to the approval of Allah. And Allah is kind to [His] servants.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>stark contrast to the individual described in the preceding verses</strong>. Here, we encounter <strong>a person who is willing to sacrifice their own interests and well-being in order to seek the approval of Allah</strong>. This demonstrates deep sincerity and devotion. The verse ends by emphasizing <strong>Allah's immense compassion for those who sincerely serve Him</strong>. This verse marks a clear shift in the passage, moving from negative examples to positive ones.","arabic":"وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"208","text":"O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.","commentary":"Addressing those who believe, this verse calls for <strong>complete and wholehearted submission to Allah</strong> in all aspects of life. It also warns against <strong>following the ways of Satan</strong>, who is identified as a clear and declared enemy. This verse acts as a bridge, transitioning from the contrasting examples of individuals to a direct instruction for the believers on how to live. It sets the stage for the consequences of deviating from this path, as mentioned in the subsequent verse.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ"},{"verse":"209","text":"But if you deviate after clear proofs have come to you, then know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>warning to those who have embraced belief</strong>. It states that if they were to <strong>deviate from the right path after clear guidance and evidence of the truth have been provided</strong>, they should be aware that <strong>Allah is All-Powerful and possesses ultimate wisdom</strong>. This implies that there will be consequences for knowingly turning away from the truth. This verse follows the call for submission in the previous verse by highlighting the importance of remaining steadfast. It leads into the subsequent verses, which question the delay in accepting Allah's guidance.","arabic":"فَإِنْ زَلَلْتُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْكُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ فَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"210","text":"Do they await but that Allah should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels [as well] and the matter is [then] decided? And to Allah [all] matters are returned.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who might be <strong>hesitant or delaying their acceptance of Allah's message</strong>. It rhetorically asks if they are waiting for a dramatic and undeniable revelation of Allah's presence, accompanied by angels. The verse then states that <strong>at that point, the matter will be decided, and all things will ultimately return to Allah</strong>. This suggests that waiting for such a definitive sign might be too late, and emphasizes the ultimate accountability to Allah. This verse follows the warning in the previous verse by questioning the reasons for delaying belief. It then transitions to reflecting on the experiences of previous communities.","arabic":"هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ"},{"verse":"211","text":"Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. And whoever exchanges the favor of Allah [for disbelief] after it has come to him - then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","commentary":"This verse directs attention to the <strong>history of the Children of Israel</strong>, asking about the numerous clear signs they were given. It then states a general principle: <strong>whoever changes or denies the blessings and guidance of Allah after they have been received should know that Allah's punishment is severe</strong>. This serves as a historical lesson and a cautionary note to the current audience, urging them not to repeat the mistakes of the past. This verse follows the previous one by shifting focus to a specific historical community and the consequences of their actions, leading into a discussion of the allure of worldly life for those who disbelieve.","arabic":"سَلْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ كَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ مِنْ آيَةٍ بَيِّنَةٍ ۗ وَمَنْ يُبَدِّلْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"212","text":"Beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world, and they ridicule those who believe. But those who fear Allah are above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah gives provision to whom He wills without account.","commentary":"This verse explains that the <strong>temporary pleasures and attractions of this world can be deceptive and alluring to those who do not believe</strong>. This can lead them to <strong>mock and ridicule those who hold religious beliefs</strong>. However, the verse assures that <strong>those who are mindful of Allah will be of a higher status on the Day of Judgment</strong>. It concludes by stating that <strong>Allah provides for whomever He wills without limitation</strong>, emphasizing His ultimate control and generosity. This verse follows the reflection on the Children of Israel by contrasting the perspectives and ultimate fates of believers and disbelievers. It sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on the unity and subsequent differences among humankind.","arabic":"زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا وَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۘ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ"},{"verse":"213","text":"Mankind was [of] one religion [before their deviation]; then Allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed.

And Allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed, by His permission. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.","commentary":"This verse discusses the <strong>early history of humanity</strong>, stating that humankind was initially a single community. <strong>Allah then sent prophets as messengers</strong>, bringing both good news and warnings. With these prophets, <strong>Allah revealed divine scriptures (the Book) containing the truth</strong>, intended to resolve any disputes among people. The verse notes that it was specifically those who had already received the scriptures who, out of envy and injustice, began to dispute them after clear evidence had been provided. However, <strong>Allah, through His grace, guided the believers to the truth they had differed upon</strong>. The verse concludes by affirming that <strong>Allah guides whomever He wills to the correct path</strong>. This verse follows the contrast between believers and disbelievers by providing a broader historical context for the emergence of different beliefs. It leads into the final verse of this selection, which discusses the challenges faced by believers.","arabic":"كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ النَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ وَأَنْزَلَ مَعَهُمُ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِيمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ ۚ وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ فَهَدَى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ"},{"verse":"214","text":"Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you?

It describes how previous communities of faith were tested with <strong>affliction and adversity</strong>, to the extent that even the prophets and their followers questioned when Allah's help would arrive. The verse ends with a reassuring statement: <strong>\"Surely, Allah’s help is close at hand,\"</strong> emphasizing that divine support will eventually come to those who persevere. This verse concludes this passage by reminding believers that trials are a natural part of faith and that patience and perseverance will be rewarded.","arabic":"أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَنْ تَدْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُمْ مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْا مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ ۖ مَسَّتْهُمُ الْبَأْسَاءُ وَالضَّرَّاءُ وَزُلْزِلُوا حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ نَصْرَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ"},{"verse":"215","text":"They ask you, [O Muhammad], what they should spend.

And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally.","commentary":"This verse addresses a <strong>specific question about the permissibility of fighting during the sacred months</strong>, a time traditionally observed as a period of peace. The response clarifies that <strong>while fighting during these months is considered a serious offense</strong>, other actions, such as <strong>preventing people from following Allah's path, disbelief, violating the sanctity of the Sacred Mosque, and expelling its people, are even more serious in Allah's view</strong>. The verse also states that <strong>religious persecution is worse than killing</strong>. It highlights the persistence of those who oppose the faith in their attempts to make believers abandon their beliefs and warns about the consequences for those who renounce their faith and die as disbelievers. This verse follows the general statement about fighting by addressing a specific context, leading into a discussion about other matters of concern to the community, such as intoxicants and gambling.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ ۖ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ ۖ وَصَدٌّ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ ۗ وَلَا يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَنْ دِينِكُمْ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعُوا ۚ وَمَنْ يَرْتَدِدْ مِنْكُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُولَٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"218","text":"Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of Allah - those expect the mercy of Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","commentary":"This verse speaks about <strong>those who have embraced belief, left their homes for the sake of their faith, and put in sincere effort for Allah's cause</strong>. It states that these individuals are <strong>the ones who can truly expect Allah's mercy and forgiveness</strong>. The verse concludes by emphasizing that <strong>Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful</strong>. This verse can be seen as a reassurance following the strong warnings in the previous verse. It highlights the reward and hope for those who actively strive for their faith, even in the face of difficulty, and precedes the discussion on intoxicants and games of chance.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا وَجَاهَدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أُولَٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ اللَّهِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"219","text":"They ask you about wine and gambling.

Say, \"The excess [beyond needs].\" Thus Allah makes clear to you the verses [of revelation] that you might give thought.","commentary":"This verse addresses <strong>questions about intoxicants (like alcohol) and games of chance (gambling)</strong>. It states that <strong>while there might be some perceived benefits in them for people, the harm they cause is far greater</strong>. The verse then revisits the topic of charity, when asked what should be spent, the answer is <strong>\"whatever you can spare\"</strong>, indicating that giving should come from what is beyond one's basic needs. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah makes His teachings clear so that people may contemplate both their present life and their future</strong>. This verse follows the encouragement for those who strive in their faith by addressing other practical aspects of life that require guidance. It leads into a discussion about the treatment of orphans.","arabic":"يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ ۖ قُلْ فِيهِمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَإِثْمُهُمَا أَكْبَرُ مِنْ نَفْعِهِمَا ۗ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ قُلِ الْعَفْوَ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"220","text":"To this world and the Hereafter.

And if Allah had willed, He could have put you in difficulty. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse's mention of reflecting on this life and the afterlife, this verse specifically addresses a <strong>question about the treatment of orphans</strong>. It states that <strong>acting in the best interest of orphans is the most appropriate course of action</strong>. If their affairs are managed together with one's own, it is important to remember that <strong>orphans are considered brothers (in humanity or faith)</strong>. The verse emphasizes that <strong>Allah is aware of those who act with harmful intentions and those who strive to improve things</strong>. It concludes by stating that <strong>if Allah had willed, He could have imposed greater burdens</strong>, but He is <strong>All-Powerful and Wise</strong> in His guidance. This verse concludes this passage by focusing on social responsibility and the care for vulnerable members of the community, following the discussions on financial contributions and other aspects of life.","arabic":"فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۗ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَامَىٰ ۖ قُلْ إِصْلَاحٌ لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ ۖ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ الْمُصْلِحِ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَأَعْنَتَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"221","text":"And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe.

And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they may remember.","commentary":"This verse addresses the topic of marriage. It states that believers, both men and women, should not marry individuals who associate partners with Allah unless they embrace the belief in One God. The verse highlights that <strong>faith is a primary consideration in marriage</strong>, suggesting that a believing person, even if they are a slave (which was a social reality at the time), is better than someone who does not share the same core beliefs, even if the latter might seem more appealing in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning provided is that those who do not believe in One God invite others to a path that leads away from divine favor, metaphorically described as \"the Fire\". In contrast, Allah invites people to \"Paradise\" and \"forgiveness\". The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah makes His teachings clear so that people may reflect on them. This verse sets a principle emphasizing the importance of shared fundamental beliefs in establishing a marital relationship and connects to the subsequent discussion on purity in marital relations.","arabic":"وَلَا تَنْكِحُوا الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ ۚ وَلَأَمَةٌ مُؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ مُشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ ۗ وَلَا تُنْكِحُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُوا ۚ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ مُشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَالْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ ۖ وَيُبَيِّنُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"222","text":"And they ask you about menstruation.

And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you. Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\"","commentary":"This verse addresses a question about menstruation, a natural biological process. It describes menstruation as a state of \"discomfort\". During this time, the verse advises men to <strong>abstain from sexual intercourse with their wives</strong>. This abstinence should continue until the women have completed their period and have purified themselves (likely referring to ritual cleansing after menstruation).\r\n\r\nOnce this purification has occurred, the verse permits resuming marital relations in the manner ordained by Allah, which commentary suggests refers to engaging in intercourse in a way that allows for procreation. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah loves those who frequently seek forgiveness and those who strive for purity</strong>. This links the physical aspect of marital life with broader spiritual principles of repentance and purification, moving the discussion from the restrictions during menstruation to the resumption of relations within a framework of seeking Allah's pleasure.","arabic":"وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْمَحِيضِ ۖ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَاعْتَزِلُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ ۖ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ التَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ"},{"verse":"223","text":"Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers.","commentary":"This verse uses an analogy, comparing wives to a \"place of cultivation\". This metaphor highlights the role of marital relations in procreation and the continuation of human life. The verse states that men may approach their wives in this \"place of cultivation\" in the manner they desire, within the bounds of decency and propriety.\r\n\r\nHowever, the verse also includes a moral and spiritual dimension by urging believers to <strong>\"put forth [righteousness] for yourselves\"</strong>. This suggests that even within the intimacy of marriage, there should be an awareness of higher spiritual goals and intentions. The verse then reinforces the importance of <strong>fearing Allah and being mindful that everyone will ultimately meet Him</strong>. It concludes by instructing the Prophet to <strong>\"give good tidings to the believers\"</strong>. This verse connects the intimate aspects of marriage with the broader themes of righteousness, accountability to Allah, and the positive outcomes for those who believe, leading into the subsequent discussion on oaths and their significance in marital relationships.","arabic":"نِسَاؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَكُمْ فَأْتُوا حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ ۖ وَقَدِّمُوا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ مُلَاقُوهُ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"224","text":"And do not make [your oath by] Allah an excuse against being righteous and fearing Allah and making peace among people. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","commentary":"This verse addresses the issue of using oaths made in Allah's name as a reason to avoid doing good, being mindful of Allah, or reconciling differences between people. It emphasizes that <strong>oaths should not become obstacles to virtuous actions</strong>. For example, if someone swears not to speak to a relative due to a disagreement, this verse suggests that such an oath should not prevent them from making peace if an opportunity arises.\r\n\r\nThe verse underscores the importance of <strong>prioritizing good deeds, piety, and reconciliation</strong> over rigid adherence to oaths that hinder these values. It concludes by reminding believers that <strong>Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing</strong>, implying that He is aware of their intentions and the impact of their oaths and actions. This verse serves as a general ethical guideline regarding the proper use and understanding of oaths, which can also be relevant in the context of marital vows or other commitments. It leads to the following verses that specifically address oaths made regarding abstinence from one's wife.","arabic":"وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا اللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لِأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَنْ تَبَرُّوا وَتَتَّقُوا وَتُصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"225","text":"Allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the accountability related to oaths. It states that <strong>Allah will not hold people responsible for unintentional or casual remarks made in oaths</strong>. However, <strong>accountability rests on the intentions and deliberate commitments made in the heart</strong>. This distinction suggests that thoughtless or accidental slips of the tongue in the form of oaths are not the same as consciously made vows.\r\n\r\nThe verse concludes with the attributes of Allah: <strong>All-Forgiving and Forbearing</strong>, indicating His mercy and patience towards human shortcomings and unintentional errors. This verse provides a nuance to the previous discussion on oaths, differentiating between unintentional and deliberate oaths, and sets the stage for the following verses that discuss the consequences of deliberately vowing to abstain from marital relations.","arabic":"لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ اللَّهُ بِاللَّغْوِ فِي أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ يُؤَاخِذُكُمْ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"226","text":"For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months, but if they return [to normal relations] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific type of oath where a husband swears to abstain from sexual relations with his wife. It establishes a <strong>waiting period of four months</strong> for such a vow. This timeframe provides an opportunity for reflection and reconciliation.\r\n\r\nIf, within these four months, the husband decides to <strong>resume normal relations with his wife</strong>, the verse states that <strong>Allah is Forgiving and Merciful</strong>, implying that the consequences of the oath can be reversed through reconciliation. This verse introduces a specific legal ruling regarding marital vows of abstinence, outlining a defined period for resolution and highlighting the possibility of forgiveness if the couple reconciles, leading to the next verse which discusses the alternative if reconciliation does not occur.","arabic":"لِلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِنْ نِسَائِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ ۖ فَإِنْ فَاءُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"227","text":"And if they decide on divorce - then indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","commentary":"This verse follows the previous one regarding vows of abstinence from marital relations. It addresses the situation where, after the four-month waiting period, the husband <strong>resolves to proceed with a divorce</strong> rather than return to normal relations.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the verse states that <strong>Allah is Hearing and Knowing</strong>, signifying that He is aware of the couple's decision and the reasons behind it. This does not necessarily imply immediate divine intervention but rather acknowledges Allah's complete knowledge of the situation and the intentions of both parties. This verse presents divorce as the consequence if reconciliation does not happen after a vow of abstinence, leading to the subsequent verses that discuss the waiting period for divorced women.","arabic":"وَإِنْ عَزَمُوا الطَّلَاقَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"228","text":"Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day.

But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","commentary":"This verse outlines the waiting period ('iddah') for divorced women who menstruate. They are required to <strong>wait for three menstrual cycles</strong> before they can remarry. The verse emphasizes that if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, it is <strong>not permissible for them to conceal if they are pregnant</strong> (what \"Allah has created in their wombs\"). This is to ensure clarity of lineage.\r\n\r\nDuring this waiting period, <strong>husbands have a greater right to take their wives back if their intention is reconciliation</strong>. The verse also establishes a principle of <strong>equality in rights and obligations between spouses \"according to what is just,\"</strong> while also mentioning that <strong>\"men have a degree [of advantage] over them\"</strong>. Commentaries often interpret this \"degree\" in terms of responsibilities like financial support. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is Mighty and Wise</strong>, highlighting the divine authority and wisdom behind these regulations. This verse sets the rules for divorced women's waiting period and the possibility of reconciliation, leading to the following verses that discuss the process and finality of divorce.","arabic":"وَالْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَاثَةَ قُرُوءٍ ۚ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَنْ يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِي أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِنْ كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوا إِصْلَاحًا ۚ وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"229","text":"Divorce is twice.

But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the process of divorce. It states that <strong>divorce can be pronounced only twice</strong>. After the first or second pronouncement, the husband must either <strong>\"keep [them] in an acceptable manner\"</strong> (i.e., reconcile and continue the marriage with kindness) or <strong>\"release [them] with good treatment\"</strong> (i.e., finalize the divorce amicably).\r\n\r\nThe verse also addresses the issue of the dowry (mahr) given by the husband. It is stated that <strong>it is not lawful for husbands to take back any part of the dowry</strong> unless there is a genuine fear that the couple will not be able to live together harmoniously within the bounds of Allah's laws. In such cases, if the wife offers to return a portion of the dowry to secure the divorce (khul'), there is no blame on either party. The verse concludes by emphasizing that <strong>these are the limits set by Allah, which should not be transgressed</strong>, and those who do are considered \"the wrongdoers\". This verse regulates the number of revocable divorces and the conditions under which financial settlements related to divorce are permissible, leading to the next verse which discusses the consequences of a third divorce pronouncement.","arabic":"الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَنْ يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"230","text":"And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him.

These are the limits of Allah, which He makes clear to a people who know.","commentary":"This verse addresses the consequence of a third and final divorce pronouncement. It states that if a husband divorces his wife for the third time, <strong>she is no longer lawful for him to remarry</strong> until she has married another man and that marriage has been dissolved (through death or divorce). This provision acts as a deterrent against impulsive or repeated divorces.\r\n\r\nIf the second husband then divorces her, <strong>there is no blame upon the first husband and the woman to remarry each other</strong> if they both believe they can now live together within the guidelines set by Allah. The verse concludes by reiterating that <strong>these are the limits of Allah, which He makes clear for people who understand</strong>. This verse establishes the finality of a third divorce and the conditions under which a previously thrice-divorced couple can remarry, leading to the subsequent verses that discuss the proper treatment of divorced women and the waiting period.","arabic":"فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِنْ بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ ۗ فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَنْ يَتَرَاجَعَا إِنْ ظَنَّا أَنْ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"231","text":"And when you divorce women and they have [nearly] fulfilled their term, either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms, and do not keep them, intending harm, to transgress [against them].

It instructs husbands to <strong>either retain their wives with fairness</strong> (i.e., reconcile and continue the marriage justly) <strong>or release them with fairness</strong> (i.e., finalize the divorce kindly without causing harm or distress).\r\n\r\nThe verse explicitly forbids retaining women <strong>\"to harm them so that you transgress [Allah's limits]\"</strong>. It warns that <strong>\"whoever does that has wronged himself\"</strong>. Furthermore, it urges believers <strong>\"do not take the verses of Allah in jest,\"</strong> emphasizing the seriousness of these divine guidelines. The verse reminds them of <strong>\"the favor of Allah upon you and what has been revealed to you of the Book and wisdom by which He instructs you\"</strong>. It concludes with the exhortation to <strong>\"fear Allah and know that Allah is Knowing of all things,\"</strong> reinforcing the importance of being mindful of Allah's commands and awareness in all dealings, especially during and after divorce. This verse emphasizes the need for just and kind treatment of divorced women and the serious nature of Allah's laws, setting the stage for further rules related to divorce and related matters.","arabic":"وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ سَرِّحُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ ۚ وَلَا تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لِتَعْتَدُوا ۚ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ ۚ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا آيَاتِ اللَّهِ هُزُوًا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَا أَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"232","text":"And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis.

It instructs the community and family members <strong>not to obstruct</strong> such a remarriage if both individuals agree to it fairly and justly. This guidance is presented as a reminder for those who believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment, emphasizing the ethical and spiritual dimensions of such decisions. Preventing a consensual remarriage under these circumstances is discouraged, as allowing it is considered <strong>more virtuous and purer</strong> for all involved. The verse concludes by highlighting that <strong>Allah has complete knowledge</strong>, whereas human understanding is limited, implying that following this guidance aligns with a greater wisdom. This verse follows the detailed procedures of divorce outlined previously, now focusing on the possibility of reconciliation and remarriage under fair conditions. The subsequent verse shifts to the rights and responsibilities concerning children after divorce.","arabic":"وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنْكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ إِذَا تَرَاضَوْا بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۗ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"233","text":"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period].

The verse emphasizes that <strong>no one should be burdened beyond their capacity</strong>, ensuring fairness to both parents. It prohibits causing harm or unfair treatment to either parent because of the child. If both parents mutually agree to wean the child before the two-year period, there is no blame on them. The verse also allows for the option of employing a wet nurse, provided that the agreed-upon compensation is paid fairly. The verse concludes with a reminder to <strong>fear Allah</strong> and be mindful that <strong>Allah sees all actions</strong>, underscoring the moral and divine oversight in these family matters. This verse follows the rules of remarriage by focusing on the well-being of children in divorce scenarios. The next verses will address the situation of widows.","arabic":"وَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ ۖ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ ۚ وَعَلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَا تُضَارَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَهُ بِوَلَدِهِ ۚ وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَٰلِكَ ۗ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا ۗ وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمْ أَنْ تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُمْ مَا آتَيْتُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"234","text":"And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And Allah is [fully] Acquainted with what you do.","commentary":"This verse introduces the <strong>waiting period for women whose husbands have passed away</strong>. It states that a widow must observe a period of four months and ten days before she can remarry. Once this waiting period is over, there is <strong>no blame on the community or family</strong> for the decisions the widow makes regarding her future, as long as they are lawful. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is fully aware of all actions</strong>, implying accountability and divine knowledge of these matters. This verse shifts the focus from divorced women and children to the situation of widows. The subsequent verse will address how marriage proposals can be made to widows during their waiting period.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنْكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا ۖ فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنْفُسِهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"235","text":"There is no blame upon you for that to which you [indirectly] allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves.

And do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end. And know that Allah knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>guidance on how marriage proposals can be communicated to widowed women</strong> during their waiting period. It clarifies that there is <strong>no blame</strong> on men if they subtly hint at a marriage proposal or keep such intentions private. The verse acknowledges that men will naturally have such thoughts. However, it prohibits making <strong>secret marriage agreements</strong> during this period, allowing only for \"words of appropriate kindness\" – respectful and decent conversation. The verse also emphasizes <strong>not finalizing the marriage contract</strong> until the waiting period has fully concluded. It ends with a powerful reminder that <strong>Allah knows what is in people's hearts</strong>, urging them to <strong>fear Him</strong> and highlighting that <strong>Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing</strong>, suggesting leniency for unintentional thoughts but accountability for actions. This verse builds upon the previous one by addressing the social interactions involving widows during their prescribed waiting time. The following verses will discuss situations of divorce before the marriage has been consummated.","arabic":"وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ النِّسَاءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنْتُمْ فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرًّا إِلَّا أَنْ تَقُولُوا قَوْلًا مَعْرُوفًا ۚ وَلَا تَعْزِمُوا عُقْدَةَ النِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ الْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"236","text":"There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation. But give them [a gift of] compensation - the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability - a provision according to what is acceptable, a duty upon the doers of good.","commentary":"This verse addresses the situation of <strong>divorce before the marriage has been consummated</strong> (before the couple has had sexual relations) or before a specific bridal gift (dowry) has been formally agreed upon. It states that in such cases, there is <strong>no blame</strong> on the husband for initiating the divorce. However, the verse recommends providing the divorced woman with a <strong>fair compensation</strong> or gift. The amount of this provision should be determined by the husband's financial capacity – the wealthy should give according to their means, and the poor according to theirs. This provision is described as \"a duty upon the doers of good,\" highlighting it as an act of kindness and ethical behavior. This verse follows the guidance on widows by shifting to another aspect of marital dissolution: divorce before consummation. The next verse continues this theme by discussing the situation where a bridal gift has been specified.","arabic":"لَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُوا لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً ۚ وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعًا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ"},{"verse":"237","text":"And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation, then [give] half of what you specified - unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion of divorce before consummation, but it specifically addresses cases where a <strong>bridal gift (dowry) has already been agreed upon</strong>. In this scenario, the divorced woman is entitled to <strong>half of the specified bridal gift</strong>, unless she chooses to forgo her right to it, or the male guardian who has the authority over the marriage contract chooses to forgo the husband's obligation to pay it. The verse emphasizes that <strong>forgoing one's right is closer to righteousness</strong>, promoting generosity and goodwill. It also includes a general reminder <strong>not to forget graciousness</strong> in dealings with one another, even in the difficult situation of divorce. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is seeing of all that people do</strong>, underscoring the importance of ethical conduct and divine awareness. This verse directly follows the previous one, providing further details on the financial implications of divorce before consummation. The subsequent verses will shift to the topic of prayer, subtly linking worship with these family regulations.","arabic":"وَإِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلَّا أَنْ يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ النِّكَاحِ ۚ وَأَنْ تَعْفُوا أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ ۚ وَلَا تَنْسَوُا الْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"238","text":"Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle prayer and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient.","commentary":"This verse introduces a <strong>shift in focus to the importance of prayer</strong> within the broader context of family and social regulations. It emphasizes the need to <strong>maintain all obligatory prayers with care and attention</strong>, singling out \"the middle prayer\" for particular mention (though its specific identity is a subject of interpretation). The verse instructs believers to <strong>stand before Allah</strong> during prayer in a state of <strong>devout obedience</strong>. This verse, seemingly interrupting the discussion on family matters, subtly highlights that obedience to Allah in all aspects of life, including marriage and divorce, is an act of worship akin to prayer itself. It connects the practicalities of life with spiritual devotion. The next verse continues the discussion on prayer, specifically addressing how it should be performed in times of fear.","arabic":"حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ"},{"verse":"239","text":"And if you fear [an enemy, then pray] on foot or riding. But when you are secure, then remember Allah [in prayer], as He has taught you that which you did not [previously] know.","commentary":"This verse continues the discussion on prayer, specifically addressing how to perform it in <strong>situations of fear or danger</strong>, such as during conflict. It permits praying <strong>while walking or riding</strong> if one fears an enemy, acknowledging the practical needs in such circumstances. However, the verse stresses that <strong>when safety is restored</strong>, believers should <strong>remember Allah in prayer</strong> in the regular manner, as He has taught them what they did not previously know. This highlights that while concessions are made during times of hardship, the fundamental obligation of prayer remains, and it should be performed properly when conditions allow. This verse follows the general instruction to maintain prayers by providing specific guidance for challenging situations. The subsequent verse marks a return to the theme of provisions for widows.","arabic":"فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالًا أَوْ رُكْبَانًا ۖ فَإِذَا أَمِنْتُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُمْ مَا لَمْ تَكُونُوا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"240","text":"And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - for their wives is a bequest: maintenance for one year without turning [them] out. But if they leave [of their own accord], then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","commentary":"This verse returns to the topic of <strong>widows and their waiting period</strong>, presenting a directive related to their accommodation. It suggests that the deceased should make a will providing for their wives to reside in their dwelling for <strong>one year</strong> without being evicted. However, if the widow chooses to <strong>leave the dwelling of her own accord</strong> before the year is up, then there is <strong>no blame</strong> on the community or family for what she does with herself in a lawful manner. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise</strong>, emphasizing His power and the wisdom behind these regulations. This verse follows the discussion on prayer by returning to the theme of widows' rights and obligations after their husband's death. The next verse will address the provision that should be made for divorced women.","arabic":"وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنْكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لِأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ ۚ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنْفُسِهِنَّ مِنْ مَعْرُوفٍ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"241","text":"And for divorced women is a provision according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.","commentary":"This verse addresses the <strong>rights of divorced women</strong>, stating that they are entitled to a <strong>provision (financial support)</strong> that is fair and reasonable according to social norms. This is described as <strong>an obligation upon the righteous</strong> or those who are God-fearing, highlighting the ethical and moral imperative of providing for a divorced woman. The amount and nature of this provision are not specified, leaving it to be determined by what is considered just and acceptable within the community and the individual circumstances. This verse follows the guidance on widows by addressing the financial rights of divorced women. The concluding verse of this section will summarize the purpose of these divine clarifications.","arabic":"وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"242","text":"Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you might use reason.","commentary":"This concluding verse of the section on family laws and related matters serves as a <strong>summary statement</strong>, emphasizing the purpose of the preceding verses. It declares that <strong>Allah makes His verses clear</strong> to humankind <strong>so that they may understand</strong>. This highlights that the detailed regulations concerning marriage, divorce, the care of children, and the rights of widows and divorcees are revealed with the intention of providing guidance and promoting comprehension within the community. It underscores the importance of reflecting upon these divine instructions to foster a just and harmonious society. This verse concludes the detailed discussion on family matters, linking them back to the overarching divine guidance for human life.","arabic":"كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"243","text":"Have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them, \"Die\"; then He restored them to life. And Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of the people do not show gratitude.","commentary":"This verse begins by presenting a historical example of a large group of people who abandoned their homes, driven by a fear of death. It states that <strong>Allah caused them to die, and subsequently restored them to life</strong>, highlighting that life and death are under Allah's control. The purpose of this example is to convey that efforts to avoid death when it is destined are futile. Ultimately, life is a gift from Allah, bestowed without any action or merit on the part of individuals, and humans cannot prevent what Allah has already willed. The verse concludes by affirming Allah’s abundant grace towards humanity, while noting that many people fail to appreciate this. This sets the stage for the following verses, which encourage believers to act in the cause of Allah without being unduly influenced by the fear of death, as both life and death are in His hands.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ اللَّهُ مُوتُوا ثُمَّ أَحْيَاهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ"},{"verse":"244","text":"And fight in the cause of Allah and know that Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","commentary":"Following the example in the previous verse about the inevitability of Allah's decree regarding life and death, this verse directly encourages believers to <strong>engage in striving (fighting) for the cause of Allah</strong>. It reassures them that <strong>Allah is all-hearing and all-knowing</strong>, implying that He is aware of their efforts, their intentions, and their sacrifices. This verse builds upon the theme of the previous verse by suggesting that fear of death should not deter one from pursuing what is right in the sight of Allah, as He is fully aware of their actions and will reward them accordingly. It also introduces the concept of striving for Allah's cause, which is further elaborated in the subsequent verse.","arabic":"وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"245","text":"Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned.","commentary":"Continuing the theme of striving in the cause of Allah introduced in the previous verse, this verse encourages <strong>financial contribution as a form of sacrifice</strong>. It poses a rhetorical question asking who will offer Allah a \"generous loan,\" promising that He will repay it manifold. This is presented as an act of devotion. The verse then clarifies that <strong>Allah controls both hardship and abundance in people's lives</strong>. It concludes with the reminder that <strong>everyone will ultimately return to Allah</strong>, emphasizing the temporary nature of worldly possessions and the ultimate accountability to Him. This verse connects to the preceding call to action by highlighting that striving for Allah's cause can involve both physical effort and financial sacrifice, with the assurance of divine reward and the understanding that Allah is the ultimate provider.","arabic":"مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"246","text":"Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs, \"Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah \"? He said, \"Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you?\" They said, \"And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?\" But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse shifts to another historical example, this time concerning the Children of Israel after the time of Moses. It recounts how their elders asked one of their prophets to <strong>appoint a king so they could fight for the cause of Allah</strong>, expressing their strong motivation due to being driven from their homes and separated from their children. The prophet initially questioned their sincerity, wondering if they would actually fight if commanded to do so. Despite their initial enthusiasm and reasons for wanting to fight, <strong>when the time for battle came, most of them retreated</strong>, except for a small number. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is fully aware of those who do wrong</strong>. This narrative serves as a lesson, highlighting the potential discrepancy between stated intentions and actual commitment, and the importance of true resolve when facing challenges in the cause of Allah. It connects to the previous verses by providing a historical illustration of the need for genuine commitment when called to action.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الْمَلَإِ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ إِذْ قَالُوا لِنَبِيٍّ لَهُمُ ابْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكًا نُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۖ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ أَلَّا تُقَاتِلُوا ۖ قَالُوا وَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَائِنَا ۖ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"247","text":"And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king.\" They said, \"How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?\" He said, \"Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing.\"","commentary":"Continuing the story of the Children of Israel, this verse describes the <strong>prophet's announcement that Allah had chosen Saul (Talut) as their king</strong>. However, the elders <strong>questioned this appointment</strong>, arguing that they were more deserving of leadership due to lineage and wealth, as Saul was not from a noble background and was not wealthy. The prophet responded by clarifying that <strong>Allah had chosen Saul based on His knowledge and had endowed him with both knowledge and physical strength</strong>, qualities essential for leadership. He emphasized that <strong>Allah bestows His authority upon whomever He wills, and He is bountiful and all-knowing</strong>. This verse follows the previous one by detailing the initial response of the Israelites to the appointment of a leader for their cause, revealing their tendency to question divine decisions based on their own criteria.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا ۚ قَالُوا أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِنَ الْمَالِ ۚ قَالَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يُؤْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"248","text":"And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron had left, carried by the angels. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.\"","commentary":"To further convince the Israelites of Saul's divinely appointed kingship, their prophet provided a <strong>clear sign: the return of a sacred casket</strong>. This casket was described as containing <strong>peace and reassurance from Allah</strong>, and <strong>relics left by the families of Moses and Aaron</strong>. The verse states that this casket would be <strong>brought by angels</strong>, serving as undeniable proof for those who truly believed. This verse builds upon the previous one by describing a miraculous sign intended to overcome the Israelites' objections to Saul's leadership and to provide them with reassurance and faith in his appointment.","arabic":"وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ التَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ آلُ مُوسَىٰ وَآلُ هَارُونَ تَحْمِلُهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"249","text":"And when Saul went forth with the soldiers, he said, \"Indeed, Allah will be testing you with a river.

Then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, they said, \"There is no power for us today against Goliath and his soldiers.\" But those who were certain that they would meet Allah said, \"How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah. And Allah is with the patient.\"","commentary":"This verse narrates how Saul, having set out with his troops, <strong>tested their obedience and discipline at a river</strong>. He instructed them not to drink from it, except for a single scoop with their hand, stating that those who drank more would not be considered part of his fighting force. <strong>Most of the soldiers disobeyed and drank their fill</strong>, while only a few adhered to the command. Subsequently, when Saul and the faithful few crossed the river and faced the formidable army of Goliath, some of them were <strong>overwhelmed by the enemy's size and expressed their lack of strength</strong>. However, a small group of <strong>true believers, certain of meeting their Lord, declared that victory is not dependent on numbers</strong>, as Allah's grace can enable a small force to triumph over a large one, and that <strong>Allah is with those who are patient in adversity</strong>. This verse connects to the previous ones by illustrating the challenges of leadership and the need for unwavering faith and obedience in the face of trials. It highlights the winnowing process that separates the truly committed from those who are weak in their resolve.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِالْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُمْ بِنَهَرٍ فَمَنْ شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَمَنْ لَمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي إِلَّا مَنِ اغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ ۚ فَشَرِبُوا مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ قَالُوا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا الْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ ۚ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو اللَّهِ كَمْ مِنْ فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ"},{"verse":"250","text":"And when they went forth to [face] Goliath and his soldiers, they said, \"Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.\"","commentary":"As the small group of believers stood ready to confront Goliath and his army, this verse describes their <strong>sincere prayer to Allah</strong>. They beseeched Allah to <strong>grant them patience in the face of hardship, to make their footing firm, and to grant them victory over those who disbelieved</strong>. This verse directly follows the previous one, depicting the believers' reliance on Allah in a moment of great challenge, emphasizing their faith and their understanding that true strength and victory come from Him. Their prayer reflects their complete trust in Allah's power and their commitment to His cause.","arabic":"وَلَمَّا بَرَزُوا لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ قَالُوا رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"251","text":"So they defeated them by permission of Allah, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which He willed.

It specifically mentions that <strong>David slew Goliath</strong>, and that <strong>Allah bestowed upon David kingship, wisdom, and knowledge</strong>. The verse then offers a broader perspective, explaining that <strong>Allah's act of enabling different groups of people to counter one another prevents the earth from becoming utterly corrupt</strong>. It concludes by affirming that <strong>Allah’s bounty is limitless for all of creation</strong>. This verse serves as the climax of the narrative, demonstrating Allah's support for the faithful few and illustrating the principle that divine will is the ultimate determinant of victory. It also connects the specific historical event to a larger universal principle of balance and the boundless nature of Allah's grace.","arabic":"فَهَزَمُوهُمْ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَقَتَلَ دَاوُودُ جَالُوتَ وَآتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَهُ مِمَّا يَشَاءُ ۗ وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَفَسَدَتِ الْأَرْضُ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ"},{"verse":"252","text":"These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you, [O Muhammad], in truth.

It underscores the importance of understanding and reflecting upon these stories to gain wisdom and guidance for life.","arabic":"تِلْكَ آيَاتُ اللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَمِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ"},{"verse":"253","text":"Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit. If Allah had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allah does what He intends.","commentary":"This verse begins by highlighting the <strong>importance and distinct nature of messengers</strong> in the divine plan. It states that Allah has elevated some messengers above others, mentioning that Allah spoke directly to some (often understood to refer to Moses), and raised others in rank. Jesus, the son of Mary, is specifically mentioned as having been given clear signs (like the Gospel and miracles) and strengthened with the Holy Spirit (understood in this context as the angel Gabriel, who delivered divine messages).\r\n\r\nThe verse then addresses the <strong>differences and conflicts that arose among the followers of these messengers</strong> after clear guidance had been provided. It points out that if Allah had willed it, these later generations would not have fought each other, but they chose to differ, with some accepting the faith and others rejecting it. The verse concludes by emphasizing Allah's ultimate power and will, stating that Allah does whatever He wills. This verse connects to the previous passage by continuing the theme of divine revelation and the varied responses of people to it. It sets the stage for the following verses which address the responsibilities and choices of believers.","arabic":"تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۘ مِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَٰكِنِ اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَفَرَ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ"},{"verse":"254","text":"O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses <strong>believers</strong>, urging them to <strong>contribute from the provisions they have been given</strong> by Allah for His cause. The motivation for this spending is highlighted by the reminder of a future day when worldly means like trade, friendship, or intercession will be of no avail. This emphasizes the importance of acting righteously in the present life. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>those who reject faith are the wrongdoers</strong>, implying that their refusal to believe and act accordingly has negative consequences. This verse follows the previous one by outlining a practical action expected of those who have accepted the faith, in contrast to those who rejected it. It leads to the subsequent verse which introduces the unique attributes of Allah, for whose cause believers are asked to spend.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ"},{"verse":"255","text":"Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.

It begins by affirming that <strong>there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah</strong>, emphasizing His absolute oneness.

It emphasizes that <strong>religious faith is a matter of conviction and free choice</strong>, not coercion. The verse clarifies that <strong>\"the right way is henceforth distinct from error,\"</strong> meaning that the truth of belief in Allah is now clear and distinguishable from falsehood. It states that <strong>whoever rejects \"false deities\" (anything that takes precedence over Allah) and believes in Allah has grasped </strong>\"a most firm support that never breaks,\"<strong> symbolizing a strong and unbreakable bond with the Divine. The verse concludes by affirming that </strong>\"Allah hears all and knows all,\"** highlighting His awareness of people's choices and intentions. This verse follows the description of Allah's attributes by outlining a key implication of understanding His nature: freedom of belief.

It states that <strong>\"Allah is the Patron (Guardian, Supporter) of the believers,\"</strong> and that He <strong>\"leads them out of darkness into the light,\"</strong> symbolizing guidance, clarity, and truth. Conversely, <strong>\"as for the unbelievers, their patrons are false deities who lead them out of light into darkness,\"</strong> signifying misguidance and deviation from truth.

When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.","commentary":"This verse tells the story of a <strong>discussion between the Prophet Abraham and a king</strong> who argued with him about Abraham’s Lord. The commentary suggests that this king didn't deny the existence of a divine power but questioned Allah's sole authority and control over human affairs. The king's arrogance stemmed from the power Allah had granted him.\r\n\r\nAbraham stated that <strong>his Lord is the one who gives life and causes death</strong>, to which the king falsely claimed he could do the same, likely referring to his power over his subjects. To demonstrate the true nature of divine power, Abraham then pointed to a universally observable phenomenon, saying that <strong>Allah causes the sun to rise in the east and challenged the king to make it rise in the west</strong>. Faced with this undeniable reality, <strong>the king was left speechless and defeated</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah does not guide those who deliberately do wrong</strong>. This verse follows the preceding verses by presenting an example of rejecting divine truth even when faced with clear signs. It sets the stage for the next verse, which provides another illustration of Allah's power over life and death through a different narrative.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِي حَاجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِي يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِي وَأُمِيتُ ۖ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"259","text":"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin.

Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones [of this donkey] - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh.\" And when it became clear to him, he said, \"I know that Allah is over all things competent.\"","commentary":"This verse presents another instance highlighting <strong>Allah's power over life and death</strong>. It describes a person who passed by a completely ruined town and wondered how Allah could ever bring it back to life. In response to this questioning, <strong>Allah caused the person to die for a hundred years and then brought him back to life</strong>. Allah asked him how long he had remained in that state, and the person thought it had been only a day or part of a day. Allah then informed him that he had been dead for a hundred years and provided him with tangible evidence of Allah's power. His food and drink remained unspoiled, while his donkey was shown to him as bones being reassembled and covered with flesh. This was made a <strong>\"sign for mankind\"</strong> to illustrate Allah's ability to bring life after death. Upon witnessing this, the person acknowledged that <strong>Allah has power over all things</strong>. This verse connects to the previous one by continuing to illustrate Allah's power, specifically focusing on resurrection after destruction. It leads into the next verse, where the Prophet Abraham seeks further reassurance about how Allah gives life to the dead.","arabic":"أَوْ كَالَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْيِي هَٰذِهِ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا ۖ فَأَمَاتَهُ اللَّهُ مِائَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ ۖ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ ۖ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ ۖ قَالَ بَلْ لَبِثْتَ مِائَةَ عَامٍ فَانْظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ ۖ وَانْظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ ۖ وَانْظُرْ إِلَى الْعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنْشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا ۚ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"260","text":"And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.\" [Allah] said, \"Have you not believed?\" He said, \"Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied.\" [Allah] said, \"Take four birds and commit them to yourself. Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"","commentary":"This verse recounts an instance where the <strong>Prophet Abraham asked Allah to show him how He gives life to the dead</strong>. Allah responded by asking if Abraham had no faith, to which Abraham affirmed his belief but explained that he sought this demonstration to <strong>reassure his heart and attain deeper peace of mind</strong>. Allah then instructed Abraham to <strong>take four birds, cut them into pieces, and place a part of each bird on different mountains</strong>. Afterward, Abraham was told to <strong>call the birds back, and they would come to him swiftly</strong>, their parts rejoining and life returning to them. The verse concludes with the statement that <strong>Allah is Almighty and Wise</strong>. This episode illustrates that even prophets sought a deeper understanding of divine power, not out of disbelief but out of a desire for greater certainty. It connects to the preceding verse by providing another example of Allah's power over life and death, this time at the request of a prophet seeking personal reassurance. This concludes this passage, which focuses on the theme of Allah's absolute power, particularly in giving and taking life.","arabic":"وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۖ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِنْ ۖ قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِنْ لِيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِي ۖ قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِنَ الطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ اجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ادْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْيًا ۚ وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"},{"verse":"261","text":"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains.

It compares this spending to a single seed that grows to produce seven stalks, each bearing a hundred grains, resulting in a seven hundredfold increase. This is presented as an inspiring image of growth and multiplied return. The verse emphasizes that <strong>Allah can increase these rewards even more for whomever He chooses</strong>, highlighting Allah's boundless generosity and complete knowledge. This verse introduces the theme of charitable giving, which will be further elaborated in the subsequent verses.","arabic":"مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنْبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنْبُلَةٍ مِائَةُ حَبَّةٍ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يُضَاعِفُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"262","text":"Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders [of it] or [other] injury will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"This verse outlines the <strong>conditions for receiving the full reward for charitable giving</strong>. It states that those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and <strong>do not boast about their generosity or cause pain to the recipients</strong> will be rewarded by Allah. The commentary explains that bragging about giving is seen as negative because it inflates the giver's ego and can humiliate the receiver. Such sincere givers are assured that <strong>they will have nothing to fear in the future nor will they grieve over the past</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one by specifying the ethical manner in which charitable giving should be carried out, setting the stage for the next verse, which contrasts sincere giving with actions that diminish its value.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ لَا يُتْبِعُونَ مَا أَنْفَقُوا مَنًّا وَلَا أَذًى ۙ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"263","text":"Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Free of need and Forbearing.","commentary":"This verse emphasizes that <strong>treating people with kindness and overlooking their faults is better than giving charity if that charity is accompanied by hurtful words or actions</strong>. The commentary clarifies that charity should not be seen as a favor from the giver but rather as an obligation towards Allah. <strong>Allah is described as self-sufficient and forgiving</strong>, implying that humans should also strive to be forgiving and kind in their interactions, especially when offering assistance. This verse connects to the preceding verse by further emphasizing the importance of the attitude and behavior that should accompany charitable giving. It leads to the next verse, which uses an analogy to illustrate how improper motives can nullify the benefits of charitable acts.","arabic":"قَوْلٌ مَعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَا أَذًى ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"264","text":"O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day.

And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","commentary":"This verse warns against <strong>nullifying the reward of charitable giving through boastfulness or by hurting the recipient's feelings</strong>. It likens the actions of someone who gives to impress others, without true belief in Allah or accountability in the Hereafter, to <strong>a smooth rock thinly covered with soil</strong>. When heavy rain falls, the soil is washed away, leaving the rock bare and unable to produce anything. Similarly, such insincere acts of charity will yield no spiritual benefit. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah does not guide those who reject faith</strong>. This verse elaborates on the negative behaviors mentioned in the previous verses, using a vivid analogy to highlight their futility. It sets a contrast for the next verse, which describes the reward of sincere giving.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُبْطِلُوا صَدَقَاتِكُمْ بِالْمَنِّ وَالْأَذَىٰ كَالَّذِي يُنْفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَاءَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۖ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا ۖ لَا يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَافِرِينَ"},{"verse":"265","text":"And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of Allah and assuring [reward for] themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yields its fruits in double.

And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.","commentary":"This verse presents a contrasting image to the previous one, describing the <strong>reward of those who give sincerely, seeking Allah's pleasure and with firm conviction</strong>. They are compared to <strong>a fertile garden on a hillside</strong>. Whether it receives heavy rain or just a light drizzle, it yields abundant produce. This illustrates that even small acts of sincere giving are valuable and will be rewarded by Allah. The verse ends by affirming that <strong>Allah is aware of all actions and the intentions behind them</strong>. This verse directly contrasts with the analogy in the preceding verse, highlighting the positive outcome of sincere charity and preparing for the next verse, which uses another powerful image to emphasize the potential loss of insincere good deeds.","arabic":"وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِنْ لَمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ"},{"verse":"266","text":"Would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from every fruit?

Thus does Allah make clear to you [His] verses that you might give thought.","commentary":"This verse uses a poignant rhetorical question to illustrate the <strong>disastrous outcome of insincere charity or good deeds that are later nullified</strong>. It asks if anyone would desire to possess a beautiful, fruitful garden with flowing streams, especially in old age with vulnerable children to provide for, only to have it completely destroyed by a fiery whirlwind. This vivid imagery represents how the benefits of charity can be utterly lost due to negative actions or impure intentions. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah clarifies His messages so that people may think deeply</strong>. This verse serves as a powerful warning against actions that can negate the value of giving and connects to the preceding verses that discussed the ethics of charity. It leads into the next verse, which focuses on the quality of what is given in charity.","arabic":"أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَاءُ فَأَصَابَهَا إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَاحْتَرَقَتْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ"},{"verse":"267","text":"O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth.

It urges them not to donate inferior items, the kind they themselves would not accept without reluctance. The commentary mentions a historical context where some people would donate dates of poor quality. The verse concludes by reminding them that <strong>Allah is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise</strong>, implying that people should give the best out of gratitude, not because Allah is in need. This verse follows the warnings about the manner of giving by now focusing on the quality of what is given. It connects to the next verse, which discusses the psychological influences on charitable giving.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْفِقُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّا أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ ۖ وَلَا تَيَمَّمُوا الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنْفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُمْ بِآخِذِيهِ إِلَّا أَنْ تُغْمِضُوا فِيهِ ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ"},{"verse":"268","text":"Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty.

It states that <strong>Satan instills the fear of poverty to discourage generosity and tempts people towards immoral behavior</strong>. In contrast, <strong>Allah promises forgiveness and abundant blessings</strong> in return for giving. The verse concludes by emphasizing that <strong>Allah is generous and fully aware of people's intentions</strong>. This verse explains the internal conflict people might face regarding charity and connects the act of giving to broader spiritual forces. It leads to the next verse, which discusses the concept of wisdom.","arabic":"الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُمْ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَعِدُكُمْ مَغْفِرَةً مِنْهُ وَفَضْلًا ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"269","text":"He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good.

The verse emphasizes that <strong>whoever is granted wisdom has been given a great good</strong>. It concludes by saying that <strong>only those with understanding minds will take heed</strong> of these teachings. This verse elaborates on Allah's attributes mentioned in the previous verse, specifically His knowledge and how He bestows understanding. It connects to the next verse, which discusses Allah's comprehensive knowledge of all charitable acts and vows.","arabic":"يُؤْتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَنْ يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّا أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"270","text":"And whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows - indeed, Allah knows of it.

The commentary clarifies that vows should be made for the sake of Allah alone. The verse also warns that <strong>wrongdoers, those who neglect their obligations and are ungrateful, will find no one to assist them</strong>. This verse reiterates Allah's knowledge of human actions and connects back to the theme of sincerity in giving. It leads to the next verse, which discusses the merits of giving charity openly versus in secret.","arabic":"وَمَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ نَفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُمْ مِنْ نَذْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُ ۗ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ"},{"verse":"271","text":"If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds [thereby]. And Allah, with what you do, is [fully] Acquainted.","commentary":"This verse discusses the <strong>two ways of giving charitable donations: openly and secretly</strong>. It states that <strong>both are acceptable</strong>, but <strong>giving in private is considered better for the giver and can lead to the forgiveness of some wrong actions</strong>. The commentary suggests that publicizing obligatory charity can encourage others, while private giving is generally better for voluntary charity as it helps maintain sincerity. The verse concludes by affirming once again that <strong>Allah is aware of everything people do</strong>. This verse provides practical guidance on the manner of giving and connects to the preceding verse by continuing the theme of Allah's awareness of all deeds. It leads to the next verse, which addresses the role of the Prophet (and by extension, all believers) in guiding others.","arabic":"إِنْ تُبْدُوا الصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِيَ ۖ وَإِنْ تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا الْفُقَرَاءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۚ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنْكُمْ مِنْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ"},{"verse":"272","text":"Not upon you, [O Muhammad], is [responsibility for] their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever good you [believers] spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of Allah. And whatever you spend of good - it will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.","commentary":"This verse clarifies the <strong>limits of human ability to guide others</strong>, stating that <strong>true guidance comes from Allah alone</strong>. It emphasizes that the Prophet's (and by extension, any individual's) role is to convey the message, and Allah decides who receives guidance. The verse also reiterates the <strong>benefit of charitable giving for the giver themselves</strong>, stressing that <strong>spending should be purely for the sake of Allah</strong>. It assures that <strong>whatever good is given in charity will be fully recompensed, and no one will be treated unjustly</strong>. This verse shifts focus slightly to address the responsibility of guidance while still reinforcing the importance and benefits of sincere charity. It connects to the next verse by describing a specific group of deserving recipients of charity.","arabic":"لَيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِأَنْفُسِكُمْ ۚ وَمَا تُنْفِقُونَ إِلَّا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"273","text":"[Charity is] for the poor who have been restricted for the cause of Allah, unable to move about in the land.

And whatever you spend of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.","commentary":"This verse specifies a <strong>particular group of people who are especially deserving of charitable support</strong>: those who are dedicated to the cause of Allah and are therefore unable to seek their own sustenance. The commentary mentions the historical example of early Muslims who migrated and devoted themselves to the community. The verse highlights that these individuals are often mistaken for being wealthy due to their dignified and self-restrained manner, and they do not beg for assistance. It concludes by assuring that <strong>Allah is fully aware of any good given to such people</strong>. This verse provides a specific example of those who should be prioritized in charitable giving and connects to the previous verse by illustrating the practical application of spending for Allah's cause. It leads to the final verse of this passage, which offers a general reassurance about the rewards of charity.","arabic":"لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الَّذِينَ أُحْصِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِي الْأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَاءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُمْ بِسِيمَاهُمْ لَا يَسْأَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا ۗ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"274","text":"Those who spend their wealth [in Allah 's way] by night and by day, secretly and publicly - they will have their reward with their Lord.

It affirms that <strong>they will receive their reward from Allah</strong>. Furthermore, it assures them that <strong>they will have no reason to fear any future adversity nor will they grieve over past losses</strong>. This verse serves as a concluding summary of the entire section on charitable giving, emphasizing the consistent and comprehensive nature of Allah's reward for generosity, and provides a sense of closure to this thematic unit.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"275","text":"Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, \"Trade is [just] like interest.\" But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.","commentary":"This verse begins by depicting a striking image of those who practice usury, comparing their state to someone affected by delusion. The commentary suggests this imagery highlights the profound negative impact of usury on individuals and society. The verse notes that usurers try to justify their practice by claiming it is no different from trade, but it clearly states that <strong>Allah has permitted trade while prohibiting usury</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe verse then offers a way forward for those who have engaged in usury: if they receive this guidance and stop the practice, they may keep their past earnings, with their final judgment left to Allah. However, it strongly warns that those who return to usury will face severe consequences. This verse establishes a clear distinction between permissible trade and forbidden usury, and sets out initial guidance for those involved in usurious practices at the time of this revelation. It connects to the theme of financial dealings discussed in the broader passage, contrasting the ethical principles of charity from the previous section with the harmful nature of usury. The verse that follows emphasizes the contrasting outcomes of usury and charitable giving.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَا لَا يَقُومُونَ إِلَّا كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَا ۗ وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا ۚ فَمَنْ جَاءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ فَانْتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ"},{"verse":"276","text":"Allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allah does not like every sinning disbeliever.","commentary":"This verse continues the contrast between usury and charity, stating that <strong>Allah diminishes the benefits of usury while increasing the rewards of charitable giving</strong>. This can be understood both in a spiritual and potentially a worldly sense, where usury may lead to instability and charity to growth and cooperation within a community. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>Allah does not favor those who knowingly persist in wrongdoing</strong>, specifically in this context, the practice of usury after having received clear guidance against it.\r\n\r\nThis verse directly follows the warning against reverting to usury in the previous verse, emphasizing the negative consequences and Allah's disapproval of such actions. It also sets the stage for the subsequent verse, which describes the characteristics and rewards of those who believe and act righteously, particularly in the context of financial obligations like Zakat (a form of obligatory charity in Islam).","arabic":"يَمْحَقُ اللَّهُ الرِّبَا وَيُرْبِي الصَّدَقَاتِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ"},{"verse":"277","text":"Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakah will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","commentary":"In contrast to those who engage in usury, this verse describes <strong>those who believe, do good deeds, are consistent in their prayers, and pay Zakat (a form of obligatory charity)</strong>. It assures them that <strong>they will receive their reward from their Lord and will have no reason to fear future events or grieve over the past</strong>. This verse highlights the importance of faith, righteous actions, and fulfilling financial obligations as key aspects of a moral and spiritual life.\r\n\r\nThis verse provides a direct contrast to the condemnation of usury in the preceding verses. It introduces the concept of Zakat as a positive and essential financial practice within a community of believers, highlighting its role in creating a caring and supportive society as an alternative to usury. It leads into the following verses which address the specific issue of dealing with outstanding usurious gains upon receiving this guidance.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ"},{"verse":"278","text":"O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.","commentary":"This verse directly addresses believers, urging them to <strong>fear Allah and relinquish any outstanding amounts of money gained through usury</strong>. It connects this act of giving up usurious gains with the sincerity of their belief. This is a direct command to implement the prohibition of usury, asking those who had previously engaged in it to abandon any remaining profits derived from it upon receiving this divine guidance.\r\n\r\nFollowing the description of the righteous believers and the contrast with usurers, this verse provides a concrete directive for those who believe to actively dismantle any existing usurious practices. It sets the condition for being \"true believers\" on their willingness to comply with this instruction. The subsequent verse outlines the consequences of not adhering to this command and the provision for those who repent.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَذَرُوا مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الرِّبَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"279","text":"And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.","commentary":"This verse issues a <strong>strong warning to those who do not abandon usury</strong>, stating that they will be in a state of <strong>\"war\" against Allah and His Messenger</strong>. This emphasizes the severity of the prohibition of usury in this context. However, the verse also offers a path of reconciliation: <strong>if individuals repent from usury, they are entitled to recover their original capital but must forgo any interest charged</strong>. This ensures that while usury is forbidden, the initial investment is protected, establishing a principle of fairness and preventing undue loss upon ceasing the practice.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the previous verse's call to abandon usury, this verse highlights the gravity of rejecting this instruction. It provides both a stern consequence for non-compliance and a merciful provision for those who choose to repent, ensuring a just transition away from usurious practices. The verse that follows addresses the situation of debtors facing financial hardship.","arabic":"فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُوا فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُمْ لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"280","text":"And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease. But if you give [from your right as] charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.","commentary":"This verse shifts focus to the treatment of debtors, particularly those facing financial difficulties. It instructs creditors to <strong>grant a postponement to debtors who are in hardship until they are able to repay</strong>. Furthermore, it encourages creditors to go beyond simply delaying repayment and to <strong>forgive the debt entirely as an act of charity</strong>, stating that this is even better for them. This promotes compassion, understanding, and mutual support in financial dealings.\r\n\r\nFollowing the strong stance against usury and the provision for repayment of the principal, this verse introduces an element of mercy and social responsibility in lending practices. It emphasizes the importance of considering the debtor's circumstances and encourages generosity, linking financial interactions with ethical and charitable considerations. This leads to the final verse of this passage, which serves as a reminder of accountability before Allah.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ ۚ وَأَنْ تَصَدَّقُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ ۖ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"281","text":"And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly.","commentary":"This final verse of the passage serves as a <strong>solemn reminder of the Day of Judgment</strong>, when all individuals will be brought before Allah to account for their actions. It emphasizes that <strong>every soul will be fully recompensed for what it has earned, and no one will be treated unjustly</strong>. This acts as a powerful motivation for both avoiding prohibited practices like usury and adhering to ethical principles in financial dealings, such as showing compassion to debtors and giving charity.\r\n\r\nThis verse concludes the discussion on usury and related financial ethics by placing them within the broader context of accountability to Allah. It underscores the ultimate consequences of one's actions and reinforces the importance of adhering to divine guidance in all aspects of life, including financial matters. This passage, therefore, moves from a condemnation of usury and a call to abandon it, to the reward for righteous conduct and the importance of compassion in lending, ending with a powerful reminder of ultimate justice.","arabic":"وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"282","text":"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear Allah. And Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knowing of all things.","commentary":"Following the discussion on fair financial practices and the prohibition of usury in the preceding verses, this verse provides <strong>practical guidelines for managing financial obligations, specifically debts</strong>. The general recommendation is that <strong>all fixed-term loans should be recorded in writing</strong>. This should be done by an <strong>impartial scribe who records the terms fairly</strong>, acting as a duty to Allah who has given him this ability.\r\n\r\nThe verse specifies that <strong>the borrower (debtor) should dictate the terms</strong> of the loan, being mindful of Allah and ensuring accuracy. This is seen as a safeguard against potential injustice to the borrower, considered the weaker party in the transaction. If the borrower is unable to dictate due to mental or physical reasons, their <strong>guardian can dictate on their behalf with fairness</strong>.\r\n\r\nFor ensuring the validity of the agreement, the verse recommends having <strong>two male witnesses</strong>. If two men are not available, then <strong>one man and two women</strong> can act as witnesses. The reason for needing two women is explained as a measure to ensure accuracy, so that if one of them makes an error, the other can remind her. Witnesses are instructed <strong>not to refuse when called upon</strong> to witness an agreement, as this is seen as a way to uphold justice and rights.\r\n\r\nThe verse further advises <strong>against hesitating to write down debts, regardless of their size or duration</strong>, as this is considered more just by Allah, strengthens the testimony, and helps avoid future doubts. An exception is made for <strong>immediate commercial transactions</strong>, where writing down the details is not obligatory. This verse establishes a framework for secure and transparent lending practices, emphasizing fairness and the prevention of disputes. It lays the groundwork for the subsequent verse, which addresses specific situations related to lending while traveling.","arabic":"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا تَدَايَنْتُمْ بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى فَاكْتُبُوهُ ۚ وَلْيَكْتُبْ بَيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ ۚ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا أَوْ ضَعِيفًا أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَاسْتَشْهِدُوا شَهِيدَيْنِ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَامْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّنْ تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَاءِ أَنْ تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الْأُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَاءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُوا ۚ وَلَا تَسْأَمُوا أَنْ تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَىٰ أَجَلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَادَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰ أَلَّا تَرْتَابُوا ۖ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلَّا تَكْتُبُوهَا ۗ وَأَشْهِدُوا إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ ۚ وَلَا يُضَارَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلَا شَهِيدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"283","text":"And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit [should be] taken.

In such cases, <strong>taking a physical pledge or security from the borrower</strong> is deemed sufficient. This provides a tangible guarantee for the lender when a written contract and witnesses might not be readily available.\r\n\r\nHowever, the verse also acknowledges the importance of <strong>trust</strong> in financial dealings. If the lender trusts the borrower, a <strong>verbal agreement is considered valid</strong>, and the borrower is urged to <strong>fulfill their trust and be mindful of Allah</strong>. This highlights the ethical dimension of financial transactions, where honesty and trustworthiness are highly valued.\r\n\r\nThe verse then shifts to the broader responsibility of <strong>giving testimony</strong>. It states firmly that <strong>one should not withhold testimony when called upon</strong>, as doing so is considered a sin. This underscores the importance of truthfulness and cooperation in upholding justice within the community. The verse concludes with a powerful reminder that <strong>Allah has full knowledge of all actions</strong>, serving as a motivation for honesty and integrity in all dealings, including financial matters and providing testimony. This leads into the next verse, which broadens the scope to Allah's ultimate knowledge and authority over all things.","arabic":"وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُوا كَاتِبًا فَرِهَانٌ مَقْبُوضَةٌ ۖ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِي اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ ۗ وَلَا تَكْتُمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ ۚ وَمَنْ يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"284","text":"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and Allah is over all things competent.","commentary":"This verse concludes the section on financial regulations with a <strong>declaration of Allah's absolute sovereignty and knowledge</strong>. It emphasizes that <strong>everything in the universe belongs to Allah</strong>. This reinforces the idea that all human dealings, including those related to finance and debt, occur within the realm of Allah's ownership and authority.\r\n\r\nMore significantly, the verse states that <strong>Allah is aware of everything in people's minds, whether it is expressed or kept hidden</strong>, and that <strong>He will hold everyone accountable for their thoughts and intentions</strong>. This takes the concept of responsibility beyond mere actions and words, encompassing the inner state of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe verse ends by asserting Allah's ultimate authority in <strong>forgiving whom He wills and punishing whom He wills</strong>, and that <strong>He has power over all things</strong>. This serves as a powerful reminder of the ultimate accountability that everyone will face. It connects to the preceding verses by highlighting that the guidelines for financial transactions and the importance of honesty and trustworthiness are not just societal recommendations but are part of a larger framework of divine accountability. This verse provides a concluding perspective, emphasizing that all human actions and intentions are ultimately subject to Allah's judgment.","arabic":"لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَإِنْ تُبْدُوا مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ اللَّهُ ۖ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"285","text":"The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers.

[We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.\"","commentary":"This verse serves as a <strong>summary of the core beliefs</strong> held by the Prophet Muhammad and his followers. Following the extensive discussions in the preceding verses about various aspects of life and faith, including financial dealings and divine authority, this verse <strong>affirms the fundamental unity of their belief system</strong>.\r\n\r\nIt highlights several key aspects:\r\n*   <strong>Belief in Allah:</strong> This is the central tenet, acknowledging Allah as the one and only Supreme Being.\r\n*   <strong>Belief in Angels:</strong> These are spiritual beings created by Allah.\r\n*   <strong>Belief in Divine Books:</strong> This includes the holy scriptures revealed by Allah to various messengers, emphasizing a continuity of divine guidance.\r\n*   <strong>Belief in Messengers:</strong> This acknowledges all the prophets sent by Allah, emphasizing that believers do not differentiate between them. This underscores the idea that the core message of these messengers is consistent.\r\n\r\nThe verse concludes with the believers' declaration: <strong>“We hear and we obey”</strong>, signifying their acceptance of divine guidance. Their plea for forgiveness, <strong>“Grant us Your forgiveness, our Lord”</strong>, acknowledges human fallibility. The final statement, <strong>“to You we shall all return”</strong>, emphasizes the belief in an eventual accountability to Allah. This verse connects to the previous ones by providing the foundational beliefs that underpin the guidance offered, and it sets the stage for the final verse of the chapter, which contains a prayer based on these beliefs.","arabic":"آمَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۚ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْ رُسُلِهِ ۚ وَقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"286","text":"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.

This highlights the idea of fairness and understanding in divine expectations. The verse then emphasizes <strong>individual accountability</strong>, stating that each person is responsible for their own good and bad deeds. This reinforces the importance of personal responsibility in the context of the beliefs affirmed in the preceding verse.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the verse is a <strong>prayer</strong> expressing the believers' reliance on Allah and their awareness of human limitations:\r\n*   They ask not to be held accountable for <strong>unintentional errors or forgetfulness</strong>.\r\n*   They pray not to be burdened with <strong>excessive trials</strong>, drawing on the experiences of past communities.\r\n*   They beseech Allah not to burden them with what they <strong>cannot endure</strong>.\r\n*   Finally, they ask for <strong>pardon, forgiveness, and mercy</strong>, acknowledging their need for divine grace.\r\n\r\nThe concluding statement, <strong>“You are our Lord Supreme; grant us victory against the unbelievers,”</strong> reflects the believers' trust in Allah as their ultimate support and their aspiration for the triumph of their values. This verse connects to the previous one by demonstrating the practical implications of their faith, leading to a posture of humility, reliance on divine mercy, and a desire for righteousness. It brings the extensive discussions of the chapter to a close by emphasizing Allah's justice and the believers' dependence on His grace.","arabic":"لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِنْ نَسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ ۖ وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا ۚ أَنْتَ مَوْلَانَا فَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ"}];
