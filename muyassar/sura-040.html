          <p class="arabic">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانَتْ تَأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَكَفَرُوا فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ قَوِيٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they persisted in disbelief. So Allah seized them. Surely He is All-Powerful, severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">That punishment that befell the previous deniers was because of their stance towards the messengers of Allah who came with decisive proofs of the truth of their claim, but they disbelieved in them, and denied them, so Allah seized them with His punishment. Indeed, He, the Exalted, is Powerful, none can overcome Him, Severe in punishment for those who disbelieve in Him and disobey Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The destruction of past nations occurred because they rejected the clear proofs brought by the messengers of Allah. Allah's power and severe punishment are highlighted as consequences of disbelief.</p>

And if Moses is a liar, then the consequence of his lie will fall upon him alone. But if he is truthful, then some of that which he threatens you with will befall you. Indeed, Allah does not guide to the truth one who is transgressing the limits, by abandoning the truth and embracing falsehood, a liar in attributing what he has exceeded to Allah.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">A believer from Pharaoh's people questioned the logic of killing Moses simply for proclaiming Allah as his Lord, especially when Moses had come with clear proofs. He warns that if Moses is truthful, they may face the consequences.</p>

          <h2>Verse 43</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّمَا تَدْعُونَنِي إِلَيْهِ لَيْسَ لَهُ دَعْوَةٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ مَرَدَّنَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَأَنَّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ هُمْ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">There is no doubt that whatever ˹idols˺ you invite me to ˹worship˺ are not worthy to be invoked either in this world or the Hereafter. ˹Undoubtedly,˺ our return is to Allah, and the transgressors will be the inmates of the Fire.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Truly, what you call me to believe in does not deserve to be called upon, nor to be turned to in this world or the Hereafter due to its helplessness and deficiency. And know that the destiny of all creation is to Allah, the Most Glorified. He will recompense every worker for his work, and those who transgress His limits with sins, bloodshed, and disbelief are the people of Hellfire.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The believer emphasizes that the idols they worship are powerless and that all will return to Allah for judgment. This underscores the futility of idolatry and the certainty of the Hereafter.</p>
