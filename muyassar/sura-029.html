There is no obedience to a creature, whoever he may be, in disobedience to Allah, as it has been proven from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. To Me is your return on the Day of Resurrection, and I will inform you of what you used to do in the world, of good and bad deeds, and I will recompense you for it.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire. Surely in this are signs for people who believe.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So the answer of Abraham's people was nothing but that some of them said to others: Kill him or burn him with fire. So they threw him into it, and Allah saved him from it and made it cool and safe for him. Indeed, in Our saving of Abraham from the fire are signs and proofs for a people who believe in Allah and act according to His law.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Prophet Abraham's people tried to kill him by burning him, but Allah saved him from the fire. This is a clear sign for believers of Allah's power and protection.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, ˹genuine˺ prayer should deter ˹one˺ from indecency and wickedness. The remembrance of Allah is ˹an˺ even greater ˹deterrent˺. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you ˹all˺ do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Recite what has been revealed to you of this Quran, and act according to it, and perform prayer with its due boundaries. Indeed, the observance of prayer prevents its performer from falling into sins and evil deeds, and that is because the one who establishes it, completing its pillars and conditions, his heart is illuminated, his faith increases, and his desire for good is strengthened, and his desire for evil decreases or disappears. And the remembrance of Allah in prayer and other things is greater, more important, and better than everything. And Allah knows what you do of good and evil, and He will reward you for that completely and fully.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse urges the recitation of the Quran and the establishment of prayer.  Genuine prayer deters one from evil, and the remembrance of Allah is even more significant. Allah is fully aware of all our actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. And say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is ˹only˺ One. And to Him we ˹fully˺ submit.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not argue - O believers - with the Jews and Christians except in the best manner, with good words, and calling to the truth in the easiest way to achieve that, except for those who deviate from the path of truth, oppose, are obstinate, and declare war against you, so fight them with the sword until they believe or give the jizya with willing submission and in a state of subjection. And say: We believe in the Quran that was revealed to us, and we believe in the Torah and the Gospel that were revealed to you. Our God and your God is one, with no partner in His divinity, nor in His Lordship, nor in His names and attributes, and we are submissive to Him, humbling ourselves in obedience to what He has commanded us and forbidden us.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to engage in respectful dialogue with the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), using good words and gentle means. It emphasizes the shared belief in one God and submission to Him. However, it allows for fighting those who are oppressive.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And just as We sent down - O Messenger - the Books to those before you of the Messengers, We sent down to you this Book confirming the previous Books. So those to whom We gave the Book from the Children of Israel, and recognized it as it should be recognized, believe in the Quran. And among these Arabs from Quraysh and others are those who believe in it. And no one denies the Quran or doubts its clear indications and proofs except the disbelievers whose habit is denial and stubbornness.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse confirms that the Quran, like previous scriptures, is a divine revelation. It notes that some People of the Book and some from the pagan Arabs believe in it. Only the disbelievers deny its truth.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Among your clear miracles - O Messenger - is that you did not read a book nor write letters with your right hand before the revelation of the Quran to you, and they know that. If you were a reader or writer before the revelation came to you, the falsifiers would have doubted it, and they would have said: He learned it from previous books or copied it from them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet's inability to read or write before receiving the Quran is presented as a clear sign of its divine origin. It eliminates any claim that the Prophet copied the Quran from previous sources.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">So let them be ungrateful for all We have given them, and ˹let them˺ enjoy themselves ˹for now˺! For they will soon know.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when the disbelievers embark on ships in the sea and fear drowning, they single out Allah, and sincerely supplicate to Him in their distress. But when He delivers them to the land and the distress is removed from them, they revert to their polytheism. Indeed, they contradict themselves. They single out Allah in the hour of distress, and associate partners with Him in times of ease. And their polytheism after our favor upon them by deliverance from the sea will result in the denial of what We have bestowed upon them in themselves and their wealth, and so they complete their enjoyment in this world. They will soon know the corruption of their deeds, and what Allah has prepared for them of a painful punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And in that is a threat and a warning for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse is a warning to those who are ungrateful for Allah's blessings and who indulge in worldly pleasures. They will soon face the consequences of their actions.</p>

          <h2>Verse 67</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا آمِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ ۚ أَفَبِالْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَكْفُرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Have they not seen how We have made ˹Mecca˺ a safe haven, whereas people ˹all˺ around them are snatched away? How can they then believe in falsehood and deny Allah’s favours?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Do the disbelievers of Mecca not see that Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary, secure for them? In it its people are safe in their lives and wealth, while people around them outside the sanctuary are snatched away, insecure? Do they believe in polytheism and disbelieve in Allah's favor that he has favored them with, not worshiping Him alone without others?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse questions why people deny Allah's favors, specifically highlighting the safety of Mecca as a sign of His grace. It contrasts this with the instability and danger that others experience.</p>

          <h2>Verse 68</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِالْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَاءَهُ ۚ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِلْكَافِرِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or reject the truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah, attributing his misguidance and falsehood to Allah, or denies the truth that Allah has sent with His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him? Indeed, in the Fire is a dwelling for those who disbelieve in Allah, deny His Oneness, and reject His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse identifies those who invent lies about Allah or deny the truth as the most unjust of people. Their abode is Hellfire.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And those who have believed and struggled against the enemies of Allah, themselves, and Satan, and were patient in trials and tribulations in the way of Allah, Allah will guide them to the paths of goodness and make them steadfast on the straight path. And whoever is like that is an doer of good to himself and others. And indeed, Allah, the Most High, is surely with those who do good from his creation with victory, support, preservation, and guidance.</p>
