          <p class="muyassar">And if you ask - O Messenger - these polytheists in Allah: Who created the heavens and the earth? they will surely say, 'Allah.' So if they say that, then say to them: 'All praise is due to Allah,' who has manifested the proof to you from yourselves, but most of these polytheists do not consider or contemplate who it is that deserves the praise and thanks, and that is why they associated others with Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Even the polytheists acknowledge that Allah created the heavens and earth. Therefore, all praise belongs to Him. Yet, most people fail to understand the implications of this.</p>
