          <p class="arabic">أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِالدِّينِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have you seen the state of that one who denies the Resurrection and the Recompense?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse questions the attitude of those who deny the Day of Judgment.</p>

          <h2>Verse 2</h2>
          <p class="arabic">فَذَٰلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">That is the one who repulses the orphan,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">For that is the one who pushes the orphan away with violence and harshness from his right due to the hardness of his heart.</p>
          <p class="explanation">It describes a characteristic of the deniers as being harsh and dismissive towards orphans.</p>

          <h2>Verse 3</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and does not encourage the feeding of the poor.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And does not urge others to feed the needy, so how can he feed them himself?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Another characteristic of deniers is that they neither feed the poor themselves nor encourage others to do so.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">yet are unmindful of their prayers;</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So woe to those who pray, who are heedless of their prayer, do not perform it properly, nor do they offer it on time.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes that it's not just about praying, but about doing so attentively and sincerely.</p>

          <p class="arabic">الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">those who ˹only˺ show off,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who make a show of good deeds for the sake of people.</p>
          <p class="explanation">It identifies those who pray only to show off to others as being among the heedless.</p>

          <h2>Verse 7</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and refuse to give ˹even the simplest˺ aid.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And they withhold lending what is not harmful to lend, from utensils and other things; neither have they perfected worship of their Lord, nor have they done good to His creation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights another sign of hypocrisy: refusing to lend or give even simple aid to those in need.</p>
