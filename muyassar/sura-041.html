Instead, they assumed Allah was not fully aware of their deeds. This flawed perception was a mistake that contributed to their downfall.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">You did not conceal yourselves when you committed sins, fearing that your hearing, your sight, or your skins would testify against you on the Day of Resurrection. Rather, you thought, when committing sins, that Allah did not know much of what you were doing in your disobedience to Allah.

          <p class="explanation">The verse continues to emphasize the point that having a false perception of Allah, thinking He did not know much of their deeds, led to their destruction and they have become among the losers.</p>

          <p class="arabic">مَا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ وَذُو عِقَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹O Prophet!˺ Nothing is said to you ˹by the deniers˺ except what was already said to the messengers before you. Surely your Lord is ˹the Lord˺ of forgiveness and painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These polytheists say to you - O Messenger - nothing but what those before them from the nations said to their messengers. So be patient with what befalls you in the path of calling to Allah. Indeed, your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness for the sins of the repentant, and the Possessor of punishment for whoever persists in his disbelief and denial.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse comforts the Prophet (peace be upon him), stating that the rejection he faces is not unique. It emphasizes that while Allah is forgiving, He also has the power to inflict severe punishment.</p>

          <h2>Verse 44</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا أَعْجَمِيًّا لَقَالُوا لَوْلَا فُصِّلَتْ آيَاتُهُ ۖ أَأَعْجَمِيٌّ وَعَرَبِيٌّ ۗ قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا هُدًى وَشِفَاءٌ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ فِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِنْ مَكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Had We revealed it as a non-Arabic Quran, they would have certainly argued, “If only its verses were made clear ˹in our language˺. What! A non-Arabic revelation for an Arab audience!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is a guide and a healing to the believers. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears and blindness to it ˹in their hearts˺. It is as if they are being called from a faraway place.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We had made this Quran that We sent down upon you - O Messenger - non-Arabic, the polytheists would have said: 'Why are its verses not explained, so we can understand it and know it? Is this Quran non-Arabic, while the tongue of the one upon whom it was sent down is Arabic?' This cannot be. Say to them - O Messenger -: This Quran is for those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, a guidance from misguidance, and a cure for what is in the hearts of doubts and diseases. And those who do not believe in the Quran, in their ears is deafness from hearing it and pondering it, and upon their hearts is blindness, so they are not guided by it. Those polytheists are like one being called out to, while he is in a distant place, not hearing a caller, nor responding to an announcer.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains why the Quran was revealed in Arabic. It says it is guidance and healing for believers, but those who disbelieve are likened to people who are deaf and blind to truth, unresponsive to the divine call.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ فَاخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ ۗ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِنْ رَبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِنْهُ مُرِيبٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming doubt about it.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We have indeed given Moses the Torah, just as We have given you - O Messenger - the Quran, and his people differed in it: some of them believed, and some of them denied. And if not for a word that had preceded from your Lord about the postponement of punishment from your people, it would have been decided between them by destroying the disbelievers immediately. And indeed, the polytheists are in great doubt about the Quran, a deep suspicion.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse draws a parallel with the Torah given to Moses, highlighting that differences and doubts arose then, as they do now with the Quran. It suggests that Allah's prior decree is the reason for delaying immediate punishment for disbelief. </p>

          <p class="quran-text">Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Your Lord is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Whoever does good, obeying Allah and His Messenger, then for himself is the reward of his deed; and whoever does evil, disobeying Allah and His Messenger, then upon himself is the burden of his deed. And your Lord is not unjust to the servants, by decreasing a good deed or increasing an evil deed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse underscores individual responsibility and accountability. It clarifies that good deeds benefit the doer, while evil deeds harm them, and emphasizes that Allah is never unjust to His creation.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِلَيْهِ يُرَدُّ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ ۚ وَمَا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ ثَمَرَاتٍ مِنْ أَكْمَامِهَا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَىٰ وَلَا تَضَعُ إِلَّا بِعِلْمِهِ ۚ وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَائِي قَالُوا آذَنَّاكَ مَا مِنَّا مِنْ شَهِيدٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its husk, nor does a female conceive or deliver without His knowledge. And ˹consider˺ the Day He will call to those ˹pagans˺, “Where are My ˹so-called˺ associate-gods?” They will cry, “We declare before you that none of us testifies to that ˹any longer˺.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">To Allah Almighty alone, who has no partners, is the knowledge of the Hour returned. For no one knows when it will occur except Him. And no fruits emerge from their casings, and no female conceives or delivers her burden except with the knowledge of Allah. Nothing is hidden from Him in that. And on the day Allah Almighty calls out to the polytheists on the Day of Resurrection, rebuking them and showing their falsehood: 'Where are My partners whom you used to associate with Me in My worship?' They will say: 'We inform you now, there is no one among us who testifies today that You have a partner.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes that only Allah knows when the Hour (Day of Judgment) will occur. It also states that all natural events, like the emergence of fruit and childbirth, happen with His knowledge. On the Day of Judgment, those who associated partners with Allah will deny they ever did so.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And if We let them taste a mercy from Us after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what I deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.” But We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We will certainly make them taste a harsh torment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We cause man to taste a blessing from Us after hardship and affliction, he does not thank Allah Almighty, but rather transgresses and says: 'This has come to me because I am deserving of it,' and does not believe that the Hour is coming. This is denial of the Resurrection from him, and assuming that the Hour is coming and that I will return to my Lord, then I will have Paradise with Him. We will surely inform those who disbelieved on the Day of Resurrection of what they did of evil deeds, and We will surely make them taste severe punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes people who, when blessed after hardship, attribute it to their own merit and deny the Day of Judgment. They assume they will be rewarded even if they return to Allah, but disbelievers will face severe punishment for their actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">When We show favour to someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil, they make endless prayers ˹for good˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when We bestow favor upon man with health or provision or other things, he turns away and is arrogant about submitting to the truth, but if harm befalls him, he is full of supplications that Allah remove his harm. Thus, he recognizes his Lord in hardship but does not recognize Him in ease.</p>
