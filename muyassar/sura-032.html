          <p class="quran-text">Or do they say, “He has fabricated it!”? No! It is the truth from your Lord in order for you to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so they may be ˹rightly˺ guided.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Rather, do the polytheists say: Muhammad, peace be upon him, fabricated the Quran? They have lied. Rather, it is the established truth revealed to you - O Messenger - from your Lord; to warn thereby a people to whom no warner has come before you, so that they may be guided, recognize the truth, believe in it, and prefer it, and believe in you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse challenges those who claim the Quran is fabricated, asserting it is the truth from Allah to warn a people who had not received a warner before, so they may be guided.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, for a wisdom He knows, and He is able to create them with a word "Be", and it would be. Then He ascended, Glory be to Him - meaning He rose high - over His Throne, an ascension befitting His Majesty, not to be qualified, nor likened to the ascension of created beings. You do not have - O people - any guardian who manages your affairs, or intercessor who intercedes for you with Allah, so that you may be saved from His punishment. Then, will you not take heed and ponder - O people - and single out Allah in worship and be sincere in your worship of Him?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created the heavens, the earth, and everything in between in six days and then established Himself on the Throne.  He is the only protector and intercessor; therefore, people should be mindful of Him.</p>

          <h2>Verse 24</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَجَعَلْنَا مِنْهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا لَمَّا صَبَرُوا ۖ وَكَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يُوقِنُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">We raised from among them leaders, guiding by Our command, when they patiently endured and firmly believed in Our signs.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We made from the Children of Israel guides and callers to good, whom people follow, and they call them to the Oneness and worship of Allah alone and obedience to Him. They only attained this high rank when they were patient with the commands of Allah, abandoning His prohibitions, calling to Him, and enduring harm in His cause, and they were certain of the verses and proofs of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah made leaders from among the Children of Israel who guided others by Allah's command, because they were patient, enduring, and believed firmly in His signs.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, your Lord - O Messenger - will judge between the believers and the disbelievers from the Children of Israel and others on the Day of Resurrection with justice in what they differed about in matters of religion, and will recompense each person according to his deeds by admitting the people of Paradise to Paradise and the people of Hell to Hell.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah will judge all people on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences, and each will be recompensed justly for their deeds.</p>

          <h2>Verse 26</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِي مَسَاكِنِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ ۖ أَفَلَا يَسْمَعُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Is it not yet clear to them how many peoples We destroyed before them, whose ruins they still pass by? Surely in this are signs. Will they not then listen?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Has it not become clear to these deniers of the Messenger: how many of the previous nations We have destroyed before them? They walk in their dwellings and see them clearly like the people of Hud, Salih, and Lot? Indeed, in that are signs and lessons that can be used to demonstrate the truthfulness of the messengers who came to them, and the falsehood of what they are upon of polytheism. Then will these deniers of the messengers not listen to the admonitions and proofs of Allah and benefit from them?</p>
          <p class="explanation">The ruins of past nations serve as signs, demonstrating the consequences of rejecting messengers and the truth. People should take heed and learn from the past.</p>

          <h2>Verse 27</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا نَسُوقُ الْمَاءَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ الْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعًا تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَامُهُمْ وَأَنْفُسُهُمْ ۖ أَفَلَا يُبْصِرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Do they not see how We drive rain to parched land, producing ˹various˺ crops from which they and their cattle eat? Will they not then see?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have not those who deny resurrection after death seen that We drive the water to the dry, hard land that has no vegetation, and We bring forth by it plants of various colors, from which their livestock eat and by which their bodies are nourished, so they live by it? Do they not see these blessings with their own eyes and realize that Allah who did that is able to revive the dead and bring them forth from their graves?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah provides for His creation by sending rain to dry land, which brings forth vegetation for people and animals to eat. This is a clear sign of Allah's power and provision.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">So turn away - O Messenger - from these polytheists and do not pay attention to their denial, and wait for what Allah will do with them. Indeed, they are waiting and watching for misfortunes to befall you, but Allah will disgrace and humiliate them, and give you victory over them. And He has done so, so to Him belongs praise and favor.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Prophet Muhammad is instructed to turn away from those who deny the message and wait for Allah's decree, as Allah will deal with them as they plan and wait to see misfortune befall believers.</p>
