          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَوْفُوا بِالْعُقُودِ ۚ أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الْأَنْعَامِ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ غَيْرَ مُحِلِّي الصَّيْدِ وَأَنْتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Honour your obligations. All grazing livestock has been made lawful to you—except what is hereby announced to you and hunting while on pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah commands what He wills.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, fulfill the confirmed covenants of Allah, from belief in the laws of religion, and submission to them, and fulfill the covenants to one another of trusts, transactions, and other matters that do not contradict the Book of Allah, and the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And Allah has made lawful for you the beast of cattle, which are camels, cows, and sheep, except what He has clarified to you of the prohibition of dead animals, blood, and other such things, and the prohibition of hunting while you are in the state of Ihram. Indeed, Allah judges what He wills in accordance with His wisdom and justice.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to fulfill their obligations and contracts. It declares that grazing livestock (camels, cows, and sheep) are lawful to eat, except what is specifically forbidden, such as hunting while on pilgrimage (Ihram). This highlights the importance of obeying Allah's commands and honoring commitments.</p>

          <h2>Verse 2</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُحِلُّوا شَعَائِرَ اللَّهِ وَلَا الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ وَلَا الْهَدْيَ وَلَا الْقَلَائِدَ وَلَا آمِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَانًا ۚ وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَادُوا ۚ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَنْ صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَنْ تَعْتَدُوا ۘ وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Do not violate Allah’s rituals ˹of pilgrimage˺, the sacred months, the sacrificial animals, the ˹offerings decorated with˺ garlands, nor those ˹pilgrims˺ on their way to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s bounty and pleasure. When pilgrimage has ended, you are allowed to hunt. Do not let the hatred of a people who once barred you from the Sacred Mosque provoke you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not violate the limits of Allah and His landmarks, and do not permit fighting in the sacred months, which are: Dhu al-Qa'dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. That was at the beginning of Islam, and do not violate the sanctity of the Hadi (sacrificial animal) or what is marked of it; as they would place collars, which were braids of wool or hair, on the necks as a sign that the animal was a Hadi and that the man intended to perform Hajj. And do not permit fighting those heading to the Sacred House who seek from the bounty of Allah that which will make their livelihood and please their Lord. And when you have ended your Ihram, then hunting is lawful for you. And let not hatred of a people for having prevented you from reaching the Sacred Mosque - as happened in the year of "Hudaybiyah" - incite you to abandon justice toward them. And cooperate - O believers among yourselves - in doing good deeds, and in the fear of Allah, and do not cooperate in what contains sin, disobedience and transgression of the limits of Allah, and beware of disobeying the command of Allah, for He is severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes respect for the rituals of pilgrimage, including the sacred months, sacrificial animals, and those traveling to the Sacred House. It warns against letting past conflicts incite injustice and promotes cooperation in righteousness and avoiding sin. This verse also highlights the gravity of disobeying Allah's commands.</p>

          <h2>Verse 3</h2>
          <p class="arabic">حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ وَالدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَا أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُوا بِالْأَزْلَامِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ الْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِ ۚ الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ فِي مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and swine; what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah; what is killed by strangling, beating, a fall, or by being gored to death; what is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it; and what is sacrificed on altars. You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions. This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me! Today I have perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and chosen Islam as your way. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger—not intending to sin—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has forbidden you dead animals, which are those animals that die without being ritually slaughtered, and He has forbidden you flowing blood that has been shed, the flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered in the name of other than Allah. Also forbidden are animals that have been strangled, which are those whose breath is constricted until they die; animals that have been beaten to death, which are those struck by a stick or stone until they die; animals that have fallen from a high place or into a well and died; and animals that have been gored by another animal and died. Allah has also forbidden you animals that have been eaten by wild beasts, such as lions, tigers, and wolves, and similar creatures. He, glory be to Him, has made an exception from the forbidden strangled animals and those mentioned after them that you are permitted to eat what you ritually slaughter before it dies. Allah has forbidden you what has been sacrificed to other than Allah on what is set up for worship, such as stones or other objects. Allah has forbidden you to seek knowledge of what has been allocated to you or not by arrows, which are the arrows they used to draw lots when they wanted to do something before they undertook it. That which is mentioned in the verse of forbidden things -if committed- is a departure from the command of Allah and His obedience to His disobedience. Now, the disbelievers have lost hope that you will turn away from your religion to polytheism, after I have given you victory over them, so do not fear them and fear Me. Today I have perfected for you your religion, Islam, by achieving victory and completing the Sharia, and I have completed My favor upon you by bringing you out of the darkness of ignorance into the light of faith, and I have approved Islam for you as a religion, so adhere to it and do not abandon it. But whoever is compelled by hunger to eat the dead, without being deliberately inclined to sin, then he is allowed to eat it, for Allah is Forgiving to him, Merciful to him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines dietary prohibitions, including carrion, blood, and swine. It also forbids animals slaughtered in the name of other than Allah, or killed by strangling, beating, falling, or goring, unless properly slaughtered before death. It also prohibits divination by lots. The verse emphasizes the completion of the faith and encourages fear of Allah, not disbelievers. It permits consuming forbidden things only in extreme hunger, without intending sin.</p>

          <p class="arabic">يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ ۖ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ ۙ وَمَا عَلَّمْتُمْ مِنَ الْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ فَكُلُوا مِمَّا أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They ask you, ˹O Prophet,˺ what is permissible for them ˹to eat˺. Say, “What is good and lawful. Also what is caught by your hunting animals and birds of prey which you have trained as instructed by Allah. So eat what they catch for you, but mention the Name of Allah over it ˹first˺.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Your companions ask you, O Prophet, what has been made lawful for them to eat. Say to them, “Lawful for you are the good things and what you have trained of birds and beasts of prey such as dogs, leopards, and falcons and the like, which are taught. You train them to hunt for you, taught to you by Allah. So, eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of Allah when you release them for hunting, and fear Allah in what He has commanded you to do and what He has forbidden you to do. Indeed, Allah is swift in account.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that lawful foods include those caught by trained hunting animals or birds. When releasing the trained animals to hunt, mentioning the name of Allah is necessary. The verse encourages mindfulness of Allah, emphasizing that He is swift in reckoning.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And from the perfection of Allah’s blessings upon you today, O believers, is that He has made lawful for you the good lawful things, and the sacrifices of Jews and Christians - if they sacrifice according to their law - are lawful for you, and your sacrifices are lawful for them. And lawful for you, O believers, is marriage to chaste free women who are believers, who are abstinent from fornication, and also marriage to chaste free women from among the Jews and Christians if you give them their dowries, and if you are chaste and not committing fornication, nor taking secret lovers, and you are safe from being influenced by their religion. And whoever denies the laws of faith, then his deeds are in vain, and he will be among the losers on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse declares that all good and pure foods are lawful. It also permits eating the food of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and marriage with chaste believing women, as well as chaste women from the People of the Book, as long as dowries are paid in wedlock, with no fornication or secret mistresses.

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity, then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands. It is not Allah’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer while you are in a state of impurity, then wash your faces and your hands to the elbows (and the elbow: the joint between the forearm and the upper arm) and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles (which are: the two prominent bones at the meeting point of the leg with the foot). And if you are in a state of major impurity, then purify yourselves by bathing from it before prayer. But if you are ill or on a journey while in good health, or one of you has relieved himself, or has had sexual intercourse with his wife, and you find no water, then strike with your hands the surface of the earth and wipe your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend in the matter of purification to make difficulty for you, but rather He has permitted dry ablution as a leniency upon you, and as a mercy to you, as He made it a substitute for water in purification, so the permission of dry ablution was from the completeness of the blessings which necessitate thanking the Bestower of blessings; by obeying Him in what He commanded and what He forbade.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the rules for ritual purification before prayer. It describes how to perform ablution (wudu) with water, washing specific body parts. If water is unavailable, dry ablution (tayammum) with clean earth is an alternative, showing Allah's ease and mercy.</p>

If you establish prayer and give the obligatory charity to those who deserve it, and believe in My messengers in what they have informed you, and support them, and spend in My cause, I will surely expiate your evil deeds from you, and I will surely admit you to gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow.

          <p class="quran-text">But for breaking their covenant, We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ˹O Prophet˺ will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So because of these Jews breaking their confirmed covenants, We expelled them from Our mercy, and We made their hearts hard, not softening to faith. They alter the words of Allah that He revealed to Moses, which is the Torah, and they abandoned a portion of what they were reminded of, so they did not act upon it. And you will continue - O Messenger - to find from the Jews betrayal and treachery, for they are on the path of their ancestors, except for a few of them. So pardon their ill-treatment of you, and forgive them, for Allah loves those who excel in forgiveness and pardon towards those who do wrong to them. (And thus the people of deviation find a way to their evil goals by distorting the words of Allah and interpreting them in a way that is not true, and if they are unable to distort and interpret them, they abandon what does not agree with their desires from the law of Allah, which only a few of those whom Allah has protected from them stand firm upon).</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that due to their breaking the covenant, the Children of Israel faced condemnation, hardening of hearts, and distortion of scriptures. It notes their deceitful nature and advises the Prophet to pardon and bear with them, as Allah loves those who do good.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We took their covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. So We let hostility and enmity arise between them until the Day of Judgment, and soon Allah will inform them of all they have done.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We took from those who claimed to be followers of the Messiah, Jesus - and they were not - the confirmed covenant that We took from the Children of Israel: that they should follow their messenger and support him and aid him. But they changed their religion and abandoned a portion of what they were reminded of, and did not act upon it, as the Jews did. So We cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will inform them of what they used to do on the Day of Account, and He will punish them for their deeds.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse speaks about Christians who made a covenant but neglected parts of it, leading to discord among themselves. Allah will hold them accountable for their actions.</p>

          <p class="arabic">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۚ قُلْ فَمَنْ يَمْلِكُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا إِنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ الْمَسِيحَ ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ۗ وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۚ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have fallen into disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has the power to prevent Allah if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and everyone in the world all together?” To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The Christians have disbelieved who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. Say - O Messenger - to these ignorant Christians: If the Messiah were a god as they claim, he would have been able to repel Allah's decree if it came to him to destroy him and his mother and all those on earth. And the mother of Jesus died, but he did not ward off death from her. Likewise, he is unable to ward it off from himself, because they are both servants from among the servants of Allah who are unable to ward off destruction from themselves. So, this is evidence that he is a human like all the children of Adam. And all that exists in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, He creates what He wills and brings it into existence, and He is capable of all things. So the reality of monotheism requires that Allah alone has the attributes of Lordship and Divinity, and none of His creation shares that with Him. And often people fall into polytheism and misguidance by being excessive in their love of prophets and righteous people, as the Christians were excessive in their love of the Messiah. The entire universe belongs to Allah, and creation is in His hand alone, and whatever appears of extraordinary things and signs is due to Allah. He creates what He wills and does what He wills.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse refutes the Christian claim that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. It argues that if Allah wanted, He could destroy them all, highlighting that Jesus was a mortal human and not God. The universe and its creation is solely in the hands of Allah, who is capable of all things.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The Jews and Christians claimed that they are the children of Allah and His beloved. Say to them - O Messenger -: Then why does He punish you for your sins? If you were His beloved, He would not punish you. For Allah only loves those who obey Him. And say to them: Rather, you are a creation like the rest of the children of Adam. If you do good, you will be rewarded for your good with good, and if you do evil, you will be rewarded for your evil with evil. Allah forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and He is the Owner of the Kingdom, He disposes of it as He wills, and to Him is the return, so He will judge between His servants, and reward each according to what he deserves.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the claims of Jews and Christians that they are God's chosen people. It refutes this by stating that God punishes people for their sins. It asserts that all humans are creations of God, and He has the power to forgive or punish as He wills. Ultimately, everything belongs to Him and everyone will return to Him.</p>

So, there is no excuse for you after his sending to you, for there has come to you from Allah a Messenger who gives glad tidings to those who believe in him and warns those who disobey him.

          <p class="arabic">فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ غُرَابًا يَبْحَثُ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُرِيَهُ كَيْفَ يُوَارِي سَوْءَةَ أَخِيهِ ۚ قَالَ يَا وَيْلَتَا أَعَجَزْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِثْلَ هَٰذَا الْغُرَابِ فَأُوَارِيَ سَوْءَةَ أَخِي ۖ فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ النَّادِمِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When Cain killed his brother, he did not know what to do with his body, so Allah sent a raven digging a hole in the ground to bury a dead raven, to show Cain how to bury his brother's corpse. So Cain was amazed and said: "Am I unable to do as this raven has done and cover my brother's nakedness?" So Cain buried his brother, and Allah punished him with remorse after he returned with loss.</p>
          <p class="explanation">God sends a crow to show Cain how to bury Abel's body. This act fills Cain with regret as he realizes his lack of even basic understanding.</p>

          <h2>Verse 32</h2>
          <p class="arabic">مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنْهُمْ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Because of this crime of murder, We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul for other than a cause of retaliation or corruption [done] in the land - by any type of corruption that warrants killing, such as polytheism or warring - it is as if he had killed all mankind. In what concerns the severe punishment from Allah, and whoever refrains from killing a soul which Allah has forbidden, it is as if he has given life to all mankind. So, preserving the sanctity of one human is preserving the sanctity of all people. And certainly, Our messengers came to the Children of Israel with clear proofs and evidences of the validity of what they called them to, of faith in their Lord, and performing what was ordained upon them, then many of them, after the coming of the messengers to them, were transgressors of the limits of Allah by committing the prohibitions of Allah and neglecting his commands.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the sanctity of human life. Taking one life unjustly is likened to killing all of humanity, while saving one life is like saving all of humanity. It also mentions that even with clear proofs, many transgressed.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and challenge Him with enmity, and transgress His judgments and the judgments of His Messenger, and cause corruption in the land by killing people and seizing wealth, is that they should be killed, or crucified along with the killing (and crucifixion is: that the perpetrator be tied to a piece of wood), or their right hand and left foot should be cut off. If he does not repent, his left hand and right foot should be cut off, or they should be exiled to a country other than their own and imprisoned in the prison of that country until their repentance becomes evident. And this penalty which Allah has prepared for the warriors is humiliation in the world, and in the Hereafter they will have a severe torment if they do not repent.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the penalties for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread corruption, which includes death, crucifixion, amputation, or exile. It also mentions a severe punishment in the Hereafter.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O Messenger, do not be grieved by those who hasten into disbelief of your prophethood from among the hypocrites who have shown Islam while their hearts are empty of it, for I will support you against them. And do not be grieved by the Jews' hastening to deny your prophethood, for they are people who listen to lies and accept what their rabbis fabricate, and they respond to other people who do not attend your assembly. And these others alter the words of Allah after they have understood them, and they say: "If what comes to you from Muhammad agrees with what we have altered and distorted from the rulings of the Torah, then act upon it, and if what comes to you from him contradicts it, then beware of accepting it and acting upon it." And whom Allah wills to misguide, you will never be able, [O Messenger], to repel that from him, nor can you guide him. And indeed, these hypocrites and Jews, Allah did not intend to purify their hearts from the filth of disbelief, for them is humiliation and disgrace in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse tells the Prophet not to be saddened by those who rush to disbelief, particularly hypocrites and Jews. It highlights the deceptive nature of those who distort the scripture and warns that those who are misguided by Allah will face disgrace in this world and severe punishment in the Hereafter.</p>

They come to you for judgment, O Messenger, while they do not believe in you, nor in your book, even though they have the Torah, in which is the judgment of Allah.

Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance from error and clarification of laws. The prophets—who submitted to the judgment of Allah and acknowledged it—judged by it among the Jews, and did not deviate from its judgment nor distort it. And the worshipers of the Jews and their scholars who educated people according to the law of Allah also judged by it. That is because their prophets entrusted them with conveying the Torah and understanding the book of Allah and acting by it, and the rabbis and scholars were witnesses that their prophets had judged the Jews by the book of Allah. And Allah says to the scholars and rabbis of the Jews: 'Do not fear the people in carrying out My judgment, for they are not capable of benefiting or harming you, but fear Me, for I am the Benefiter and the Harmer. And do not take in exchange for the judgment of what I have sent down a paltry price. Judging by other than what Allah has revealed is among the deeds of the people of disbelief. So, those who change the judgment of Allah which He revealed in His Book, and conceal it, deny it, and judge by other than it, believing it to be lawful and permissible, then those are the disbelievers.'</p>

So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it.

Had Allah willed, He would have made you one community, but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you about that in which you used to differ.</p>

Rather, He is open-handed, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred until the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah puts it out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And Allah does not like corruptors.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah informs His Prophet of some of the misdeeds of the Jews - and it was among what they were concealing among themselves - that they said: the hand of Allah is restrained from doing good, He has been stingy with us in sustenance and plenty, and that was when they were afflicted by drought and famine.  Their hands are shackled, i.e., their hands are restrained from doing good, and Allah expelled them from His mercy because of their saying. And it is not as they falsely claim about their Lord, rather His hands are outstretched, there is no restriction on Him, and no impediment preventing Him from spending, for He is the Generous, the Munificent, He spends according to wisdom and what is in the interest of His servants. And in the verse is affirmation of the attribute of the two hands for Allah, as befits Him without resemblance or description. But they will increase in transgression and disbelief because of their malice and envy; because Allah has chosen you with the Message. And Allah informs that groups of the Jews will continue until the Day of Resurrection to be hostile to one another and to repel one another, and every time they conspire to plot against the Muslims by stirring up discord and igniting the fire of war, Allah will foil their plot, and divide their unity.

The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.</p>

The one who has sworn an oath and not fulfilled it is given a choice between these three things. Whoever does not find any of that, then he must fast for three days. Those are the expiations for not fulfilling your oaths, and preserve, O Muslims, your oaths: by avoiding swearing, or fulfilling them if you swear, or expiating if you do not fulfill them. And as Allah has explained to you the ruling of oaths and their absolution, He explains to you the rulings of His religion so that you may be grateful to Him for guiding you to the straight path.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies the rules regarding oaths. Thoughtless oaths are not accountable, but deliberate oaths, if broken, require expiation through feeding the poor, clothing them, freeing a slave, or fasting if the other options are not feasible.

          <p class="arabic">مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ ۚ وَكُنْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا مَا دُمْتُ فِيهِمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيْتَنِي كُنْتَ أَنْتَ الرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَأَنْتَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: “Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!” And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me, You were the Witness over them—and You are a Witness over all things.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Jesus, peace be upon him, said, “O Lord, I did not say to them except what You commanded me, and ordered me to convey of Your singleness in oneness and worship. And I was, while among them, a witness over them and their actions and statements. But when You took me in fulfillment of my term on Earth and raised me to the heaven alive, You were the One aware of their secrets, and You are Witness over all things; nothing in the Earth or the Heaven is hidden from You.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">Jesus states that he only conveyed Allah's message to worship Him alone. He was a witness to them while he lived among them, but after his departure, Allah is the ultimate witness.</p>

          <h2>Verse 118</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِنْ تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ ۖ وَإِنْ تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">If You punish them, they belong to You after all. But if You forgive them, You are surely the Almighty, All-Wise.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, O Allah, if You punish them, then they are Your servants - and You are most knowing of their circumstances - You do with them what You will with Your justice. But if You forgive, with Your mercy, those of them who come with causes of forgiveness, then indeed, You are the All-Mighty, who cannot be overcome, the All-Wise in His planning and command. And this verse is praise of Allah, the Most High, for His wisdom, justice, and complete knowledge.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Jesus leaves the judgment of his followers to Allah's wisdom and mercy, acknowledging that they are His servants, and Allah is the All-Powerful and All-Wise.</p>

          <h2>Verse 119</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قَالَ اللَّهُ هَٰذَا يَوْمُ يَنْفَعُ الصَّادِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ ۚ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah will declare, “This is the Day when ˹only˺ the faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah the Most High said to Jesus, peace be upon him, on the Day of Resurrection: “This is the Day of recompense in which the monotheists will benefit from their belief in the Oneness of their Lord, their submission to His law, and their sincerity in their intentions, statements and actions. For them are gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and accepts their good deeds, and they are pleased with what He has given them of abundant reward. That reward and His pleasure with them is the great attainment.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah declares that the Day of Judgment is when the faithful will benefit from their faith. They will reside in gardens of Paradise eternally, and Allah will be pleased with them, and they will be pleased with Him.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">To Allah alone, without any partners, belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is within them, and He - glorified is He - is over all things capable, and nothing is beyond His power.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah asserts His absolute dominion over the heavens and the earth and all that is within them, highlighting His ultimate power and capability over everything.</p>
