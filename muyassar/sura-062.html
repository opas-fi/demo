          <p class="quran-text">The example of those who were entrusted with ˹observing˺ the Torah but failed to do so, is that of a donkey carrying books. How evil is the example of those who reject Allah’s signs! For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The likeness of those Jews who were charged with the Torah and then did not act upon it is like the likeness of a donkey carrying books that it does not know what is in them.
