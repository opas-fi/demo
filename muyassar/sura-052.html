Then Allah favored us with guidance and success, and protected us from the torment of the scorching Fire of Hell, which is its fire and heat. Indeed, we used to implore Him alone before, not associating any other with Him, that He would protect us from the torment of the scorching Fire and lead us to bliss. So He answered us and gave us what we asked for. Indeed, He is the Beneficent, the Merciful. So, from His benevolence and mercy towards us, He granted us His pleasure and Paradise, and protected us from His wrath and the Fire."</p>
