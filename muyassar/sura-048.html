          <p class="arabic">إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُبِينًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph ˹O Prophet˺</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, We have granted you, [O Prophet], a clear victory, through which Allah will make your religion apparent, grant you victory over your enemy. It is the truce of “Al-Hudaybiyah”, which made people feel safe with each other, thus expanding the circle of invitation to the religion of Allah. It enabled those who wish to know the truth of Islam to learn about it, and during that time, people entered the religion of Allah in crowds; and that is why Allah called it a clear victory, meaning an apparent and obvious one.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse refers to a clear victory granted to Prophet Muhammad, which is understood to be the truce of Hudaybiyah. This treaty paved the way for wider acceptance of Islam.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Surely those who pledge allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. Allah’s Hand is over theirs. Whoever breaks their pledge, it will only be to their own loss. And whoever fulfils their pledge to Allah, He will grant them a great reward.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you - O Prophet - at "Al-Hudaybiyah" for fighting are only pledging allegiance to Allah. They are making a covenant with Him seeking His Paradise and His pleasure. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. He is with them, hears their words, sees their place, and knows their hidden and apparent matters. So whoever breaks his pledge, then the harm of that returns to himself. And whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah of patience when meeting the enemy in the path of Allah and in support of His Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then Allah will give him a great reward which is Paradise. And in the verse is the establishment of the attribute of the Hand of Allah Almighty in a manner befitting Him, glory be to Him, without resemblance or modality.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet is essentially a pledge to Allah. Allah's support is with those who uphold their commitments, while those who break it harm themselves. Those who fulfill their pledge will receive a great reward from Allah.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, will say to you ˹O Prophet˺, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who then can stand between you and Allah in any way, if He intends harm or benefit for you? In fact, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who lagged behind from the Bedouins will say to you - O Prophet - when you reproach them for not going out with you to "Mecca": "Our wealth and our families kept us busy, so ask your Lord to forgive us for our lagging behind." They say that with their tongues, while it has no truth in their hearts. Say to them: "Then who can avail you anything against Allah if He intends for you harm or good?" It is not as these hypocrites thought that Allah does not know what is hidden in their inner selves of hypocrisy. Rather, He, glory be to Him, is ever aware of what they do; nothing of the actions of His creation is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the excuses of those who stayed behind from the Prophet's mission, claiming they were busy. It emphasizes that Allah knows what is in their hearts, and nothing can prevent Allah's will from affecting them. Allah is fully aware of their actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The truth is: you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families again. And that was made appealing in your hearts. You harboured evil thoughts ˹about Allah˺, and ˹so˺ became a doomed people.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the matter is not as you claimed, that you were busy with wealth and family. Rather, you thought that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and those of his companions with him, would perish and never return to you. Satan made that fair-seeming in your hearts. And you thought an evil thought that Allah would not grant victory to His Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions over their enemies, and you were a ruined people with no good in you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reveals the true reason for the actions of those who stayed behind, which is their doubt in the success of the Prophet and his companions. They had evil thoughts about Allah's plans and were destined for failure as a result.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">The ones who were left behind will say when you - O Prophet - and your companions set out for the spoils of "Khaybar" which Allah has promised you: "Let us go with you to 'Khaybar'." They intend thereby to change the promise of Allah to you. Say to them: "You will never go out with us to 'Khaybar' because Allah Almighty told us before our return to 'Medina' that the spoils of 'Khaybar' are for those who witnessed 'Al-Hudaybiyah' with us." Then they will say: "It is not as you say; Allah did not command you to do this. You are preventing us from going out with you out of envy from you, lest we obtain spoils with you.” And the matter is not as they claimed; rather, they understand little about Allah, what is for them, and what is against them of religious matters.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the excuses of those who stayed behind, wanting to join the believers for spoils of war. They are told they cannot join because Allah has already decided who will receive those spoils. Their excuse is driven by jealousy and a lack of understanding of divine matters.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">and many spoils of war they will gain. For Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Certainly, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, O Prophet, under the tree (and this is the Pledge of Good Pleasure in "Al-Hudaybiyah"). And Allah knew what was in the hearts of these believers of faith, truthfulness, and loyalty, so Allah sent down tranquility upon them and strengthened their hearts, and compensated them for what they missed with the treaty of "Al-Hudaybiyah" with an imminent victory, which is the conquest of "Khaybar," and many spoils that you will take from the wealth of the Jews of "Khaybar." And Allah is Mighty in His vengeance against His enemies, Wise in managing the affairs of His creation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The believers were also granted many spoils of war, and Allah is All-Powerful and Wise in His actions.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَعَدَكُمُ اللَّهُ مَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً تَأْخُذُونَهَا فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَٰذِهِ وَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَ النَّاسِ عَنْكُمْ وَلِتَكُونَ آيَةً لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah has promised you ˹believers˺ abundant spoils, which you will gain, so He hastened this ˹truce˺ for you. And He has held people’s hands back from ˹harming˺ you, so it may be a sign for the believers, and so He may guide you along the Straight Path.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has promised you abundant spoils that you will take in their appointed times which Allah has determined for you, and He has hastened for you the spoils of "Khaybar," and He restrained the hands of the people from you, so no harm befell you from what your enemies concealed for you of fighting and warfare, and from harming those you left behind you in "Medina," and so that their defeat, your safety, and your spoils should be a sign by which you take heed, and by which you know that Allah is your Protector and Supporter, and guides you to a straight path in which there is no crookedness. And Allah has promised you another spoil which you could not have conquered. Allah Almighty is Able over it and it is under His control and dominion. And He has promised it to you and what He has promised must come to pass. And Allah is over all things Powerful; nothing can make Him incapable. If the disbelievers of Quraysh fought you in "Mecca," they would have been defeated and turned their backs to you, as the defeated do in battle, and they would not have found for themselves besides Allah a protector to support them in fighting you, nor a helper to assist them in fighting you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah promised the believers many spoils, and He hastened the truce. He also protected them from harm so that they may see a sign and be guided to the Straight Path.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They are the ones who persisted in disbelief and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, preventing the sacrificial animals from reaching their destination. ˹We would have let you march through Mecca,˺ had there not been believing men and women, unknown to you. You might have trampled them underfoot, incurring guilt for ˹what you did to˺ them unknowingly. That was so Allah may admit into His mercy whoever He wills. Had those ˹unknown˺ believers stood apart, We would have certainly inflicted a painful punishment on the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The disbelievers of Quraysh are those who denied the Oneness of Allah, and they prevented you on the day of "Al-Hudaybiyah" from entering the Sacred Mosque, and they prevented the sacrificial animals and detained them from reaching their place of sacrifice, which is the sanctuary. And were it not for believing men and believing women who were weak among these disbelievers in "Mecca," concealing their faith for fear of themselves, whom you did not know; for fear that you would trample them with your army and kill them, and thus guilt, blame, and penalty would befall you without knowledge, We would have given you power over them so that Allah may admit whom He wills into His mercy and bestow upon them faith after disbelief, if these believing men and women had been distinguished from the polytheists of "Mecca" and had come out from among them, We would have punished those who disbelieved and denied among them with a painful, agonizing punishment.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">When those who disbelieved put in their hearts pride, the pride of [the time of] ignorance, so that they would not acknowledge the message of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and from that was their refusal to write in the peace treaty of "Al-Hudaybiyah", "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,” and they refused to write “This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed upon.” So Allah sent down tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers with him, and He obligated them to the word of “There is no god but Allah,” which is the head of all piety, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, and the believers with him were more entitled to the word of piety than the polytheists, and they were also the people of this word, not the polytheists. And Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing, nothing is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers' hearts were filled with ignorant pride, but Allah gave peace and tranquility to His Messenger and the believers, making them firm in their faith. The believers are more deserving of piety, and Allah knows everything.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm with the disbelievers and compassionate with one another. You see them bowing and prostrating ˹in prayer˺, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace of prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters—in this way Allah makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers. To those of them who believe and do good, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are firm against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating to Allah in their prayer, seeking from their Lord bounty, that He may admit them to Paradise and be pleased with them. Their mark of obedience to Allah is evident in their faces from the effect of prostration and worship. This is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is like that of a plant that brings forth its stalk and branches, then its branches multiply after that, and strengthen the plant, so it becomes strong and stands upright on its stems, beautiful in its appearance, pleasing to the farmers; so that He may enrage the disbelievers with these believers in their multitude and beauty of their appearance. And in this is evidence of the disbelief of whoever hates the Companions - may Allah be pleased with them - for whoever Allah enrages with the Companions, then there has been found in his case that which necessitates it, which is disbelief. And Allah has promised those who believed from among them in Allah and His Messenger and did what Allah commanded them, and avoided what He forbade them, forgiveness for their sins, and a great reward that will not cease, which is Paradise. (And the promise of Allah is true and confirmed, never broken, and everyone who follows the path of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, is in their ruling in deserving forgiveness and the great reward, and they have the virtue and precedence and perfection that no one of this nation can match them in, may Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased).</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the characteristics of Prophet Muhammad's companions: They are firm against disbelievers, compassionate among themselves, and devoted to prayer. Their devotion is evident in their appearance, reflecting their sincere worship. Their description is also found in previous scriptures. Their growth and strength, like a plant's, angers the disbelievers, while Allah promises forgiveness and a great reward for those who believe and do good.</p>
