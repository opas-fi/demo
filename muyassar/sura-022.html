          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَيْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the ˹violent˺ quaking at the Hour is surely a dreadful thing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O people, beware of the punishment of Allah by complying with His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. Indeed, what happens at the establishment of the Hour, from horrors and severe movement of the earth, from which all its sides are split, is something great, its value cannot be estimated, nor its essence reached, and no one knows its manner except the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse urges humanity to fear Allah, warning of the dreadful quaking and horrors that will occur on the Day of Judgment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The Day you see it, every nursing mother will abandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden ˹prematurely˺. And you will see people ˹as if they were˺ drunk, though they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is ˹terribly˺ severe.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">On the Day you see the establishment of the Hour, a mother will forget her nursing infant whom she has fed from her breast, because of the distress that has befallen her, and the pregnant woman will miscarry her load from terror, and the minds of people will be absent; they are like drunkards from the severity of the horror and panic, and they are not drunk from wine, but the severity of the torment has deprived them of their minds and their perception.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Judgment, the terror will be so immense that mothers will abandon their nursing infants, and pregnant women will miscarry, causing people to appear as if drunk due to the severity of the torment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺ We did create you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then a lump of flesh—fully formed or unformed—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to you. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O people, if you are in doubt that Allah gives life to the dead, then We created your father Adam from dust, then his offspring reproduced from a drop of sperm, which is the semen that a man throws into a woman's womb, then by the power of Allah it turns into a clot, which is the thick red blood, then into a lump of flesh, which is a small piece of flesh the size of what can be chewed, then it is sometimes formed, meaning fully formed, ending in the exit of the fetus alive, and sometimes not fully formed, so it falls prematurely; so that we may make clear to you the perfection of Our power by directing the stages of creation, and We keep in the wombs what We will, which is the formed one until the time of its birth, and the stages are completed by the birth of fetuses as small children who grow until they reach maturity, which is the time of youth and strength and the completion of the mind, and some children may die before that, and some grow up until they reach old age and weakness of mind; so this long-lived person does not know anything of what he used to know before that. And you see the earth dry and dead with no vegetation on it, but when We send down water upon it, it moves with vegetation, opening up, and it rises and increases from its watering, and it grows from every kind of beautiful plant that pleases the onlookers.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses doubts about the Resurrection by describing the stages of human creation from dust to a fully formed being. It highlights Allah's power through the development of the embryo, growth to maturity, and the revival of dead land through rain as signs of His ability to resurrect the dead.</p>

And He is the one who gives life to the dead, and He is capable of all things.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, Allah defends those who believe. Surely Allah does not like whoever is deceitful, ungrateful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, Allah Almighty defends the believers against the aggression of the disbelievers and the plots of the evil-doers, because He, the Mighty and Majestic, does not love every betrayer of his Lord's trust, and denier of His blessings.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹They are˺ those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled ˹the aggression of˺ some people by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who were forced to leave their homes, for no reason except that they embraced Islam and said: Our Lord is Allah alone. If it were not for what Allah has ordained of repelling injustice and falsehood by fighting, the truth would have been defeated in every nation and the earth would have been ruined, and places of worship would have been demolished, such as the hermitages of monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews, and the mosques of the Muslims in which they pray and mention the name of Allah much. And whoever strives to support the religion of Allah, then Allah will support him against his enemy. Indeed, Allah is strong, cannot be overcome, mighty and cannot be harmed, He has conquered all creatures and has taken them by their forelocks.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes those who were expelled from their homes for believing in Allah. It highlights that Allah's intervention prevents the destruction of places of worship and that He will support those who stand up for His cause.</p>

This tolerant religion is the religion of your father Abraham, and Allah has named you Muslims before, in the previous revealed books, and in this Quran. And He has distinguished you with this choice, so that the final messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, may be a witness over you that he conveyed the message of his Lord, and that you may be witnesses over the nations that their messengers conveyed to them what Allah has informed you of in His Book. So you must recognize the value of this blessing, and be grateful for it, and preserve the landmarks of the religion of Allah by performing prayer with its pillars and conditions, and giving the prescribed charity, and resort to Allah, glory be to Him, and rely on Him. For He is the best of protectors for those who take Him as a protector, and the best of helpers for those who seek His help.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse encourages believers to strive for Allah's cause, emphasizing the ease of the religion and its connection to Abraham. It highlights the role of Muslims as witnesses and emphasizes the importance of prayer, charity, and reliance on Allah, the ultimate protector and helper.</p>
