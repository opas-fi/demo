          <p class="muyassar">And the sending down of the Quran, and the clarification of its rulings, and its detailed explanation and perfection are so that you do not worship except Allah alone, without any partner. Indeed, I am to you - O people - from Allah, a warner warning you of His punishment, and a bearer of good tidings, giving you the good news of His reward.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The core message is to worship none but Allah, the One and Only God. The Prophet is a warner against Allah's punishment and a bearer of good news about His rewards.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And ask Him to forgive you your sins, then return to Him repentant. He will grant you good enjoyment in your world with a good life in it, until your appointed term comes, and He will give every person of merit from knowledge and actions the complete reward of his merit, with no deficiency in it. And if you turn away from what I call you to, then I fear for you the punishment of a severe day, which is the Day of Resurrection. And this is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the orders of Allah and denies His messengers.</p>

Do they not know that when they cover their bodies with their clothes, Allah is not unaware of their secret and open intentions? Indeed, He is Knowing of all that their chests harbor of intentions, thoughts, and secrets.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days—and His Throne was upon the waters—in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ say, “Surely you will ˹all˺ be raised up after death,” the disbelievers will certainly say, “That is nothing but pure magic!”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And it is He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, and His Throne was upon water before that, so that He may test you which of you is best in obedience to Him and in deeds, which is what is purely for Allah, conforming to what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was upon. And if you said - O Messenger - to these polytheists from your people: 'You are resurrected alive after your death,' they would hasten to deny it and say: 'This Quran that you recite to us is nothing but clear magic.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days to test humanity through their actions. The verse mentions that Allah's Throne was upon water before creation, emphasizing His ultimate power.

          <p class="quran-text">And if We delay their punishment until an appointed time, they will definitely say, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, on the Day it overtakes them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We delay the punishment from these polytheists until an appointed time, and they deem it slow, they will say in mockery and denial: 'What is preventing this punishment from falling, if it is true?'

And they will be surrounded from every side by the punishment for which they used to mock before it befell them.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And if We extend for man in his worldly life and make his provision abundant after a hardship of living, he will then say: 'The hardship has gone away from me, and the difficulties have ceased.' Indeed, he is boastful of blessings, excessive in pride and arrogance over people.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When people experience ease after hardship, they often forget their past difficulties and become proud and boastful. This demonstrates how worldly blessings can lead to arrogance and self-admiration.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">So perhaps you, O Messenger, due to the magnitude of the disbelief and denial you see from them, are abandoning some of what is revealed to you from what Allah has sent down to you and commanded you to convey, and your chest is constricted by it for fear that they might ask you for certain demands out of obstinacy, as if to say: 'Why was no great wealth sent down to him, or why did no angel come with him to confirm his message?' So convey to them what has been revealed to you, for you are only responsible for warning them with what has been revealed to you. And Allah is, over all things, a watchful guardian, managing all the affairs of His creation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse comforts the Prophet, advising him not to be disheartened by the disbelievers' demands for a treasure or an angel. It emphasizes that the Prophet's role is to deliver the message, and Allah manages all affairs.</p>

Say to them: If the matter is as you claim, then bring ten fabricated chapters like it, and call upon whomever you can from all of Allah's creation to help you bring these ten chapters, if you are truthful in your claim.</p>

Those believe in this Quran and act upon its rulings. And whoever disbelieves in this Quran from those who have allied against the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, his reward is the Fire, which he will inevitably enter. So, do not be - O Messenger - in doubt about the matter of the Quran and its being from Allah Almighty, after the evidence and proofs have testified to that. And know that this religion is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe and do not act upon what they have been commanded. And this is a general guidance for the nation of Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They will never frustrate Allah on earth, and they will have no protector besides Allah. Their punishment will be multiplied, for they failed to hear or see ˹the truth˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those disbelievers could not escape Allah in this world, and they will have no helpers to protect them from His punishment. The torment will be doubled for them in Hell, because they could not hear the Quran in a beneficial way, nor could they see the signs of Allah in this universe with guiding vision, because they were preoccupied with the disbelief they were persisting in.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Disbelievers will not escape Allah's power, nor will they have any protectors. Their punishment will be doubled because they rejected the truth, failing to listen and see.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Noah's son said, “I will take refuge on a mountain to protect myself from the water, and it will prevent me from drowning.” Noah replied, “There is no protection today from the command and decree of Allah that has descended upon creation from drowning and destruction, except for whom Allah has mercy upon, so believe and embark in the Ark with us.” And the high waves came between Noah and his son, and he was among those who were drowned and perished.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Noah's son refused to board the Ark, believing a mountain would protect him. Noah clarified that only Allah's mercy could save them. The waves separated them, and the son drowned.</p>
