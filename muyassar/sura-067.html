          <p class="muyassar">Say to them - O Messenger -: Allah is the One who brought you into being from nothing, and made for you hearing to hear with, and sight to see with, and hearts to understand with. Little - O disbelievers - do you give thanks for these blessings to your Lord who has bestowed them upon you. Say to them: Allah is the One who created you and dispersed you on the earth, and to Him alone you will be gathered after this dispersion for reckoning and recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is the One who dispersed you on earth, and to Him you will all be gathered.</p>

          <h2>Verse 25</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹Still˺ they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the disbelievers say: When will this promise of resurrection be fulfilled, O Muhammad? Tell us its time, O believers, if you are truthful in what you claim. Say - O Messenger - to these: Indeed, knowledge of the time of the Hour is specific to Allah, and I am only a warner for you, warning you of the consequence of your disbelief, and I am making clear to you what Allah has commanded me to make clear to the utmost extent.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers ask when the threat will come. The timing of that is with Allah, and the Prophet is sent with a clear warning.</p>

          <h2>Verse 27</h2>
          <p class="arabic">فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيئَتْ وُجُوهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَقِيلَ هَٰذَا الَّذِي كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Then when they see the torment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and it will be said ˹to them˺, “This is what you claimed would never come.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When the disbelievers saw Allah's punishment approaching them and witnessed it, humiliation and gloom appeared on their faces, and it was said to them in rebuke: “This is what you used to seek to hasten in the world.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the disbelievers' dismay when they witness the approaching punishment they once denied. Their faces will be filled with gloom and they will be rebuked for their disbelief.</p>

          <h2>Verse 28</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَهْلَكَنِيَ اللَّهُ وَمَنْ مَعِيَ أَوْ رَحِمَنَا فَمَنْ يُجِيرُ الْكَافِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say, [O Messenger], to these disbelievers: “Inform me, if Allah causes me to die and those with me of the believers as you wish, or if He has mercy on us and delays our end and keeps us safe from His punishment, then who is it that will protect you and prevent you from a painful, agonizing punishment?”</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet is instructed to ask the disbelievers who will protect them from punishment if Allah chooses to cause him and the believers to die or if He has mercy on them instead. This highlights that only Allah has power over life and death and only He can prevent punishment.</p>

          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes the believers’ faith and trust in Allah, the Most Compassionate. It challenges the disbelievers to recognize who is truly astray, warning them of the consequences of their disbelief.</p>

          <p class="explanation">This verse poses a rhetorical question, asking who else besides Allah could restore their water if it were to vanish. It is intended to highlight Allah’s control over natural resources and the dependence of humans on His power.</p>
