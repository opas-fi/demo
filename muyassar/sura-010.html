          <p class="quran-text">Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">(Alif, Lam, Ra). The discussion about the disjointed letters at the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah has preceded.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse begins with the letters *Alif-Lam-Ra*, which are among the disjointed letters that appear at the start of some surahs. This verse asserts that the Quran is a book full of wisdom.</p>

          <p class="arabic">أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنْذِرِ النَّاسَ وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ ۗ قَالَ الْكَافِرُونَ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ مُبِينٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, ˹instructing him,˺ “Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the disbelievers said, “Indeed, this ˹man˺ is clearly a magician!”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Was it a wonder to the people that We revealed the Quran to a man from among them, to warn them of the punishment of Allah, and to give glad tidings to those who believe in Allah and His messengers that they will have a good reward for what they have put forth of righteous deeds? But when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came to them with the revelation of Allah and recited it to them, those who denied said: Indeed, Muhammad is a magician, and what he has brought is obvious magic that is invalid.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that Allah sent a messenger to warn people and give glad tidings to believers. The disbelievers, however, called the messenger a magician.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair. None can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺. Will you not then be mindful?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He ascended - meaning He rose and elevated - over the Throne in a manner befitting His majesty and greatness. He manages the affairs of His creation; no one opposes Him in His decree, and no intercessor can intercede with Him on the Day of Resurrection except after He permits them to intercede. So worship Allah, your Lord, who is described with these attributes, and dedicate your worship to Him alone. Will you not then take heed and learn from these signs and proofs?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself on the Throne. He manages all affairs and only He permits intercession. This verse emphasizes Allah's Oneness and calls for worship.</p>

Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">To your Lord is your return, all of you, on the Day of Resurrection, and this is the true promise of Allah. He is the One who begins the creation and then brings it back after death, bringing it to life as it was initially, to reward those who believed Allah and His Messenger, and did good deeds with the best of rewards in justice. And those who denied the oneness of Allah and the message of His Messenger will have a drink of intensely hot water that scalds faces and cuts intestines, and they will have a painful punishment because of their disbelief and misguidance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">All will return to Allah on the Day of Resurrection. He originates creation and will resurrect it. Believers will be justly rewarded while disbelievers will face severe punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when harm touches man, he calls upon Us to remove it, lying on his side or sitting or standing, according to the condition he is in when that harm befalls him. But when We remove from him the harm that touched him, he continues on his previous path before the harm afflicted him, and forgets what he was in of hardship and affliction, and abandons gratitude to his Lord who relieved him of what had befallen him of affliction. Just as it has been made fair-seeming to this man his persistence in his denial and obstinacy after Allah relieved him of his harm, it has been made fair-seeming to those who have transgressed in lying about Allah and His prophets what they used to do of disobedience to Allah and associating partners with Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When people face hardship, they turn to Allah, but when relieved, they often forget and return to their old ways.  This shows how misdeeds become appealing to them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَيَقُولُونَ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۖ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَا الْغَيْبُ لِلَّهِ فَانْتَظِرُوا إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الْمُنْتَظِرِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹The knowledge of˺ the unseen is with Allah alone. So wait! I too am waiting with you.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And these stubborn disbelievers say, “Why has not an evidence and sign been sent down to Muhammad from his Lord, by which we may know that he is upon the truth in what he says?” Say to them, [O Prophet], “No one knows the unseen except Allah. So if He wills, He will do it, and if He wills, He will not do it. So wait, O people, for the judgment of Allah between us and you by hastening His punishment for the wrongdoer among us and victory for the one who is upon the truth. I am waiting for that.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">Disbelievers ask for a sign from Allah. The Prophet responds that knowledge of the unseen belongs to Allah alone, urging them to wait for Allah's judgment and making it clear that the Prophet is also waiting.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَإِذَا أَذَقْنَا النَّاسَ رَحْمَةً مِنْ بَعْدِ ضَرَّاءَ مَسَّتْهُمْ إِذَا لَهُمْ مَكْرٌ فِي آيَاتِنَا ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ أَسْرَعُ مَكْرًا ۚ إِنَّ رُسُلَنَا يَكْتُبُونَ مَا تَمْكُرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-angels record whatever you devise.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when We let the polytheists taste ease, relief, and prosperity after hardship, severity, and distress had afflicted them, they immediately deny and mock the verses of Allah. Say, [O Messenger], to these mocking polytheists: Allah is swifter in planning, and in drawing you on gradually, and in punishing you. Indeed, Our keepers whom We send to you write down what you are plotting against Our verses, then We will hold you accountable for that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights how people, upon receiving blessings after hardship, often plot against God's messages. It warns that God's plan is far swifter and His messengers record all actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so happens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the passengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and those on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they assume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is He who causes you to travel, [O people], on land upon beasts and other [vehicles], and at sea in ships, until when you are in them and they sail with a good wind, and the passengers of the ships rejoice in the good wind, there comes to these ships a strong wind, and the passengers are overtaken by waves [which is what rises from the water] from every place, and they become certain that destruction has encompassed them, they sincerely supplicate to Allah alone, and abandon what they used to worship, and they say: If You save us from this distress we are in, we will surely be among the grateful to You for Your favors.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes God's power over land and sea, depicting a scenario where people on a ship, facing a storm, sincerely call upon God for salvation. This illustrates human vulnerability and dependence on God.</p>

Your transgression is only against your own souls. ˹There is only˺ brief enjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will inform you of what you used to do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">But when Allah saves them from adversities and terrors, they immediately commit corruption and disobedience in the land. O people, the consequence of your transgression only returns upon yourselves.

          <p class="explanation">Despite being saved, people often return to transgression. The verse reminds them that their actions only harm themselves and worldly pleasures are fleeting, as all will return to God for accountability.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The example of worldly life and what you boast about in it of adornment and wealth is only like rain which We send down from the sky to the earth, and various kinds of plants grow because of it, mixed together, from which people eat of the fruits, and what animals eat of the vegetation, until when the beauty and splendor of this earth appears, and the people of this earth think that they are able to harvest it and benefit from it, Our command and decree comes upon it, destroying what is on it of plants and adornment, either at night or during the day, and We make these plants and trees harvested and cut down, with nothing left in them, as if those crops and plants had not been standing on the face of the earth before that. So likewise comes the end to what you are boastful of in your world and its finery; Allah causes it to perish and destroys it. And as We have explained to you, O people, the example of this world and made you aware of its reality, We explain Our proofs and evidence for a people who contemplate the verses of Allah, and consider what benefits them in this life and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The life of this world is compared to rain that brings forth vegetation, which then withers. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of worldly life, and the need to reflect on God's signs.</p>

These are the people of the Fire, abiding therein forever.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Or do they claim, “He made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or do they say: Muhammad has fabricated this Quran from himself? They know that he is a human like them! Say to them, [O Messenger]: Then bring you a single surah like this Quran in its structure and guidance, and seek help for that from everyone you can besides Allah from humans and jinn, if you are truthful in your claim.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse challenges those who accuse Prophet Muhammad of fabricating the Quran. It calls them to produce even a single chapter like it, seeking help from whomever they wish besides Allah, to prove their claim.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Rather, they hastened to deny the Quran as soon as they heard it, before they pondered its verses, and they disbelieved in that which they had not encompassed in knowledge, like the mention of the Resurrection, recompense, Paradise, and Hellfire, and other things, and the reality of what they were promised in the Book has not yet come to them. And just as the polytheists denied the promise of Allah, the nations that passed before them also denied. So look, [O Messenger], how was the consequence of the wrongdoers? Allah destroyed some of them by causing the earth to swallow them, some by drowning, and some by other means.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes how the disbelievers rejected the Quran without understanding it. It serves as a reminder that those who reject truth often suffer similar fates as the wrongdoers before them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَمَا ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">What do those who fabricate lies against Allah expect on Judgment Day? Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most of them are ungrateful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And what do those who fabricate lies against Allah think on the Day of Account, adding to Him the prohibition of what He has not prohibited for them of sustenance and provisions, that Allah will do with them on the Day of Resurrection because of their lies and fabrication against Him? Do they think that He will forgive them? Indeed, Allah is full of bounty towards His creation by leaving the one who fabricates lies against Him without immediate punishment in this world, and granting him respite. But most people do not thank Allah for His favor upon them in that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who fabricate lies against Allah will face the consequences on Judgment Day. Allah is bountiful to humanity but many are ungrateful.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! If you are in doubt of my faith, then ˹know that˺ I do not worship those ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Allah. But I worship Allah, Who has the power to cause your death. And I have been commanded, ‘Be one of the believers,’</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say, O Messenger, to these people: If you are in doubt about the validity of my religion to which I have called you, which is Islam, and of my steadfastness and uprightness upon it, and you hope for my turning away from it, then I do not worship under any circumstances any of those whom you worship from what you have taken of idols and false deities, but I worship Allah alone, who causes you to die and takes your souls, and I have been commanded to be among those who affirm Him, acting according to His law.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet (peace be upon him) declares that he only worships Allah, the One who gives life and takes it away. He rejects the idols of the disbelievers, affirming his commitment to monotheism.</p>

          <h2>Verse 105</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and, ‘Be steadfast in faith in all uprightness, and do not be one of the polytheists,’</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And that you, O Messenger, establish yourself upon the religion of Islam, being steadfast upon it, not inclining away from it to Judaism nor Christianity nor the worship of other than Him. And do not be of those who associate in the worship of their Lord, partners and rivals, so you would be of the destroyed ones. And this, even though it is addressed to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire nation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is commanded to be steadfast in his faith and to avoid polytheism. This directive applies to all Muslims, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the purity of faith.</p>

          <h2>Verse 106</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَا تَدْعُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ ۖ فَإِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and ‘Do not invoke, instead of Allah, what can neither benefit nor harm you—for if you do, then you will certainly be one of the wrongdoers,’</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not invoke, O Messenger, besides Allah anything of idols and false deities, because they neither benefit nor harm. For if you did that and invoked them besides Allah, then you would be of those who associate partners with Allah, doing injustice to themselves by shirk and disobedience. And this, even though it is addressed to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire nation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse prohibits invoking anything besides Allah because only Allah can provide benefit or harm. It warns against associating partners with Allah (shirk), which is a grave injustice.</p>

          <h2>Verse 107</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلَا كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ وَإِنْ يُرِدْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَلَا رَادَّ لِفَضْلِهِ ۚ يُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and ‘If Allah touches you with harm, none can undo it except Him. And if He intends good for you, none can withhold His bounty. He grants it to whoever He wills of His servants. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if Allah afflicts you - O Messenger - with hardship or a calamity, there is no remover of it except Him, Glory and Exalted is He. And if He intends for you ease or a blessing, no one can withhold it from you. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, afflicts with ease and hardship whomever He wills of His servants, and He is the Forgiving of the sins of whoever repents, the Merciful to whoever believes in Him and obeys Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights Allah's absolute power. If He brings harm, only He can remove it; if He intends good, no one can prevent it. Allah is the All-Forgiving and Most Merciful to those who repent and believe.</p>

          <h2>Verse 108</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا ۖ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! The truth has surely come to you from your Lord. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say - O Messenger - to these people: The Messenger of Allah has come to you with the Quran, which contains the explanation of your guidance. So, whoever is guided by the guidance of Allah, then the fruit of his action returns to him. And whoever deviates from the truth and insists on misguidance, then his misguidance and harm are upon himself. And I am not entrusted with you to make you believers. I am only a Messenger, delivering what I have been sent with.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Prophet Muhammad is told to declare that the truth has come from Allah. Whoever follows guidance does so for their own benefit, and whoever strays does so to their own detriment. The Prophet is a messenger, not a keeper of people's faith.</p>
