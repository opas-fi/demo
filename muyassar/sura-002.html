          <p class="arabic">الم</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These letters and other disjointed letters at the beginning of the surahs are an indication of the miraculous nature of the Quran; it was used to challenge the polytheists, who were unable to oppose it, even though it is composed of the same letters that make up the Arabic language. The Arabs' inability to produce something like it - even though they are the most eloquent of people - proves that the Quran is a revelation from Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">These disjointed letters at the beginning of the surah are a challenge to those who doubted the Quran's divine origin. It shows that despite using the same Arabic letters, no one could produce something similar to the Quran.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">That Quran is the great book, about which there is no doubt that it is from Allah. So, no one should have any doubts about it because it is clear.

          <p class="quran-text">who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And they are the ones who believe in the unseen, which cannot be perceived by their senses or their minds alone; because it can only be known through the revelation of Allah to His messengers, such as the belief in angels, Paradise, Hellfire, and other things that Allah has informed about, or that His Messenger has informed about. (And faith: a comprehensive word for acknowledging Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and destiny, both good and bad, and confirming that acknowledgement with words, actions, and in the heart, tongue, and limbs).  And along with their belief in the unseen, they are diligent in performing prayer at its appointed times, correctly according to what Allah prescribed for His prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and from what We have provided them with of wealth, they give the obligatory and recommended charity of their wealth.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The righteous are those who believe in the unseen, such as angels and the afterlife, establish prayer properly, and give charity from what Allah has provided them.</p>

And they believe in the abode of life after death and what it contains of reckoning and recompense, a belief in their hearts which manifests on their tongues and limbs. And the Last Day is specifically mentioned because belief in it is one of the greatest motivators for performing acts of obedience, avoiding prohibitions, and holding oneself accountable.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The righteous also believe in the Quran and the revelations before it, including previous scriptures. They have firm faith in the Hereafter, which motivates them to do good and avoid evil.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, those who have denied what was revealed to you from your Lord out of arrogance and transgression, faith will not occur from them, whether you warn them and caution them against the punishment of Allah, or you leave that; because of their insistence on their falsehood.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes those who stubbornly reject faith. Whether they are warned or not, they will not believe due to their arrogance and persistence in disbelief.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and has placed a cover over their sight; because of their disbelief and defiance after the truth became clear to them, so they were not guided to the right path, and for them is a severe punishment in the Fire of Hell.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah has sealed their hearts and hearing, and veiled their sight, as a result of their deliberate rejection of the truth. This leads to severe punishment.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">They believe in their ignorance that they deceive Allah and those who have believed by showing belief and concealing disbelief, but they only deceive themselves; because the consequence of their deception returns upon them.

So Allah responded to them that foolishness is exclusive to them, and they do not know that what they are in is misguidance and loss.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Their example is that of someone who kindles a fire, but when it lights up all around them, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in complete darkness—unable to see.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The state of the hypocrites who believed - outwardly, not inwardly - in the message of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then disbelieved, and thus began to stumble in the darkness of their misguidance while they are unaware, with no hope of escaping from it, resembles the state of a group in a dark night, where one of them lit a great fire for warmth and illumination. When the fire blazed and illuminated its surroundings, it went out and became dark, so its companions were in darkness, unable to see anything, nor finding a path or way out.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the hypocrites who initially embraced the truth but then rejected it. They are likened to people who light a fire that illuminates their surroundings, only for the light to be taken away, leaving them in complete darkness, unable to see or find their way.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers ˹by His might˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or the state resembles another group of hypocrites, to whom the truth appears sometimes, and they doubt it at other times, like a group walking in the open, when a heavy rain falls upon them, accompanied by layers of darkness, with the crashing thunder, the flashing lightning, and the scorching thunderbolts, which make them, out of intense horror, place their fingers in their ears for fear of destruction. And Allah Almighty encompasses the disbelievers; they cannot escape Him nor render Him helpless.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse presents another analogy for the unstable state of the hypocrites. They are like people caught in a violent storm, with darkness, thunder, and lightning causing them immense fear and uncertainty. They try to avoid the truth because they are afraid of facing consequences.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">It is as if the lightning were about to snatch away their sight. Whenever lightning strikes, they walk in its light, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and sight. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The lightning - from its intense brilliance - almost snatches away their sight, yet whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in its light, and when it is gone, the path becomes dark for them, and they stop in their places. Were it not for Allah's respite for them, He would have taken away their hearing and sight, and He is able to do that at any time. Indeed, He is over all things competent.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The lightning in the storm is described as almost taking away their sight. When the lightning flashes, they walk, but when darkness returns, they stop, representing the hypocrites' wavering faith. It also signifies Allah's power to take away their senses anytime.</p>

As for the believers, they know the wisdom of Allah in using the small and large of His creation as examples. As for the disbelievers, they scoff and say: What does Allah mean by setting an example with these insignificant insects? Allah answers them that the purpose is to test and distinguish the believer from the disbeliever. Therefore, Allah misguides many people from the truth by this example because of their mockery, and guides others to more faith and guidance. And Allah Almighty does not wrong anyone, because He does not turn away from the truth except those who disobey Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah uses parables, even of small things like a mosquito, to teach. Believers understand these as truth from Allah, while disbelievers question their meaning. Through these parables, Allah guides some and lets others stray based on their own choices and rebelliousness.</p>

Moses said – disapproving of them –: Do you seek these foods that are of less value, and leave this beneficial provision that Allah has chosen for you? Go down from this wilderness to any city, you will find much of what you desire in the fields and markets. And when they went down, it became clear to them that they prioritize their choice – in every instance – over Allah's choice, and they prefer their desires over what Allah has chosen for them; therefore, they were afflicted with humiliation and poverty of souls, and they went back with anger from Allah; because of their turning away from the religion of Allah, and because they used to disbelieve in the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly and transgressively; and that was due to their disobedience and exceeding the limits of their Lord.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you. Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Yet, you are those who kill one another and expel a group of you from their homes, supporting one another against each other with sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives in the hands of the enemy, you hasten to ransom them, even though it was forbidden for you to expel them from their homes. How evil is what you do when you believe in part of the Torah and disbelieve in part! The recompense for those who do this among you is nothing but disgrace in this worldly life. And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will return them to the most severe punishment in the Fire. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Despite their covenant, the Children of Israel violated it by killing and expelling each other. They even ransomed their captured brethren while simultaneously engaging in aggression, displaying selective adherence to their scriptures and facing disgrace in this life and severe punishment in the Hereafter.

But when the Messenger came to them, whose attributes and truthfulness they knew, they disbelieved in him and called him a liar. So the curse of Allah is upon everyone who disbelieves in the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his book that Allah revealed to him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse criticizes those who, despite previously seeking the Prophet's arrival for victory, rejected him and the Quran when they came. This rejection, despite recognizing its truth, invites Allah's condemnation.</p>

So they returned with wrath from Allah upon them because of their denial of the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after His wrath upon them because of their distortion of the Torah. And for those who deny the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is a humiliating and disgraceful punishment.</p>

So you said, 'We have heard your word and disobeyed your command,' because the worship of the calf had mixed with your hearts due to your persistence in disbelief.

          <h2>Verse 102</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ ۖ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ ۖ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ ۚ وَمَا هُمْ بِضَارِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنْفَعُهُمْ ۚ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon. The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not abandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺ between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the Jews followed what the devils gave out in the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and thus disbelieving in Allah. And the Jews also followed the magic that was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon, Iraq, as a test and trial from Allah for His servants. The two angels would not teach anyone until they advised them and warned them against learning magic, saying: 'Do not disbelieve by learning magic and obeying the devils.' So people would learn from the two angels that which they could use to cause hatred between husband and wife until they separated. And the magicians cannot harm anyone except by the permission and decree of Allah. And the magicians learn only evil that harms them and does not benefit them, and the devils have transmitted it to the Jews, so it became widespread among them until they preferred it over the Book of Allah. And the Jews have known that whoever chooses magic and abandons the truth has no share of good in the Hereafter. And evil is that for which they have sold themselves with magic and disbelief in exchange for faith and following the Messenger, if only they had knowledge that yields action based on what they were admonished with.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse discusses how some people followed magic taught by devils instead of the divine guidance of Solomon. The devils, not Solomon, disbelieved by teaching magic. It highlights a test through two angels, Harut and Marut, who warned against magic. Despite warnings, people learned magic that could cause harm, even between spouses, but only with Allah's permission. Ultimately, choosing magic leads to loss in the Hereafter.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed, do not say to the Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: 'Ra'ina,' which means: 'Give ear to us,' so understand from us and make us understand; because the Jews used to say it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, twisting their tongues with it, intending to insult him and attribute him to foolishness. Rather, say - O believers - instead of that: 'Unzurna,' meaning 'look at us and take care of us,' which conveys the same desired meaning, and listen to what is recited to you from the Book of your Lord and understand it. And for the disbelievers is a painful torment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse directs believers to use respectful language when addressing the Prophet. Instead of using "Ra'ina" which could be twisted, they are told to use "Unzurna". It also highlights the importance of attentively listening to the divine message and warns of a painful punishment for disbelievers.</p>

And Allah is never unaware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or do you say, arguing about Allah: That Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes - who are the prophets who were in the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel from the descendants of Jacob - were upon the religion of Judaism or Christianity? And this is a lie; for they were sent and died before the Torah and the Gospel were revealed. Say to them - O Messenger -: Are you more knowledgeable about their religion or Allah the Almighty? And He has informed in the Quran that they were monotheists and Muslims. And there is no one more unjust than you when you conceal a testimony that is established with you from Allah the Almighty, and claim the opposite, fabricating lies about Allah. And Allah is not unaware of any of your actions, but He is the One who enumerates them and will recompense you for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse questions the claim that Abraham and his descendants were Jews or Christians, clarifying that they lived before Judaism and Christianity. It accuses those who hide the truth they received from Allah of wrongdoing and reminds that Allah is aware of their actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your ˹previous acts of˺ faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And as We have guided you - O Muslims - to the correct path in religion, We have made you a chosen and just nation, so that you may be witnesses over the nations on the Day of Judgment that their messengers delivered the messages of their Lord, and the Messenger will be a witness over you on the Day of Judgment that he delivered the message of his Lord to you. And We did not make - O Messenger - the qiblah of "Bayt al-Maqdis" which you were on, then We turned you away from it to the Kaaba in "Mecca", except to make manifest what We knew in eternity; knowledge related to reward and punishment, to distinguish who follows and obeys you and faces with you wherever you turn, and who is weak in faith, thus turning back, an apostate from his religion due to his doubt and hypocrisy. And indeed, this matter, which is the turning of the Muslim in his prayer from facing Bayt al-Maqdis to facing the Kaaba, is indeed heavy and difficult, except for those whom Allah has guided and favored with faith and piety. And Allah would not waste your faith in Him and your following of His Messenger, and invalidate your prayers towards the previous qiblah. Indeed, He is, glory be to Him, Most Kind and Merciful to people.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Muslims are described as a just and balanced community, chosen to be witnesses for humanity. The change of the Qibla was a test to distinguish the true believers from those who were weak in faith. Allah's grace and mercy are highlighted.</p>

And wherever you are - O Muslims - and you want to pray, then turn towards the Sacred Mosque. And those whom Allah has given knowledge of the Book, from the Jews and Christians, certainly know that your turning to the Kaaba is the truth established in their books. And Allah is not unaware of what these objectors and doubters do, and He will recompense them for that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse confirms that the Prophet's (peace be upon him) desire for the Qibla to be changed to the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba) in Mecca was fulfilled by Allah.

And if you were to follow their desires regarding the qiblah and other matters after what has come to you of knowledge that you are on the truth and they are on falsehood, then at that time, you would surely be among the wrongdoers to themselves. And this is an address to the entire nation, and it is a threat and a warning to whoever follows the desires of those who oppose the Sharia of Islam.</p>

And indeed, those who differed about the Book, believing in some of it and disbelieving in some of it, are in a dispute and a departure far from righteousness and truth.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The reason for the severe punishment is that Allah revealed the truth through His books, and those who dispute or disbelieve in parts of it are far astray from the truth.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, ˹needy˺ travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in ˹the heat of˺ battle. It is they who are true ˹in faith˺, and it is they who are mindful ˹of Allah˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Righteousness in the sight of Allah - the Most High - is not in turning one's face in prayer toward the east or the west, unless it is according to the command and law of Allah. Rather, true righteousness lies in the faith of one who believes in Allah, affirming Him as the sole deity with no partner, and believes in the Day of Resurrection and Judgment, and in all the angels, and in all the revealed books, and in all the prophets without distinction, and gives wealth – despite his love for it – to relatives, and needy orphans whose fathers died before reaching puberty, and the poor who are burdened by poverty, and needy travelers who are far from their families and wealth, and the beggars who are forced to beg due to their dire need, and spends in freeing slaves and captives, and establishes prayer, and pays the obligatory Zakat, and those who fulfill their covenants, and those who are patient in times of poverty, sickness, and during intense fighting. Those who are described with these attributes are the ones who are truthful in their faith, and those are the ones who have feared the punishment of Allah and avoided His disobedience.</p>
          <p class="explanation">True righteousness is not merely about rituals; it's about faith in Allah, the Last Day, angels, scriptures, and prophets. It involves giving to the needy, performing prayers, paying charity, keeping promises, and being patient in hardship. These are the attributes of the truthful and God-conscious believers.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! ˹The law of˺ retaliation is set for you in cases of murder—a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, Allah has prescribed for you legal retribution for the intentional killing: the killer is to be killed, under the condition of equality and likeness: a free person is killed for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But whoever is forgiven by the heir of the murdered person by foregoing retaliation and accepting the blood money – which is a specific amount of money that the offender pays in exchange for being forgiven – then both parties must adhere to good conduct; the heir should demand the blood money without violence, and the killer should pay him his due with kindness, without delay or reduction. Such forgiveness with accepting blood money is a relief and mercy from your Lord for you, due to the ease and benefit it provides. But whoever kills the killer after forgiveness and receiving the blood money, then he will have a painful punishment, either by being killed in retaliation in this world, or in the Fire in the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the law of retaliation in cases of murder, where a life is taken for a life. However, it also allows for forgiveness and the acceptance of blood money. This is presented as a mercy from Allah, but transgressing these limits incurs severe punishment.</p>

Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them.

So now, have relations with them and seek what Allah has destined for you of children. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black thread of night at the appearance of true dawn. Then complete the fast until night by abstaining from the things that break it until sunset. And do not have relations with your wives or do anything that leads to relations if you are observing I'tikaf in the mosques, because this invalidates the I'tikaf (which is staying in the mosque for a specified period with the intention of drawing closer to Allah). These are the ordinances that Allah has prescribed for you, which are His limits distinguishing between the lawful and the unlawful, so do not approach them lest you fall into the unlawful.

          <h2>Verse 191</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ ۚ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِنْدَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ ۖ فَإِنْ قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الْكَافِرِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is the reward of the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And kill them wherever you find them, and expel them from the place from which they expelled you, which is "Mecca." And persecution - which is disbelief, polytheism, and turning away from Islam - is worse than killing them. And do not begin fighting them at the Sacred Mosque, in reverence for its sanctity, until they begin fighting you there. But if they fight you at the Sacred Mosque, then kill them there. Such is the recompense for the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse permits fighting back against those who attack, and to expel them from places they drove Muslims from. It emphasizes that persecution is worse than fighting, and fighting is allowed in the Sacred Mosque if initiated by the enemy.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">But if they cease from their disbelief and fighting you at the Sacred Mosque, and enter into faith, then Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the enemies cease their aggression and fighting, Allah is forgiving and merciful. This highlights that the purpose of fighting is to stop persecution and not for revenge.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Fight against them ˹if they persecute you˺ until there is no more persecution, and ˹your˺ devotion will be to Allah ˹alone˺. If they stop ˹persecuting you˺, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And continue - O believers - fighting the polytheists who are aggressing, until there is no more persecution of Muslims from their religion and no polytheism with Allah, and the religion remains for Allah alone, purely, with none else worshipped beside Him. But if they cease from disbelief and fighting, then cease from fighting them; for punishment is only for those who persist in their disbelief and aggression.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Fight against those who persecute until religious freedom is established and worship is for Allah alone. If they stop fighting, there should be no aggression except against the aggressors. This establishes the principle of fighting only when necessary.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹There will be retaliation in˺ a sacred month for ˹an offence in˺ a sacred month, and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone attacks you, retaliate in the same manner. ˹But˺ be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Your fighting, O believers, against the polytheists in the month in which Allah has forbidden fighting is a recompense for their fighting you in the Sacred Month. And whoever transgresses against what Allah has forbidden of place and time will be punished with the like of his action, and of the same kind of deed. So whoever has transgressed against you by fighting or other means, then inflict upon him a similar punishment to his crime, and there is no blame upon you for that; because they are the ones who began the aggression, and fear Allah and do not exceed the likeness in punishment, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him and obey Him by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Fighting in a sacred month is allowed if the enemy attacks first. Retaliation should be proportional to the transgression.  Always be mindful of Allah and that He is with those who fear Him.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Complete the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage for Allah. But if prevented ˹from proceeding˺, then ˹offer˺ whatever sacrificial animals you can afford. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its destination. But if any of you is ill or has a scalp ailment ˹requiring shaving˺, then compensate either by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering. In times of peace, you may combine the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage then make the sacrificial offering you can afford. Whoever cannot afford that ˹offering˺, let them fast three days during pilgrimage and seven after returning ˹home˺—completing ten. These offerings are for those who do not live near the Sacred House. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And complete the Hajj and Umrah for the sake of Allah. But if you are prevented from going to complete them after entering into their sacred state by a hindrance such as an enemy or illness, then it is obligatory upon you to slaughter what is available for you of camels, cows, or sheep as an offering to Allah; in order to exit your sacred state by shaving or shortening the hair of the head. And do not shave your heads if you are prevented until the one who is prevented sacrifices his offering in the place where he is prevented, then releases from his sacred state, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) sacrificed in "Al-Hudaybiyah" then shaved his head, and the one who is not prevented does not sacrifice the offering except in the Sanctuary, which is its place on the day of Eid, the tenth day and what follows of the days of Tashreeq. And whoever among you is sick, or has an ailment of the head which requires him to shave - while he is in a state of Ihram (sacred state) - may shave, and he must then offer expiation: either by fasting three days, or by feeding six poor people, giving each poor person half a Sa' of food, or by sacrificing a sheep for the poor of the Sanctuary. So if you are in safety and health, then whoever enjoys Umrah until Hajj, and that is by making lawful what was forbidden to him because of the Ihram after the completion of his Umrah, must sacrifice what is available of an offering; but if he cannot find an offering to sacrifice, then he must fast three days in the months of Hajj and seven when you have finished the actions of the Hajj and returned to your families, that is ten full days, and they must be fasted. That offering and what is ordained of fasting for it, is for one whose family is not among the residents of the sacred territory. And fear Allah, and maintain the fulfillment of His commands and the avoidance of His prohibitions, and know that Allah is severe in punishment to the one who opposes His commands and commits what He has forbidden.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Complete the pilgrimage (Hajj) and minor pilgrimage (Umrah) for Allah's sake. If prevented, offer a sacrifice. Those who cannot make a sacrifice must fast. This verse explains the rules and requirements for these acts of worship.</p>

Whoever commits to ˹performing˺ pilgrimage, let them stay away from intimate relations, foul language, and arguments during pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, Allah ˹fully˺ knows of it. Take ˹necessary˺ provisions ˹for the journey˺—surely the best provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O people of reason!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The time of Hajj is during well-known months, which are: Shawwal, Dhul-Qadah, and ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. So whoever makes Hajj obligatory upon himself in them by entering into Ihram, then intercourse and its verbal and physical preliminaries are forbidden for him, and it is forbidden for him to disobey Allah the Almighty by committing sins, and arguing during Hajj that leads to anger and hatred. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it, and will reward each one for his deeds. And take for yourselves provision of food and drink for the Hajj journey, and provision of righteous deeds for the Hereafter, for indeed the best provision is the fear of Allah, and fear Me, O people of sound intellect.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Pilgrimage (Hajj) is to be performed during specific months. During this time, pilgrims must abstain from intimacy, bad language, and arguments. Allah is aware of all good deeds, and the best provision is righteousness. The verse also urges people of reason to be mindful of God.</p>

And whoever delays by staying in "Mina" until he stones the Jamarat on the thirteenth day, there is no sin upon him, for whoever fears Allah in his pilgrimage. And delaying is better; because it is an increase in worship and an emulation of the Prophet's actions, peace be upon him. And fear Allah - O Muslims - and observe Him in all your deeds, and know that to Him alone you will be gathered after your death for reckoning and recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to remember Allah during the days of Tashreeq (11th-13th of Dhul-Hijjah).

And none differed regarding the matter of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and his book, out of injustice and envy, except those to whom Allah gave the Torah, and who knew what it contained of proofs and laws, so Allah enabled the believers by His grace to distinguish truth from falsehood, and to know what they differed about.

And the polytheism that you are in is greater and more severe than killing in the sacred month. And these disbelievers have not been deterred from their crimes, but they are continuing in them, and they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from Islam to disbelief if they can achieve that. And whoever among you - O Muslims - obeys them and apostatizes from his religion and dies in disbelief, then his work in this world and the hereafter has gone, and he has become one of those who are confined to the fire of Hell, never to leave it.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْمَحِيضِ ۖ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَاعْتَزِلُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ ۖ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ التَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about menstruation. Say, “Beware of its harm! So keep away, and do not have intercourse with your wives during their monthly cycles until they are purified. When they purify themselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by Allah. Surely Allah loves those who always turn to Him in repentance and those who purify themselves.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And they ask you about menstruation - which is the blood that flows from the wombs of women naturally at specific times. Say to them, [O Prophet], “It is a harmful impurity that harms those who approach it, so abstain from marital relations with women during menstruation until the bleeding stops. Then, when the bleeding has stopped and they have purified themselves, then have relations with them in the place that Allah has permitted for you, which is the vagina, not the anus. Indeed, Allah loves His servants who are abundant in seeking forgiveness and repentance, and He loves His servants who purify themselves, those who stay away from immoralities and impurities.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains the rules regarding menstruation, stating that marital relations should be avoided during this time due to impurity. It emphasizes purity and seeking forgiveness, as these are beloved to Allah.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Your wives are a place of cultivation for you, you place the sperm in their wombs, and from it comes the children by the will of Allah, so have relations with them in the place of intercourse only, which is the vagina, in whatever manner you wish, and put forth for yourselves righteous deeds by observing the commands of Allah, and fear Allah, and know that you will meet Him for accountability on the Day of Judgment. And give good tidings to the believers, [O Prophet], of what pleases and gladdens them from good recompense in the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse uses the analogy of wives as farmland, indicating that relations are permissible, but within proper boundaries. It also urges righteous actions and reminds believers of their accountability to Allah and the good tidings for believers.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Divorced women who menstruate must wait without marriage after the divorce for a period of three purifications or three menstrual cycles as a waiting period; to ensure that the womb is clear of pregnancy. And it is not permissible for them to marry another man during this waiting period until it is over. And it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, of pregnancy or menstruation, if the divorced women are truly believers in Allah and the Last Day. And the husbands of the divorced women have more right to take them back during the waiting period. And that should be with the intention of reconciliation and good, not with the intention of harm, torturing them by prolonging the waiting period. And for women are rights over men, similar to those of men, in a known manner, and for men over women is an added degree of good companionship and association with kindness, and guardianship of the house and ownership of divorce.

          <p class="quran-text">Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace. It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah. So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Divorce which allows for reconciliation is twice, one after the other. The rule of Allah after each divorce is to keep the woman with kindness, and good companionship after taking her back, or to release her with good treatment by giving her her rights, and that her ex-husband should not mention her with evil. And it is not permissible for you - O husbands - to take anything of what you have given them of the dowry and the like, unless the spouses fear that they will not uphold the marital rights, then they present their matter to the guardians, and if the guardians fear that the spouses will not uphold the limits of Allah, then there is no blame on the spouses for what the woman pays to the husband in return for her divorce. Those are the limits of Allah that separate between the lawful and unlawful, so do not transgress them, and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, then those are the wrongdoers to themselves by exposing themselves to the punishment of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Divorce can be retracted twice. After that, husbands must keep their wives with honor or separate with kindness. Husbands cannot take back dowry unless they fear not upholding marital limits. If so, the wife can compensate for divorce. These are Allah's limits; do not transgress them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">لَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُوا لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً ۚ وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعًا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۖ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">There is no blame if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated or the dowry is settled. But give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation—the rich according to his means and the poor according to his. A reasonable compensation is an obligation on the good-doers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">There is no blame upon you - O husbands - if you divorce women after the contract has been made, but before you have consummated the marriage or specified a dowry for them. Provide for them something beneficial, to compensate them, ward off the distress of divorce, and remove grudges. This provision is obligatory according to the circumstances of the divorcing man: the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his ability; provision in the manner known by law. And it is a right established upon those who do good to the divorced women and to themselves by obeying Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse states that there is no blame in divorcing a woman before consummation or settling the dowry. However, it emphasizes that a fair compensation should be given to the divorced women. The compensation should be according to the means of the husband, and it is an obligation upon the good-doers.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَإِنْ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلَّا أَنْ يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ النِّكَاحِ ۚ وَأَنْ تَعْفُوا أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ ۚ وَلَا تَنْسَوُا الْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And if you divorce them before consummating the marriage but after deciding on a dowry, pay half of the dowry, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays in full. Graciousness is closer to righteousness. And do not forget kindness among yourselves. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if you divorce women after the contract has been made, but you have not consummated the marriage, but you have obligated yourselves to a specified dowry for them, then you must give them half of the agreed upon dowry, unless the divorced women forgo it and relinquish half of the dowry due to them, or the husband allows the divorced woman to keep the entire dowry. And your forbearance, O men and women, is closer to the fear of Allah and obedience to Him. And do not forget - O people - the favor and kindness between you, which is giving what is not obligatory upon you, and being lenient in rights. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of what you do, He encourages you towards good and urges you towards virtue.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If a divorce occurs before consummation but after the dowry is settled, half of the dowry should be given to the divorced woman.  However, the wife can choose to waive her right to it or the husband can generously pay the full dowry.  Kindness and leniency in all dealings are encouraged, as Allah sees all actions.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And if you fear an enemy, then pray the prayer of fear while walking or riding, in any way you can, even by gesturing, or facing a direction other than the Qiblah. Then when your fear is gone, perform the prayer of security, and remember Allah in it, and do not diminish it from its original form, and give thanks to Him for what He has taught you of matters of worship and rulings that you did not know.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse allows for flexibility in prayer during times of danger, permitting prayer on foot or while riding. However, when safe, Muslims are obligated to remember Allah and perform prayers correctly as taught.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And the spouses who die and leave behind wives, it is incumbent upon them to make a will for them: that they be provided with maintenance for a full year from the day of death, with residence in the husband's house without the heirs evicting them for the duration of the year, as a consolation to the wife and as righteousness to the deceased. If the wives leave of their own accord before the end of the year, then there is no blame upon you -O heirs- in that, nor is there any blame on the wives for what they do for themselves of permissible matters. And Allah is Mighty in His dominion, Wise in His command and prohibition. And this verse is abrogated by His statement, may He be exalted: (And those of you who die and leave behind wives, they should wait concerning themselves four months and ten days).</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the rights of widows, instructing that they should be provided for a year after their husband's death. However, this instruction is understood to be abrogated by a subsequent verse and is no longer in effect. The verse emphasizes the importance of fair treatment of widows.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Did you not know -O Messenger- the story of those who fled from their lands and homes, and they were many thousands, fearing death from the plague or fighting? So Allah said to them: Die, so they died all at once as a punishment for their fleeing from the decree of Allah. Then Allah brought them back to life after a period, to fulfill their appointed terms and to take heed and repent? Indeed, Allah is the Possessor of great bounty over the people with His many blessings, but most of the people do not give thanks for the bounty of Allah upon them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse tells the story of people who fled their homes to avoid death, and Allah caused them to die and then brought them back to life. This story highlights Allah's power and the importance of gratitude.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Did you not know - O Messenger - the story of the nobles and dignitaries of the Children of Israel after the time of Moses? When they asked their prophet to appoint a king over them, under whose leadership they could unite and fight their enemies in the way of Allah. Their prophet said to them: Is it as I expect, that if fighting in the way of Allah is ordained for you, you will not fight? For I expect your cowardice and flight from battle. They said, rejecting their prophet's expectation: And what prevents us from fighting in the way of Allah, when our enemy has driven us out of our homes and separated us from our children by killing and captivity? But when Allah ordained fighting for them with the king He appointed for them, they became cowardly and fled from battle, except for a few of them who stood firm by the grace of Allah. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers who break their covenants.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse recounts how the Children of Israel, after Moses, asked their prophet for a king to lead them in battle.

Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And their prophet said to them: Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king in response to your request, to lead you in fighting your enemy as you requested. The leaders of the Children of Israel said: How can Saul be a king over us, when he does not deserve it? For he is not from the tribe of kings, nor from the house of prophethood, and he has not been given much wealth to use in his kingdom. So we are more deserving of the kingdom than him, because we are from the tribe of kings and from the house of prophethood. Their prophet said to them: Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you, and He is Most Knowing of the affairs of His servants, and He has increased him in knowledge and physical strength to fight the enemy. And Allah is the Owner of the kingdom; He gives His kingdom to whom He wills of His servants, and Allah is vast in bounty and bestowal, Knowing of the realities of things; nothing is hidden from Him.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And their prophet said to them: Indeed, the sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you, in which is the Torah - and their enemies had seized it from them - within it is tranquility from your Lord, which strengthens the hearts of the sincere, and within it is a remnant of some things left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, such as the staff and fragments of the tablets, which the angels will carry.

          <p class="quran-text">When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When Saul went out with his troops to fight the Amalekites, he said to them: Allah is testing your patience with a river in front of you that you will cross, in order to distinguish the believer from the hypocrite. Whoever drinks from the water of the river is not of me, and is not fit to fight with me. And whoever does not taste the water, then he is of me, because he is obedient to my command and fit for jihad, except for the one who takes a single handful with his hand, then there is no blame on him. When they reached the river, they fell upon the water, and overindulged in drinking from it, except for a few of them who endured thirst and heat, and sufficed with a handful of their hand. At that point, the disobedient were left behind. When Saul crossed the river with the few believers who were with him - and they were three hundred and some men - to meet the enemy, and they saw the large number of their enemy and their equipment, they said: We have no power today against Goliath and his mighty soldiers. Then those who were certain of meeting Allah, reminding their brothers of Allah and His power, said: How many small groups of patient believers have overcome, by the permission and command of Allah, a large group of disbelieving and rebellious people. And Allah is with the patient by granting them success, victory, and a good reward.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Saul tested his army with a river, distinguishing the obedient from the disobedient. A small group remained steadfast, showing that victory comes from faith and reliance on Allah, not just numbers. This verse highlights that small, steadfast groups can overcome large forces by the will of Allah.</p>

          <p class="explanation">By the Will of Allah, they defeated their enemies; David killed Goliath. Allah granted David kingship and wisdom. This verse illustrates Allah's way of preventing corruption by balancing powers. It highlights Allah's favor and support for believers.</p>

          <p class="arabic">تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۘ مِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ ۗ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَٰكِنِ اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ كَفَرَ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">We have chosen some of those messengers above others. Allah spoke directly to some, and raised some high in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought ˹among themselves˺ after receiving the clear proofs. But they differed—some believed while others disbelieved. Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These noble messengers, Allah favored some of them over others, according to what Allah bestowed upon them: among them are those whom Allah spoke to, like Moses and Muhammad, peace be upon them. And in this is confirmation of the attribute of speech for Allah, the Almighty, in a manner befitting His Majesty. And among them are those whom Allah raised to high ranks, like Muhammad, peace be upon him, due to the universality of his message, the sealing of prophethood with him, and the preference of his nation over all nations, and other things. And Allah the Most High gave Jesus, the son of Mary, peace be upon him, clear miraculous signs, like curing the one born blind by Allah's permission, and the one afflicted with leprosy by Allah's permission, and giving life to the dead by Allah's permission, and He supported him with Gabriel, peace be upon him. If Allah had willed, those who came after these messengers would not have fought after the clear signs had come to them, but they differed among themselves: some of them remained steadfast in their faith, and some of them persisted in their disbelief. If Allah had willed after the disagreement occurred among them, which led to fighting, they would not have fought, but Allah guides whom He wills to His obedience and faith in Him, and He forsakes whom He wills, so he disobeys Him and disbelieves in Him. He does what He wills and chooses.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that Allah favored some messengers over others, granting them different distinctions. Some, like Moses, received direct communication, while others, like Muhammad, were elevated in status. Jesus was given miracles and supported by the Holy Spirit. Despite clear proofs, people differed, with some believing and some disbelieving. Allah's will ultimately prevails in all matters.</p>

He said: I give life and death, that is, I kill whom I want to kill and keep whom I want to keep alive. So Abraham said to him: Indeed, Allah, whom I worship, brings the sun from the east, so can you change this divine law by making it come from the west?

Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity.

He said: I have remained a day or part of a day, so he informed him that he remained dead for a hundred years, and commanded him to look at his food and drink, and how Allah preserved them from changing for this long period, and commanded him to look at his donkey how Allah revived it after it was scattered bones? And he said to him: We will make you a sign for the people, that is: a clear indication of Allah’s ability to resurrect after death, and ordered him to look at the bones how Allah raises some of them above others, and joins some with others, then covers them with flesh after joining, and then restores life to them?

          <p class="arabic">وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِنْ لَمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain, is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah and with firm conviction in the truth of His promise, is like a great garden on high, good land, upon which heavy rain falls, and its fruits are doubled. And if heavy rain does not fall upon it, then the drizzle is sufficient to give the doubled fruit. Likewise, the expenses of the sincere are accepted by Allah and multiplied, whether they are little or much. For Allah is aware of the secrets, the Seeing of the apparent and the hidden, and He rewards each according to his sincerity.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse compares sincere charity to a fruitful garden on fertile land. Whether it receives heavy rain or a drizzle, it yields abundant produce, showing that even small acts of charity, when done sincerely for Allah, are multiplied in reward. Allah sees all actions and intentions.</p>

          <p class="arabic">أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَاءُ فَأَصَابَهَا إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَاحْتَرَقَتْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Would any of you wish to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines, with rivers flowing beneath its trees, and have all kinds of fruits in it, and he has reached old age and cannot plant such a planting, and he has young children in need of this garden. And in this state, a fierce wind, with scorching fire, blows upon it and burns it. Such is the state of those who are not sincere in their spending. They will come on the Day of Resurrection with no good deeds. And with such an explanation, Allah makes clear to you what benefits you, so that you may reflect and make your spending sincere for Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse presents a parable of a prosperous garden destroyed by fire, representing the state of insincere charity. It highlights the loss that comes from not being sincere, likening it to a person who loses their hard work just when they need it the most. It encourages reflection on the intention behind charitable acts.</p>

So how do you accept for Allah what you do not accept for yourselves? And know that Allah, who has provided for you, is free of need of your charity, worthy of praise, and praiseworthy in every condition.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse urges believers to donate from the best of their wealth, rather than giving what is worthless. It reminds them that Allah is Self-Sufficient and worthy of praise, emphasizing sincerity and generosity in giving.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Those who consume interest will stand ˹on Judgment Day˺ like those driven to madness by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, “Trade is no different than interest.” But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who deal with usury - which is the increase on the principal - will not rise in the Hereafter from their graves except like the one whom Satan confuses with madness; that is because they said: Indeed, selling is like usury, in that both are permissible and lead to an increase in wealth. But Allah has denied them and clarified that He has made selling lawful and prohibited usury because of the benefit in buying and selling for individuals and groups, and because of the exploitation, loss, and destruction in usury. So whoever receives a prohibition from Allah regarding usury and refrains, then he is entitled to what passed before the prohibition reached him, and there is no sin upon him in that. And his matter is with Allah in what remains of his time. If he continues in his repentance, then Allah does not waste the reward of the good-doers. And whoever returns to usury and does it after the prohibition from Allah reached him, then he has deserved the punishment and the proof has been established against him. That is why He, the Exalted, said: "Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the severe state of those who consume interest, comparing them to those driven mad by Satan. It emphasizes that Allah has forbidden interest while allowing trade, and warns of eternal punishment in Hell for those who persist in dealing with interest.</p>

          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا تَدَايَنْتُمْ بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى فَاكْتُبُوهُ ۚ وَلْيَكْتُبْ بَيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ ۚ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا ۚ فَإِنْ كَانَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا أَوْ ضَعِيفًا أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِالْعَدْلِ ۚ وَاسْتَشْهِدُوا شَهِيدَيْنِ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَامْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّنْ تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَاءِ أَنْ تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الْأُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَاءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُوا ۚ وَلَا تَسْأَمُوا أَنْ تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَىٰ أَجَلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَادَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰ أَلَّا تَرْتَابُوا ۖ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلَّا تَكْتُبُوهَا ۗ وَأَشْهِدُوا إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ ۚ وَلَا يُضَارَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلَا شَهِيدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ تَفْعَلُوا فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ ۗ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. This is for the preservation of wealth and the prevention of disputes. And let a trustworthy and capable man write it, and let not the one whom Allah has taught writing refuse to do so. And let the debtor dictate what he owes, and let him fear his Lord, and not reduce anything from his debt. And if the debtor is incompetent because of his extravagance and wastefulness, or is a minor, or insane, or unable to speak because of muteness, or lacks full ability to speak, then let the one who is in charge of the debtor dictate, and seek the testimony of two Muslim men who are of age and sound mind and of good character. And if two men are not found, then seek the testimony of a man and two women from whom you are satisfied with their testimony, so that if one of them forgets, the other may remind her. And the witnesses should respond when they are called upon to bear witness, and they should perform it when they are called to it, and do not be weary of writing it, whether it be small or large, for its specified time. That is more just in the law of Allah and His guidance, and a greater aid to establishing testimony and fulfilling it, and closer to removing doubt about the kind of debt, its amount and its term. But if the issue is a matter of buying and selling, taking a commodity and paying its price on the spot, then there is no need to write it down, and it is recommended to have witnesses to prevent conflict and division. And it is obligatory for the witness and the scribe to bear witness truthfully and to write as Allah commanded. And it is not permissible for the owner of the right and the one who owes the right to harm the scribes and the witnesses, and likewise it is not permissible for the scribes and the witnesses to harm those who need their writing or testimony, and if you do what you are forbidden from, then that is disobedience to Allah, and its consequence will befall you. And fear Allah in all that He has commanded you with and forbade you from, and Allah will teach you all that will benefit you in this world and the hereafter. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything, nothing of your affairs is hidden from Him, and He will recompense you for it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes the importance of documenting financial transactions, particularly loans, to ensure fairness and prevent disputes. It outlines the procedures for writing contracts, including choosing a just scribe, having the debtor dictate the terms, and obtaining reliable witnesses (two men or one man and two women). It also advises against harming the scribe or witnesses and stresses the importance of being mindful of Allah in all dealings, as He is the source of all knowledge.</p>

          <h2>Verse 283</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُوا كَاتِبًا فَرِهَانٌ مَقْبُوضَةٌ ۖ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِي اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ ۗ وَلَا تَكْتُمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ ۚ وَمَنْ يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security, but˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them fear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if you are traveling and cannot find a scribe, then let a pledge be taken as security. And if you trust one another, then there is no blame upon you if you do not write or have witnesses, and the debt remains a trust upon the debtor, who must fulfill it. He must be mindful of Allah and not betray his companion. And if the debtor denies what he owes, and there was someone who attended and witnessed, then he must declare his testimony. And whoever conceals this testimony, then he has a treacherous and wicked heart. And Allah is aware of the secrets, His knowledge encompasses all your affairs, and He will hold you accountable for that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses financial transactions during travel, advising on taking security if a scribe is unavailable. It stresses honoring trusts and the importance of truthful testimony. Concealing testimony is a grave sin, and Allah is aware of all actions.</p>

          <h2>Verse 284</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَإِنْ تُبْدُوا مَا فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ اللَّهُ ۖ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Whether you reveal what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is within them, in ownership, management, and encompassing knowledge; nothing is hidden from Him. And whether you disclose what is within your selves or conceal it, then Allah knows it. And He will hold you accountable for it, then forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills. And Allah is powerful over all things. And Allah honored the Muslims after that and forgave for thoughts and whispers of the heart as long as it was not followed by speech or action, as that has been confirmed from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute ownership and knowledge of all creation. Whether thoughts or actions are revealed or concealed, Allah will hold everyone accountable. However, He has the power to forgive or punish as He wills, highlighting His complete control.</p>

          <h2>Verse 285</h2>
          <p class="arabic">آمَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۚ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْ رُسُلِهِ ۚ وَقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. ˹They proclaim,˺ “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. ˹We seek˺ Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You ˹alone˺ is the final return.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, believed and was certain of what was revealed to him from his Lord, and it is his right to be certain. And the believers also believed and acted upon the Great Quran. Each of them believed in Allah as Lord and God, described with attributes of majesty and perfection, and that Allah has honored angels, and that He sent down books, and sent messengers to His creation. We - the believers - do not believe in some of them and deny others; rather, we believe in them all. And the Messenger and the believers said: 'We have heard, our Lord, what You have revealed, and we obey in all of that. We hope that You will forgive - by Your grace - our sins, for You are the One who nurtured us with what You have bestowed upon us, and to You - alone - is our return and destiny.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse affirms the faith of the Prophet Muhammad and the believers in Allah, His angels, scriptures, and messengers, without distinction. It reflects the believers' submission to Allah's commands and their seeking of His forgiveness, recognizing that all will return to Him.</p>

          <h2>Verse 286</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِنْ نَسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ ۖ وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا ۚ أَنْتَ مَوْلَانَا فَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The religion of Allah is easy, with no hardship in it, so Allah does not ask of His servants what they cannot bear. Whoever does good will attain good, and whoever does evil will attain evil. Our Lord, do not punish us if we forget something of what You have obligated upon us, or if we err in doing something that You have forbidden us from doing. Our Lord, do not place upon us a burden of difficult deeds as You placed upon those before us from the disobedient as a punishment for them. Our Lord, do not impose on us what we cannot bear of obligations and calamities, and erase our sins, and conceal our faults, and be gracious to us. You are the Owner of our affairs and its manager, so grant us victory over those who deny Your religion and deny Your Oneness, and who disbelieved Your Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and make the outcome for us over them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse states that Allah does not burden anyone beyond their capacity. It also includes a prayer asking for forgiveness for mistakes, not to be burdened like those before, and for help in overcoming challenges. Allah is acknowledged as the ultimate guardian and source of victory.</p>
