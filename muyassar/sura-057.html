And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion, bodies playing and hearts being amused, and adornment with which you beautify yourselves, and boasting among yourselves in its possessions, and rivalry in increase of wealth and children. Its likeness is that of rain whose growth pleases the tillers, then it dries up, and you see it turn yellow after its greenness, then it becomes broken pieces of straw. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment for the disbelievers and forgiveness from Allah and acceptance for the people of faith. And the life of this world for those who work for it, forgetting their hereafter, is only the enjoyment of delusion.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The worldly life is described as temporary and filled with distractions like amusement, boasting, and competition. It's like a plant that grows, then withers. The Hereafter will bring either severe punishment or forgiveness, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the eternal life rather than being consumed by worldly pleasures.</p>
