          <h2>Verse 1</h2>

          <p class="quran-text">In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.Surah Al-Fatiha. This Surah is called Al-Fatiha (The Opening) because the Holy Quran is opened with it. It is also called Al-Mathani because it is recited in every Rak'ah (unit of prayer). It has other names as well. I begin reciting the Quran in the name of Allah, seeking His help. (Allah) is a proper noun for the Lord - Blessed and Exalted - the One who is rightfully worshipped without any other, and it is the most specific name of Allah Almighty, and none other is called by it, Glory be to Him. (Ar-Rahman) the Possessor of general mercy whose mercy encompasses all of creation, (Ar-Rahim) towards the believers, and these are two names from His Almighty names, which include the establishment of the attribute of mercy for Allah Almighty as befits His Majesty.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse begins the Quran by invoking the name of Allah, emphasizing His attributes *Ar-Rahman* (The Most Compassionate), denoting His universal mercy, and *Ar-Rahim* (The Most Merciful), signifying His particular mercy for the believers.</p>

          <p class="arabic">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">He, Glory be to Him, is the sole Owner of the Day of Judgment, and it is the day of recompense for deeds. And in the Muslim's recitation of this verse in every Rak'ah of his prayers, there is a reminder for him of the Hereafter, and an urging for him to prepare with righteous deeds and to refrain from sins and evil deeds.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse identifies Allah as the sole *Master of the Day of Judgment*, the day of accountability, reminding believers of the afterlife and urging them towards righteousness.</p>

          <h2>Verse 5</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help in all our affairs, for the whole matter is in Your hands, and no one owns an atom's weight of it. And in this verse, there is evidence that it is not permissible for a servant to direct any type of worship, such as supplication, seeking help, slaughtering and circumambulation, except to Allah alone. And in it is the healing of hearts from the disease of attachment to other than Allah, and from the diseases of hypocrisy, conceit, and arrogance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes the core of Islamic faith, declaring that worship is due to Allah alone and that all help and reliance should be sought from Him alone.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Guide us along the Straight Path,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Guide us, direct us, and enable us to the straight path, and keep us steadfast on it until we meet you, which is Islam, the clear path leading to the pleasure of Allah and to His Paradise, which was indicated by the last of His messengers and prophets, Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him. There is no way to a servant's happiness except through steadfastness upon it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse is a supplication asking for guidance to the *Straight Path* which is Islam, the path leading to Allah’s pleasure and Paradise.</p>

          <h2>Verse 7</h2>
          <p class="arabic">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The path of those whom You have blessed, from the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, for they are the people of guidance and steadfastness. And do not make us among those who followed the path of those who have incurred (Your) wrath, who knew the truth and did not act upon it, and they are the Jews, and those who are like them, and those who have gone astray, who were not guided, and thus lost the way, and they are the Christians and those who followed their way. And in this supplication, there is a healing for the heart of the Muslim from the disease of denial, ignorance, and misguidance, and an indication that the greatest blessing is the blessing of Islam. And whoever is more knowledgeable of the truth and more obedient to it, is more worthy of the straight path. And there is no doubt that the companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, are the people most worthy of that after the prophets, peace be upon them. So, the verse indicates their virtue and their great status, may Allah be pleased with them. And it is recommended for the reciter to say in prayer after reading Al-Fatiha: (Amin), and its meaning is: O Allah, respond. It is not a verse from Surah Al-Fatiha according to the consensus of the scholars. Therefore, they agreed not to write it in the Mus'hafs (copies of the Quran).</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that *those You have blessed* are the prophets and righteous believers. It contrasts them with those who incurred Allah’s displeasure (those who knew the truth but rejected it) and those who are astray (those who deviated from the truth out of ignorance).</p>
