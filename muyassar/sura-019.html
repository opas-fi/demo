          <h2>Verse 82</h2>
          <p class="arabic">كَلَّا ۚ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">But no! Those ˹gods˺ will deny their worship and turn against them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The matter is not as they claim. The deities will not be a source of might for them; rather, these deities will disbelieve in their worship of them in the Hereafter, and will be their allies in their hostility and denial, contrary to what they thought about them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">These false gods will disown their worshipers on the Day of Judgment, turning into enemies. This highlights the futility of their polytheistic beliefs.</p>
