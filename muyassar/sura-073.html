          <p class="quran-text">Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far better and more rewarding. And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, your Lord - O Prophet - knows that you stand for prayer at night for less than two-thirds of it, and sometimes half of it, and sometimes one-third of it, and a group of your companions stand with you. And Allah alone is the One who determines the night and the day, and knows their measures, and what passes and remains of them. Allah knows that you cannot keep the whole night in prayer, so He has made it easy for you, so recite in the night prayer what is easy for you to recite from the Quran. Allah knows that there will be among you those whom illness will prevent from praying at night, and other people who travel throughout the land for trade and work, seeking from Allah's lawful provision, and other people who strive in the cause of Allah to exalt His word and spread His religion. So recite in your prayer what is easy for you from the Quran, and be steadfast in the obligatory prayers, and give the obligatory charity, and give charity in good and virtuous ways from your wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah. And whatever good you do, of acts of virtue and obedience, you will receive its reward and recompense from Allah on the Day of Resurrection, better than what you have presented in this world, and a greater reward, and seek Allah's forgiveness in all your affairs. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah knows the Prophet's dedication in night prayers, sometimes two-thirds, half, or a third of the night. He has made it easier due to believers' limitations and other responsibilities, like illness, travel, and fighting for His cause. The verse encourages reciting the Quran as much as possible, performing prayers, paying Zakat, and giving charity. These good deeds will be rewarded greatly by Allah. It also emphasizes seeking forgiveness, as Allah is All-Forgiving and Most Merciful.</p>
