          <p class="quran-text">Bid your people to pray, and be diligent in ˹observing˺ it. We do not ask you to provide. It is We Who provide for you. And the ultimate outcome is ˹only˺ for ˹the people of˺ righteousness.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And command, O Prophet, your family to pray, and be patient in its performance. We do not ask you for wealth; We provide for you and give to you. And the good outcome in this world and the Hereafter is for the people of piety.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is instructed to command his family to pray regularly. Allah is the provider, and the righteous will ultimately attain a good outcome.</p>

          <h2>Verse 133</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا يَأْتِينَا بِآيَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۚ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِي الصُّحُفِ الْأُولَىٰ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They demand, “If only he could bring us a sign from his Lord!” Have they not ˹already˺ received a confirmation of what is in earlier Scriptures?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And your deniers said, O Messenger: 'Why do you not bring us a sign from your Lord indicating your truthfulness? Has not this Quran come to them, confirming the truth in the previous scriptures?'</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers demand a sign, but the Quran itself is a sufficient proof and confirmation of earlier scriptures, which they already have.</p>

          <h2>Verse 134</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَوْ أَنَّا أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُوا رَبَّنَا لَوْلَا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولًا فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ نَذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Had We destroyed them with a torment before this ˹Prophet came˺, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and put to shame.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We had destroyed these deniers with punishment before We sent to them a messenger and sent down upon them a book, they would have said, 'Our Lord, why did you not send us a messenger from Yourself, so we would have believed him and followed Your signs and law, before we were humiliated and disgraced by Your punishment?'</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the disbelievers had been punished before the Prophet (peace be upon him) came, they would have claimed they would have followed had a messenger come to them. This shows their insincerity.</p>

          <h2>Verse 135</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ كُلٌّ مُتَرَبِّصٌ فَتَرَبَّصُوا ۖ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَابُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ وَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Say ˹to them, O Prophet˺, “Each ˹of us˺ is waiting, so keep waiting! You will soon know who is on the Straight Path and is ˹rightly˺ guided.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists of Allah: 'Each of us and you are awaiting the turns of time, and for whom the victory and success will be. So wait, for you will know who is on the straight path, and who among us and you is rightly guided to the truth?'</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is instructed to tell the disbelievers that both sides are waiting to see who is truly on the Straight Path. The truth will ultimately prevail.</p>
