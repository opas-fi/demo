We were warners of people with what benefits and harms them, and that is by sending messengers and revealing books, so that Allah's argument is established against His servants. In it, every wise matter is decreed and detailed from the Preserved Tablet to the scribes of the angels, concerning lifespans, sustenance, and other things that happen during that year, which cannot be altered or changed. This wise matter is a command from Us, so all that Allah, the Exalted, causes to happen, and ordains, and all that He inspires, is by His command, permission, and knowledge. We were senders of messengers to people, Muhammad and those before him, as a mercy from your Lord, O Messenger, to those to whom they were sent. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing who hears all voices, and the All-Knowing of all matters of His creation, both apparent and hidden. Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. If you are certain of this, know that the Lord of creation is its true god. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him alone, without any partners. He gives life and causes death. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers, so worship Him and not your deities who have no power to cause harm or benefit.</p>
