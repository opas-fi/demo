Their light will proceed before them and on their right hands, saying: Our Lord, perfect for us our light until we pass the path, and be guided to Paradise, and pardon us and forgive our sins and conceal them from us, indeed, You are over all things competent.</p>

          <p class="arabic">ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا امْرَأَتَ نُوحٍ وَامْرَأَتَ لُوطٍ ۖ كَانَتَا تَحْتَ عَبْدَيْنِ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا صَالِحَيْنِ فَخَانَتَاهُمَا فَلَمْ يُغْنِيَا عَنْهُمَا مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَقِيلَ ادْخُلَا النَّارَ مَعَ الدَّاخِلِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. Each was married to one of Our righteous servants, yet betrayed them. So their husbands were of no benefit to them against Allah whatsoever. Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has presented an example of the state of the disbelievers - in their mixing with Muslims, their closeness to them, and their association with them, and that this does not benefit them because of their disbelief in Allah - like the state of the wife of the prophet of Allah, Noah, and the wife of the prophet of Allah, Lot: where they were under the protection of two righteous servants of Ours, so they betrayed them in religion, as they were disbelieving. So, these two messengers did not avert anything from the punishment of Allah from their wives. And it was said to the two wives: Enter the Fire with those who enter it. And in this example is a proof that closeness to the prophets and the righteous does not benefit anything with bad deeds.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse provides the example of the wives of Prophet Noah and Prophet Lot who betrayed their husbands in faith. Their proximity to righteous men did not save them from the Fire, illustrating that faith is personal.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And Allah has presented an example of the state of the believers - those who believed in Allah and worshipped Him alone and acted according to His law, and that they are not harmed by the association of disbelievers in their dealings - like the state of Pharaoh's wife who was under the protection of the most severe of the disbelievers in Allah, while she was a believer in Allah, when she said: My Lord, build for me a house with You in Paradise and save me from the authority and trials of Pharaoh and from what emanates from him of evil deeds, and save me from the people who follow him in injustice and misguidance, and from their punishment.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And Allah has presented an example of those who believed: Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity and protected it from fornication, so Allah the Most High commanded Gabriel, peace be upon him, to blow into the opening of her garment, and the blow reached her womb, so she conceived Jesus, peace be upon him, and she believed in the words of her Lord, and acted according to His laws that He prescribed for His servants, and His books revealed to His messengers, and she was among those who obeyed Him.</p>
