          <p class="quran-text">The polytheists argue, “Had Allah willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped anything other than Him, nor prohibited anything without His command.” So did those before them. Is not the messengers’ duty only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the polytheists said: "If Allah had willed that we worship Him alone, we would not have worshipped anyone besides Him, neither we nor our forefathers before us, nor would we have forbidden anything He did not forbid." With such a false argument did the previous disbelievers argue, and they are liars. For Allah commanded them and forbade them and enabled them to do what He had assigned them, and gave them power and will through which their actions proceed. So their argument using fate and destiny is the most false of falsehoods after the messengers had warned them. The messengers who warn them are only responsible for delivering what they were assigned clearly.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The polytheists falsely claim that if Allah didn't want them to worship idols, they wouldn't. This verse refutes their excuse, clarifying that messengers are sent to deliver the message, and people have free will.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ ۚ وَمِنْكُمْ مَنْ يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ لِكَيْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And Allah, the Most High, created you, then He causes you to die at the end of your lives. And among you is he who is brought back to the worst of life, which is old age, just as he was in his childhood, not knowing anything of what he used to know. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful; His knowledge and power encompass everything. So Allah, who returned man to this state, is able to cause him to die, then resurrect him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah creates you and causes you to die. Some reach old age, losing their memory. Allah is All-Knowing and All-Powerful.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَاللَّهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي الرِّزْقِ ۚ فَمَا الَّذِينَ فُضِّلُوا بِرَادِّي رِزْقِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِيهِ سَوَاءٌ ۚ أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision. But those who have been much favoured would not share their wealth with those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession, making them their equals. Do they then deny Allah’s favours?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And Allah has favored some of you over others in what He has given you in the world of provision. So some of you are rich and some of you are poor, and some of you are masters and some of you are owned. So the owners do not give their slaves from what Allah has given them so that they would become equal partners with them in wealth. So if they are not satisfied with that for themselves, then why are they satisfied to make for Allah partners from among His slaves? Indeed, this is one of the greatest injustices and ingratitude for the blessings of Allah, the Exalted and Glorified.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah gives some more provision than others. However, the rich don't share with their slaves, implying they deny Allah's favors by being stingy, and this is a sign of ingratitude.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Allah sets forth a parable: a slave who lacks all means, compared to a ˹free˺ man to whom We granted a good provision, of which he donates ˹freely,˺ openly and secretly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. In fact, most of them do not know.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has presented an example clarifying the corruption of the polytheists' belief: a man enslaved, incapable of action, owning nothing, and another man free, possessing lawful wealth that Allah has provided him with, able to manage it and give from it in secret and openly. Would a sane person say there is equality between the two men? Likewise, Allah, the Creator, the Owner, the Controller, is not equal to His creation and His servants. So how can you make them equal? Praise be to Allah alone; He is the One worthy of praise and commendation. Rather, most of the polytheists do not know that praise and blessings are from Allah, and that He alone is worthy of worship.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse presents a parable of a powerless slave and a free man with resources to illustrate that Allah is not comparable to any of His creation. All praise belongs to Allah alone, yet many people do not realize this.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And Allah sets forth a parable of two men: one of them is dumb, incapable of anything. He is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent, he brings no good. Can such a person be equal to the one who commands justice and is on the Straight Path?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And Allah has presented another example to invalidate polytheism: two men, one of whom is deaf and dumb, neither understands nor makes understood, unable to benefit himself or others, and is a heavy burden on whoever is in charge of him and supports him. If he is sent to do something, he does not succeed, nor does any good return from it. And another man is sound of senses, benefiting himself and others, commanding fairness, and is on a clear path with no crookedness in it. Are the two men equal in the eyes of the wise? So how can you make equal the dumb and deaf idol and Allah, the Capable, the Bestower of every good?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This parable compares a helpless person with one who is capable and upright to show that false idols cannot be compared to Allah, who is all-powerful and just. It emphasizes the clear difference between the Creator and His creation.</p>
