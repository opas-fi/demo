          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and We said to him, “Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment.” Noah said, “O my people, I am to you a clear warner of the punishment of Allah if you disobey Him, and I am a messenger of Allah to you, so worship Him alone, and fear His punishment, and obey me in what I command you and what I forbid you. If you obey me and respond to me, Allah will forgive your sins, and will extend your lives to a time appointed in the knowledge of Allah Almighty. Indeed, death, when it comes, will not be delayed ever; if you knew that, you would hasten to faith and obedience.”</p>

When they died, Satan suggested to their people that they should set up statues and pictures of them, so that they may, they claimed, be more active in obedience when they saw them. Then when those people passed away and a long time had passed, and others succeeded them, Satan whispered to them that their ancestors used to worship and supplicate through the statues and pictures, and this is the wisdom behind the prohibition of statues and the prohibition of building domes over graves, because with the passage of time they become worshiped by the ignorant. And those followed have led many of the people astray with the ways of evil and misguidance they have made appealing to them. Then Noah, peace be upon him, said: 'And do not increase, O our Lord, these unjust ones to themselves with disbelief and obstinacy, except further away from the truth.' Because of their sins and persistence in disbelief and transgression, they were drowned in the flood, and they were entered after the drowning into a fire of great flames and burning, and they did not find besides Allah anyone to support them, or avert from them the punishment of Allah.</p>

          <h2>Verse 22</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَمَكَرُوا مَكْرًا كُبَّارًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">and who have devised a tremendous plot,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Noah said, "My Lord, my people have exceeded in their disobedience and denial of me, and the weak among them have followed the astray leaders whose wealth and children have only increased them in misguidance in this world and punishment in the Hereafter, and the leaders of misguidance plotted against their followers from the weak a great plot, and said to them: 'Do not abandon the worship of your gods to the worship of Allah alone, which Noah calls to, and do not abandon Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasr.' -These are the names of their idols which they used to worship besides Allah, and they were the names of righteous men. When they died, Satan suggested to their people that they should set up statues and pictures of them, so that they may, they claimed, be more active in obedience when they saw them. Then when those people passed away and a long time had passed, and others succeeded them, Satan whispered to them that their ancestors used to worship and supplicate through the statues and pictures, and this is the wisdom behind the prohibition of statues and the prohibition of building domes over graves, because with the passage of time they become worshiped by the ignorant. And those followed have led many of the people astray with the ways of evil and misguidance they have made appealing to them. Then Noah, peace be upon him, said: 'And do not increase, O our Lord, these unjust ones to themselves with disbelief and obstinacy, except further away from the truth.' Because of their sins and persistence in disbelief and transgression, they were drowned in the flood, and they were entered after the drowning into a fire of great flames and burning, and they did not find besides Allah anyone to support them, or avert from them the punishment of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Noah describes his people's great plot against him and their adherence to falsehood.</p>
