          <p class="quran-text">They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Your companions will ask you, O Prophet, about the spoils of war on the day of Badr. How will you divide them among them? Tell them: The matter is up to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger will divide them by the command of his Lord. So fear Allah's punishment and do not rush to disobey Him. Leave disputes and quarrels over this wealth. Reconcile yourselves and adhere to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger if you are believers. Faith calls for obedience to Allah and His Messenger.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that the distribution of war spoils is determined by Allah and His Messenger. It emphasizes the importance of fearing Allah, resolving disputes, and obeying divine guidance for true believers.</p>

You love victory over the caravan rather than fighting, and God wants to establish Islam and make it supreme by His command to you to fight the infidels, and to eradicate the infidels by destruction.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah promised victory over one of two groups: the caravan or the enemy army. The believers desired the easier victory. However, Allah willed to establish the truth and destroy disbelief through actual combat.</p>

But if you return to war and fighting Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and fighting his believing followers, then We promise to defeat you as you were defeated on the day of Badr. Your group will not avail you at all, just as it did not avail you on the day of Badr despite your large number and equipment and the small number and equipment of the believers.

          <p class="arabic">إِذْ أَنْتُمْ بِالْعُدْوَةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ بِالْعُدْوَةِ الْقُصْوَىٰ وَالرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ ۚ وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدْتُمْ لَاخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي الْمِيعَادِ ۙ وَلَٰكِنْ لِيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْرًا كَانَ مَفْعُولًا لِيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَنْ بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَىٰ مَنْ حَيَّ عَنْ بَيِّنَةٍ ۗ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹Remember˺ when you were on the near side of the valley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if the two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have certainly missed it. Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And remember when you were on the side of the valley closest to the city, and your enemy was encamped on the side of the farthest valley, and the trade caravan was in a place below you on the coast of the Red Sea. If you had tried to set a time for this meeting, you would have disagreed, but God gathered you without an appointment; to accomplish a matter that was to be done by the victory of His friends, and the failure of His enemies by killing and capturing; and that was so that whoever of them perished would perish because of a proof for God that was established for him and he witnessed it and his excuse was cut off, and so that whoever lived would live because of a proof for God that was established and made clear to him. And indeed, God is Hearing of the statements of both parties, nothing is hidden from Him, Knowing of their intentions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the circumstances of the Battle of Badr, where the two armies met unexpectedly. This divine arrangement allowed God to fulfill His plan, showing clear signs to both believers and disbelievers. Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing.</p>

          <h2>Verse 43</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِذْ يُرِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي مَنَامِكَ قَلِيلًا ۖ وَلَوْ أَرَاكَهُمْ كَثِيرًا لَفَشِلْتُمْ وَلَتَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي الْأَمْرِ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ سَلَّمَ ۗ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Allah showed them in your dream as few in number. Had He shown them to you as many, you ˹believers˺ would have certainly faltered and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you ˹from that˺. Surely He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And remember, O Prophet, when God showed you in your dream the small number of your enemy, so you informed the believers of that, and their hearts were strengthened, and they dared to fight them. If your Lord had shown you their large number, your companions would have hesitated to meet them, and you would have been cowardly and differed about the matter of fighting. But God saved you from failure and saved you from the consequences of that. He is All-Knowing of the secrets of hearts and the natures of souls.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse recounts a dream of the Prophet Muhammad, where the enemy's army was shown to be few, which encouraged the believers to fight. Had they been shown as a large army, they might have hesitated. Allah knows best what is in the hearts.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Then when your armies met, Allah made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in theirs, so Allah may establish what He had destined. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And remember also when the enemies came out onto the battlefield and you saw them as few, so you were bold with them, and they made you seem small in their eyes, so that they would stop preparing for war against you; so that God might carry out a matter that was to be done, and God's promise to you of victory and triumph would be fulfilled, so the word of God was supreme and the word of those who disbelieved was inferior. And to God is the final destination of all matters, so He will reward each according to what he deserves.</p>
          <p class="explanation">During the battle, Allah made the enemy seem small in the eyes of the believers and vice versa, to fulfill His plan for victory. Ultimately, all matters will return to Allah for judgment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And ˹remember˺ when Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But when the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And remember when Satan made attractive to the polytheists what they had come for and what they intended to do, and he said to them, "No one will defeat you today, for I will help you." But when the two parties met - the polytheists with Satan, and the Muslims with the angels - Satan turned back and said to the polytheists, "Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I see what you do not see of the angels who came to help the Muslims. Indeed, I fear Allah." So he abandoned them and disavowed them. And Allah is severe in penalty for whoever disobeys Him and does not repent with sincere repentance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes how Satan initially encouraged the disbelievers but then abandoned them when they faced the believers, revealing his fear of Allah's power and the divine support for the believers.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Remember when the polytheists, hypocrites, and those with sick hearts say, when they see the small number of Muslims and the large number of their enemies: 'These Muslims were deceived by their religion, which led them to these situations.' These hypocrites did not realize that whoever relies on God and trusts in His promise, God will not let him down, for God is Almighty, nothing is beyond His power, and He is Wise in His planning and making.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law and emigrated to the abode of Islam, or a land where they could worship their Lord, and strove in the cause of Allah with their wealth and lives, and those who accommodated the emigrants in their homes and supported them with their wealth and aided the religion of Allah - those are helpers of one another. As for those who believed and did not emigrate from the abode of disbelief, you are not obligated to protect them and aid them until they emigrate. And if they are wronged by the disbelievers and they seek your aid, then respond to them, except in the case of a people between you and whom there is a firm treaty which they have not broken. And Allah is Seeing of your deeds. He will reward each according to his intention and his work.</p>

It also clarifies that believers who do not emigrate are not entitled to the same level of support unless they are persecuted for their faith. In such cases, aid is obligatory unless it interferes with existing treaties.</p>
