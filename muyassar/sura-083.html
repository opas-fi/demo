          <p class="muyassar">Severe punishment is for those who give less than due measure and weight, those who, when they buy by measure or weight from people, take full measure for themselves, but when they measure or weigh for others, they reduce the measure and weight, so how would be the state of those who steal and embezzle these things and cheat people of their belongings? Indeed, they deserve the threat even more than those who reduce measure and weight. Do those who reduce measure and weight not believe that Allah Almighty will resurrect them and hold them accountable for their actions on a day of great horror? A day when people will stand before Allah, and He will hold them accountable for the little and the much, and they will be submissive to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
