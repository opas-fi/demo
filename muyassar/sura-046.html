          <p class="muyassar">We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth, not in vain or futile. Rather, so that the servants may know the greatness of their Creator and worship Him alone, and know that He is able to return the servants after their death, and to establish truth and justice among themselves, and for a specified term with Him. And those who denied that Allah is the True God are turning away from what the Quran has warned them with, they do not take heed, nor do they reflect.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose, not in vain, and for a specific term. Yet, disbelievers turn away from these warnings, failing to reflect on the purpose of creation.</p>

Verily, Allah does not guide to Islam and the attainment of truth the people who have wronged themselves by their disbelief in Allah.”</p>

          <p class="quran-text">We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We have enjoined upon man to be good in his companionship with his parents, being dutiful to them in their lives and after their death. For his mother carried him as a fetus in her womb with hardship and fatigue, and gave birth to him with hardship and fatigue as well, and the duration of his carrying and weaning is thirty months. And in mentioning these hardships that the mother endures without the father, is evidence that her right upon her child is greater than the right of the father. Until when this person reaches the end of his physical and mental strength, and reaches forty years, he calls upon his Lord, saying: My Lord, inspire me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and enable me to do righteous deeds that please You, and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You from my sins, and indeed, I am of those submissive to You in obedience, and submitting to Your command and Your prohibition, and yielding to Your judgment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the importance of honoring parents, especially mothers, acknowledging the hardships of childbirth and child-rearing. It also emphasizes gratitude to Allah and striving for good deeds, including praying for righteous offspring and submitting to Allah's will, especially when one reaches maturity.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And the Day when those who disbelieved will be presented to the Fire for punishment, it will be said to them in rebuke: 'You exhausted your good things in your worldly life and enjoyed them, so today - O disbelievers - you will be recompensed with the punishment of disgrace and humiliation in the Fire, because of what you used to arrogantly behave in the earth without right, and because of what you used to disobey Allah.'</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَاذْكُرْ أَخَا عَادٍ إِذْ أَنْذَرَ قَوْمَهُ بِالْأَحْقَافِ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ النُّذُرُ مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا اللَّهَ إِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And remember the brother of ’Ȃd, when he warned his people, who inhabited the sand-hills—there were certainly warners before and after him—˹saying,˺ “Worship none but Allah. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous day.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And remember, O Messenger, the prophet of Allah, Hud, the brother of 'Aad in lineage, not in religion, when he warned his people that the punishment of Allah would befall them, while they were in their homes known as "Al-Ahqaf", which are the numerous sands south of the Arabian Peninsula. And the messengers had passed with warnings to their people before Hud and after him: that you should not associate anything with Allah in your worship of Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of Allah on a day whose terror will be great, which is the Day of Resurrection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse recounts Prophet Hud's warning to his people, the 'Aad, who lived in sand-hills. He urged them to worship Allah alone, cautioning them about a severe punishment to come.</p>

It is a wind in which is a painful, agonizing punishment."</p>

And We gave them hearing with which they hear, and sight with which they see, and hearts with which they understand. But they used them in what displeased Allah with them, so they were of no avail when they were denying the proofs of Allah. And there befell them of the punishment what they mocked and hastened. This is a threat from Allah, may His Majesty be exalted, and a warning to the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah had given the people of 'Aad power and faculties that the people of Mecca did not have. However, their senses did not benefit them, as they rejected the signs of Allah, bringing the punishment they used to mock.</p>
