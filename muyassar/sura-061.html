          <h2>Verse 5</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ لِمَ تُؤْذُونَنِي وَقَدْ تَعْلَمُونَ أَنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَلَمَّا زَاغُوا أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me when you already know I am Allah’s messenger to you?” So when they ˹persistently˺ deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And mention to your people - O Messenger - when the prophet of Allah, Moses, peace be upon him, said to his people: Why do you harm me with words and actions, while you know that I am the messenger of Allah to you? So when they turned away from the truth with their knowledge of it, and persisted in that, Allah turned their hearts away from accepting guidance as a punishment for their deviation that they chose for themselves. And Allah does not guide the people who are disobedient and depart from the path of truth.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse recounts how Moses was hurt by his people despite knowing he was Allah's messenger. When they persisted in their deviation, Allah turned their hearts away as a consequence, showing that Allah does not guide those who are willfully disobedient.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And ˹remember˺ when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel!

          <p class="quran-text">Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies about Allah when invited to submit ˹to Him˺? For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah and makes partners for Him in worship, while he is invited to enter Islam and dedicate worship to Allah alone?

Stand up for Allah, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah.” Then a group from the Children of Israel believed while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, be supporters of Allah's religion, as the disciples of Jesus were supporters of Allah's religion when Jesus said to them, "Who among you will be my supporter and helper in what draws near to Allah?" They said, "We are the supporters of Allah's religion." So a group from the Children of Israel were guided, and a group went astray. Then We supported those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and helped them against those who opposed them from the sects of the Christians, and they became dominant over them; that was through the mission of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.</p>
