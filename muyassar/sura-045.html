          <h2>Verse 24</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَقَالُوا مَا هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَا إِلَّا الدَّهْرُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُمْ بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ ۖ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And they argue, “There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die; others are born. And nothing destroys us but ˹the passage of˺ time.” Yet they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They only speculate.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And these polytheists said: There is no life except our worldly life in which we are, no life besides it; denying the resurrection after death, and nothing destroys us except the passing of nights and days and the length of life; denying that they have a Lord who causes them to perish and destroys them, and these polytheists have no knowledge of that, they only speak with conjecture, delusion, and imagination.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the disbelievers' claim that there is no life after death, attributing their existence and demise to time. It highlights that they have no real knowledge and are only speculating.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if what you say is true!”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When Our verses are recited to these polytheists who deny the resurrection, clear, they have no argument except to say to the Messenger Muhammad: Bring back to life, you and the believers with you, our fathers who have perished, if you are truthful in what you say.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the disbelievers' challenge to the Prophet, asking him to bring their dead ancestors back to life as proof of his message.</p>
