Nothing from His creation resembles or is like Him, neither in His essence, nor in His names, nor in His attributes, nor in His actions; because His names are all beautiful, His attributes are attributes of perfection and greatness, and His actions, the Exalted, brought into existence the magnificent creations without any partner.

Allah chooses for Himself whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns ˹to Him˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has ordained for you – O people – from the religion that We have revealed to you -O Messenger, which is Islam- what He enjoined upon Noah to do and to convey, and what We enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (these five are the resolute messengers according to the famous view), that: Establish the religion by believing in the Oneness of Allah and obeying Him and worshiping Him alone, without others, and do not differ in the religion that I have commanded you with. Great is what you call them to, from the Oneness of Allah and sincerity in worshiping Him, to the polytheists.

          <p class="quran-text">Or do they have associate-gods who have ordained for them some ˹polytheistic˺ beliefs, which Allah has not authorized? Had it not been for ˹prior˺ decree on Judgment, the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or do these polytheists with Allah have partners in their polytheism and misguidance, who have innovated for them from religion and polytheism what Allah has not permitted? And if it were not for Allah's decree and His predestination in giving them respite, and not hastening the punishment for them in this world, judgment would have been passed between them by hastening the punishment for them. And indeed, the disbelievers in Allah will have a painful and agonizing punishment on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse challenges the polytheists and their false gods, asking if they have any divine authority for their practices. If it were not for a set term, punishment would be immediate for the wrongdoers.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">That ˹reward˺ is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good.

Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.</p>

Say - O Messenger - to those who doubt the Hour from the polytheists of your people: I do not ask you for any compensation for the truth that I have come to you with, except that you love me for my kinship with you, and maintain the family ties between me and you. And whoever earns a good deed, We will multiply it for him by ten or more. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His servants, Appreciative of their good deeds and their obedience to Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the reward for believers who do good deeds and emphasizes that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) asks only for love for kinship, not material gain. Allah forgives sins and appreciates good deeds.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back ˹to the world˺?”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And whomever Allah leads astray from guidance because of his wrongdoing, then he has no helper to guide him to the path of guidance. And you, O Messenger, will see the disbelievers in Allah on the Day of Resurrection - when they see the punishment - saying to their Lord: Is there any way for us to return to the world, so that we may act in obedience to You? But they will not be answered in that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those whom Allah allows to stray will have no guide. Wrongdoers will beg to return to the world when they see the torment, but it will be too late.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And you will see - O Messenger - these wrongdoers being presented to the Fire, humbled and submissive, looking at the Fire from a glance, weak and humiliated by fear. And those who believed in Allah and His Messenger in Paradise will say, when they witness the loss of the disbelievers: Indeed, the true losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection by entering the Fire. Unquestionably, the wrongdoers - on the Day of Resurrection - will be in a lasting torment that will not cease or vanish from them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Judgment, wrongdoers will be humiliated as they face the Fire. Believers will recognize that true loss is experienced by those who lose themselves and their families to eternal punishment.</p>
