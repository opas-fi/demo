          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَضَلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, He will render their deeds void.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who denied that Allah is the only true God, without any partners, and turned people away from His religion, Allah has nullified their deeds, made them void, and made them wretched because of it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that those who reject faith and obstruct others from following God's path will have their deeds rendered worthless.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَآمَنُوا بِمَا نُزِّلَ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۙ كَفَّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَأَصْلَحَ بَالَهُمْ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">As for those who believe, do good, and have faith in what has been revealed to Muḥammad—which is the truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who believed in Allah and followed His law and believed in the Book that was sent down to Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, which is the truth without a doubt from their Lord, He has pardoned them and concealed from them what they did of evil deeds, so He will not punish them for it, and He has set their affairs right in this world and the hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse speaks of the believers who perform good deeds and believe in the divine revelation to Prophet Muhammad. They will have their sins forgiven and their condition improved by God.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">This is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah shows people their true state ˹of faith˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">That straying and guidance is because those who disbelieved followed Satan and obeyed him, and those who believed followed the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and what he brought of light and guidance, as Allah has made clear the actions of both groups, the people of disbelief and the people of faith, with what they deserve. He sets forth their examples for people, and attaches to each group of examples and forms what is appropriate.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that the disbelievers follow falsehood while believers follow the truth from God. This difference reveals their distinct paths and states of faith.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah, He will never render their deeds void.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So, when you meet - O believers - those who disbelieve in the battlefields, then strike their necks, until when you have weakened them by much killing and broken their strength, then secure the ties of the captives: either to bestow favor on them by freeing them without compensation, or to ransom themselves with money or otherwise, or to enslave them or kill them, and continue in that until the war ends. That is the ruling mentioned in the trial of the believers by the disbelievers and the alternation of days between them, and if Allah willed, He would have given victory to the believers over the disbelievers without fighting, but He made their punishment by your hands, so He prescribed Jihad to test you by them, and to grant victory to His religion by you. And those who are killed in the path of Allah from the believers, Allah will not invalidate the reward of their deeds. He will guide them during their lives in this world to His obedience and His pleasure, and He will set right their condition, their affairs, and their reward in this world and the hereafter, and He will admit them into Paradise. He has made it known to them and described it to them, and guided them to do what He commanded them - including martyrdom in His cause - then He has made known to them, when they enter Paradise, their dwellings in it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the conduct during warfare.  Believers are instructed to strike the necks of disbelievers until subdued, then to take captives, who can later be freed by grace or ransom. It also mentions the concept of testing through conflicts and that the deeds of martyrs will not be in vain.</p>
