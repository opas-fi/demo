          <p class="arabic">وَلَا يَأْتَلِ أُولُو الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ وَالسَّعَةِ أَنْ يُؤْتُوا أُولِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينَ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلْيَعْفُوا وَلْيَصْفَحُوا ۗ أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Do not let the people of virtue and affluence among you swear to suspend donations to their relatives, the needy, and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love to be forgiven by Allah? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And let not those of virtue and abundance among you swear not to give to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants, and to withhold from them the expenses; because of a sin they committed, but let them pardon and overlook their offenses. Do you not like that Allah should pardon you? Then pardon them. And Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them. And in this is an urging to pardon and forgive, even if it is met with wrongdoing.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those with wealth and virtue are encouraged to forgive their relatives and the needy, and to continue helping them, even if they have done wrong. It is a reminder that Allah is All-Forgiving and Merciful, and we should strive to be as well.</p>

So the disbeliever thinks that his deeds will benefit him, but when the Day of Resurrection comes, he will not find any reward for them, and he will find Allah, the Exalted, in wait for him, so He will pay him the full recompense for his deeds. And Allah is swift in account, so let not the ignorant be slow to see that promise, for it must come to pass.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The deeds of disbelievers are compared to a mirage, appearing beneficial but ultimately worthless. On the Day of Judgment, they will find Allah ready to hold them accountable for their disbelief.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And when your children reach the age of puberty, let them seek permission ˹to come in˺, as their seniors do. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>

And Allah is All-Knowing of what is best for His servants, All-Wise in His legislation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When children reach puberty, they should seek permission before entering private spaces, similar to adults. This verse highlights the importance of privacy and proper etiquette within the household, as taught by Allah's wisdom.</p>

          <h2>Verse 60</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَنْ يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ ۖ وَأَنْ يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَهُنَّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">As for elderly women past the age of marriage, there is no blame on them if they take off their ˹outer˺ garments, without revealing their adornments. But it is better for them if they avoid this ˹altogether˺. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the elderly women who have ceased to desire and have no lust due to their old age, they should not seek men for marriage, nor should men seek them either. So, there is no blame upon them to lay aside some of their [outer] garments, such as the cloak that is over their [inner] garments, without displaying or exposing adornment. And their wearing these garments - as a covering and chastity - is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearing of your statements, All-Knowing of your intentions and deeds.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Elderly women who no longer have a desire for marriage are allowed to remove their outer garments, provided they do not display their adornments. However, it's still better for them to maintain modesty. Allah knows all our intentions and deeds.</p>

          <p class="arabic">لَيْسَ عَلَى الْأَعْمَىٰ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى الْأَعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى الْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَنْ تَأْكُلُوا مِنْ بُيُوتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ آبَائِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ إِخْوَانِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخَوَاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَعْمَامِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ عَمَّاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخْوَالِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ خَالَاتِكُمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُمْ مَفَاتِحَهُ أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ ۚ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَنْ تَأْكُلُوا جَمِيعًا أَوْ أَشْتَاتًا ۚ فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمْ بُيُوتًا فَسَلِّمُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِكُمْ تَحِيَّةً مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ مُبَارَكَةً طَيِّبَةً ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">There is no restriction on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick. Nor on yourselves if you eat from your homes, or the homes of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your paternal uncles, or your paternal aunts, or your maternal uncles, or your maternal aunts, or from the homes in your trust, or ˹the homes of˺ your friends. There is no blame on you eating together or separately. However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and good. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will understand.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">There is no blame upon the people with excuses, the blind, the lame, and the sick, for leaving the obligatory matters that they are unable to perform, such as Jihad and the like, which depends on the sight of the blind or the soundness of the lame or the health of the sick. And there is no blame upon yourselves - O believers - in eating from the houses of your children, or from the houses of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your paternal uncles, or your paternal aunts, or your maternal uncles, or your maternal aunts, or from the houses that you are entrusted to protect in the absence of their owners with their permission, or from the houses of friends. And there is no blame upon you to eat together or separately. So, when you enter houses, inhabited or uninhabited, then let some of you greet others with the greeting of Islam, which is: 'As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings),' or 'As-salamu alayna wa ala ibadillahi as-salihin (Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah),' if no one is present. And this greeting is legislated by Allah, and it is blessed, increasing affection and love, pleasant and beloved to the listener. And with such clarification, Allah clarifies for you the landmarks of His religion and His verses, so that you may understand them and act upon them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">There is no blame on people with disabilities or illnesses for not fulfilling certain obligations, such as participating in Jihad, if they are unable. Also, people can eat from the homes of close relatives and friends. When entering homes, greet each other with a peaceful greeting. This is how Allah clarifies His verses so we may understand.</p>

          <h2>Verse 62</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِذَا كَانُوا مَعَهُ عَلَىٰ أَمْرٍ جَامِعٍ لَمْ يَذْهَبُوا حَتَّىٰ يَسْتَأْذِنُوهُ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَأْذِنُونَكَ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ۚ فَإِذَا اسْتَأْذَنُوكَ لِبَعْضِ شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَنْ لِمَنْ شِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمُ اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">The ˹true˺ believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission ˹O Prophet˺ are the ones who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to whoever you wish and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The true believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, and if they are with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, on a matter that gathers them for the benefit of the Muslims, none of them should leave until he asks for his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission, O Prophet, are those who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger, so if they ask your permission for some need of theirs, then grant permission to whomever you wish from those who seek permission to leave for a valid reason, and ask for forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His repentant servants, Merciful to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">True believers show their faith by respecting the Prophet's authority. They do not leave gatherings without his permission, highlighting their obedience. If they seek permission for a valid reason, the Prophet may grant it and ask Allah for forgiveness on their behalf.</p>

          <h2>Verse 63</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَا تَجْعَلُوا دُعَاءَ الرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَاءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضًا ۚ قَدْ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ يَتَسَلَّلُونَ مِنْكُمْ لِوَاذًا ۚ فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Do not treat the Messenger’s summons to you ˹as lightly˺ as your summons to one another. Allah certainly knows those of you who slip away, hiding behind others. So let those who disobey his orders beware, for an affliction may befall them, or a painful torment may overtake them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Do not say, O believers, when you call the Messenger of Allah, “O Muhammad,” nor “O Muhammad, son of Abdullah,” as some of you say to one another, but honor him and say, “O Prophet of Allah,” “O Messenger of Allah.” Allah knows the hypocrites who secretly leave the Prophet's assembly, peace and blessings be upon him, without his permission, seeking refuge with one another. So let those who disobey the command of the Messenger of Allah beware, lest a trial and evil befall them, or a painful, agonizing torment strike them in the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The call of the Prophet should be treated with utmost respect, unlike casual calls among each other. Allah is aware of those who try to sneak away from the Prophet's gatherings. Those who disobey the Prophet's orders are warned of potential trials and torment in this life and the hereafter.</p>
