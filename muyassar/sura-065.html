          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُوا الْعِدَّةَ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ ۖ لَا تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِنْ بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلَا يَخْرُجْنَ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُبَيِّنَةٍ ۚ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ ۚ لَا تَدْرِي لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ أَمْرًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ When you ˹intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period, and count it accurately. And fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes ˹during the waiting period˺, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever transgresses Allah’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O Prophet, when you - you and the believers - intend to divorce women, then divorce them at the beginning of their waiting period - that is, in a period of purity in which no intercourse has occurred, or in an apparent pregnancy - and keep count of the waiting period, so that you may know the time of return if you wish to reconcile with them, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not expel the divorced women from the houses they dwell in until their waiting period has expired, which is three menstrual cycles for those other than the young, the menopausal, and the pregnant. And it is not permissible for them to leave them on their own, unless they commit a clear, immoral act, such as adultery. And those are the laws of Allah that He has legislated for His servants. And whoever transgresses the laws of Allah has wronged himself and brought himself to destruction. You do not know - O divorcee - perhaps Allah will bring about after that divorce a matter you do not expect, and you reconcile with her.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs on the proper way to divorce, emphasizing the importance of timing it with regard to the waiting period ('iddah). It prohibits forcing women out of their homes during this period unless they commit a clear wrong. The verse also highlights that divorce can be a time for reflection, with the possibility of reconciliation.</p>

          <h2>Verse 2</h2>
          <p class="arabic">فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُوا ذَوَيْ عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ لِلَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ مَخْرَجًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Then when they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or separate from them honourably. And call two of your reliable men to witness ˹either way˺—and ˹let the witnesses˺ bear true testimony for ˹the sake of˺ Allah. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make a way out for them,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So when the divorced women approach the end of their waiting period, then either retain them with good companionship and spending on them, or part with them with full fulfillment of their rights, without harming them. And call to witness two just men from among you over the reconciliation or separation, and give the testimony - O witnesses - purely for Allah, not for anything else. That which Allah has commanded you is that with which is advised he who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears Allah, acts upon what He has commanded him, and avoids what He has forbidden him, He will make for him a way out of every distress, and make easy for him the means of sustenance from where he does not expect or take into account. And whoever puts his trust in Allah, then He is sufficient for him in all his affairs. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His command; nothing escapes Him and nothing He seeks can defeat Him. Allah has made for everything a term to which it reaches its end, and a measure it does not exceed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that at the end of the waiting period, the husband must choose between retaining the wife with kindness or separating with dignity and without harm. Witnesses are required for either decision. The verse also states that those who fear Allah will find solutions to their problems and be provided for by Him.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, and those who have not menstruated as well. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the divorced women who have ceased to menstruate due to their old age - if you are in doubt and do not know what is the ruling regarding them, then their waiting period is three months. And the young ones who have not yet menstruated, their waiting period is three months as well. And those with pregnancy from the women, their waiting period is that they give birth to their pregnancies. And whoever fears Allah, and implements His laws, He will make for him ease in his affairs in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies the waiting period for women who no longer menstruate, those who have not yet menstruated, and those who are pregnant. It indicates that the waiting period for the first two groups is three months and for pregnant women, it is until delivery. It also highlights that fearing Allah leads to ease in one's affairs.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Let them live where you live ˹during their waiting period˺, according to your means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable.

And do not harm them in order to make it difficult for them in their dwellings. And if your divorced women are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth. And if they breastfeed your children for you for a fee, then give them their dues. And let some of you instruct others in what is known of generosity and goodwill. And if you do not agree on breastfeeding, then another breastfeeding woman other than the divorced mother will breastfeed for the father.</p>
