          <p class="arabic">بَرَاءَةٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى الَّذِينَ عَاهَدْتُمْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹This is˺ a discharge from all obligations, by Allah and His Messenger, to the polytheists you ˹believers˺ have entered into treaties with:</p>
          <p class="muyassar">This is a declaration of innocence from God and His Messenger, and a declaration of abandoning the covenants that were between the Muslims and the polytheists.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse declares the termination of treaties between Muslims and polytheists, signifying a new phase in their relationship.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">“You ˹polytheists˺ may travel freely through the land for four months, but know that you will have no escape from Allah, and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So travel - O polytheists - in the land for a period of four months, going wherever you wish, safe from the believers, and know that you will not escape punishment, and that God will humiliate the disbelievers and cause them to be disgraced in this world and the Fire in the Hereafter. This verse is for those who have absolute, non-temporary covenants, or for those who have a covenant of less than four months, so that four months may be completed for them, or for those who had a covenant and broke it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Polytheists are given a four-month grace period to travel safely, but are warned that they cannot escape Allah's punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">A declaration from Allah and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from Allah. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And a notification from Allah and His Messenger and a warning to the people on the Day of Sacrifice that Allah is free from the polytheists, and His Messenger is free from them as well. So if you - O polytheists - return to the truth and abandon your polytheism, then it is better for you. But if you turn away from accepting the truth and refuse to enter the religion of Allah, then know that you will not escape the punishment of Allah. And warn - O Messenger - those who turn away from Islam of the painful punishment of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">A public announcement is made that Allah and His Messenger are free from obligations to polytheists. Polytheists are urged to repent, or face a painful punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">As for the polytheists who have honoured every term of their treaty with you and have not supported an enemy against you, honour your treaty with them until the end of its term. Surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The exception to the previous ruling are the polytheists who entered into a covenant with you for a specific period of time, and did not betray the covenant, and did not assist any of the enemies against you, so complete their covenant with them until its limited end. Indeed, God loves the righteous who did what they were commanded to do, and avoided polytheism, betrayal, and other sins.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Treaties with polytheists who have honored their agreements should be upheld until the end of their term. Allah loves those who are mindful of their obligations.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists ˹who violated their treaties˺ wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So when the four months in which you granted security to the polytheists have passed, declare war on the enemies of God wherever they may be, and target them by besieging their strongholds, and lie in wait for them on their roads. If they turn away from their disbelief and enter Islam and adhere to its laws of establishing prayer and giving zakat, then leave them alone, for they have become your brothers in Islam. Indeed, God is Forgiving to those who repent and return, and Merciful to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">After the Sacred Months, fighting is allowed against polytheists who violated their treaties. However, if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, they are to be set free.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ˹O Prophet˺, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If one of the polytheists whose blood and property are permissible asks to enter your protection, O Messenger, and desires safety, then respond to his request so that he may hear the Noble Qur'an and learn of its guidance, then return him to where he came from in safety; this is to establish proof against him; this is because the disbelievers are a people ignorant of the truths of Islam, so they may choose it if ignorance is removed from them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If a polytheist seeks protection to hear the word of Allah, they should be granted it and then escorted to a place of safety. This highlights the importance of knowledge and the removal of ignorance.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">How can such polytheists have a treaty with Allah and His Messenger, except those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque? So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The polytheists should not have a covenant with Allah and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a covenant at the Sacred Mosque in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. So long as they continue to fulfill your covenant, then continue to do the same for them. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous, who fulfill their covenants.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse discusses treaties with polytheists, stating that only those with existing agreements, like the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, should be honored if they remain faithful. It emphasizes that Allah loves those who are mindful of their obligations.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The polytheists are bound by their covenants as long as others are in control. However, if they feel they have power over the believers, they do not respect kinship or covenants. So do not be deceived by how they treat you when they fear you. They say things to you with their tongues so that you will be pleased with them, but their hearts refuse that, and most of them rebel against Islam and break their covenants.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the untrustworthy nature of polytheists. They only abide by treaties when they are weak; if they gain power, they will disregard any agreements and show their true animosity.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They chose a fleeting gain over Allah’s revelations, hindering ˹others˺ from His Way. Evil indeed is what they have done!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">They replaced the verses of God with the trivial worldly show, so they turned away from the truth and prevented those who desired Islam from entering it. Their actions were ugly and their deeds were evil.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse criticizes the polytheists for prioritizing worldly gains over Allah's revelations and for hindering others from embracing Islam. Their actions are described as wicked and evil.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">If they stop worshipping other than God, and utter the word of monotheism, and adhere to the laws of Islam, such as establishing prayer and paying zakat, then they are your brothers in Islam. We explain the verses and clarify them for people who will benefit from them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse offers a path to reconciliation. If polytheists repent, pray, and pay alms-tax, they become brothers in faith. It highlights that Allah clarifies His teachings for people of knowledge.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But if they break their oaths after making a pledge and attack your faith, then fight the champions of disbelief—who never honour their oaths—so perhaps they will desist.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If these polytheists break the covenants you have concluded with them and openly attack the religion of Islam, then fight them, for they are the leaders of misguidance, with whom there is no covenant or protection, until they cease their disbelief and hostility towards Islam.</p>

They would make permissible the four months that they had delayed forbidding one year, and forbid them another year, in order to match the number of the four months, and they would make permissible what Allah had forbidden of them.

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land? Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, what is the matter with you that when you are told, 'Go forth to fight in the cause of Allah to fight your enemies,' you become lazy and remain in your homes? Have you preferred your worldly fortunes over the pleasures of the Hereafter? What you enjoy in this world is little and fleeting, but the pleasures of the Hereafter that Allah has prepared for the believing mujahidin are abundant and everlasting.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse questions why believers hesitate to fight in Allah's cause, preferring worldly comfort. The temporary nature of this life is contrasted with the everlasting rewards of the Hereafter.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">If you do not march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you with other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If you do not go forth, O believers, to fight your enemy, Allah will send down His punishment upon you and will bring another people who will go forth when they are called upon and obey Allah and His Messenger. And you will not harm Allah at all by turning away from jihad, for He is independent of you and you are the ones in need of Him. And whatever Allah wills will inevitably happen. And Allah is over all things competent, from supporting His religion and His Prophet to your exclusion.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse warns that if believers do not answer the call to fight for Allah, He will punish them and replace them with others more willing. Allah is self-sufficient and is not harmed by their disobedience.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion, “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O group of companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, do not go out with him, O believers, when he calls you to mobilization, and do not support him; Allah supported him and aided him on the day when the infidels of Quraysh expelled him from his country (Makkah), and he was the second of two (he and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him) and they took them to a tunnel in Mount Thawr (in Makkah), and they stayed there for three nights, then he said to his companion (Abu Bakr) when he saw his fear for him: Do not be sad, Allah is with us with His victory and support, so Allah sent down reassurance in the heart of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and aided him with soldiers that no human had seen, and they are the angels, so Allah saved him from his enemy and humiliated his enemies, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah is the highest, that is by raising the status of Islam. And Allah is Mighty in His kingdom, Wise in managing the affairs of His servants. And in this verse there is a great virtue for Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reminds believers that Allah supported the Prophet Muhammad during his emigration from Mecca, even when he had only one companion. Allah's help is far greater than any human support. This verse highlights Allah's power and wisdom and the importance of faith during trials.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Allah, the Almighty, rebuked a group of hypocrites who asked permission from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to stay behind from the Battle of Tabuk, explaining that if their departure had been for a nearby and easy-to-obtain spoil, they would have followed you. However, when they were called to fight the Romans on the outskirts of the Levant in the heat of the day, they were cowardly and stayed behind. They will apologize for staying behind, swearing that they are unable to do so, destroying themselves with lies and hypocrisy, and Allah knows that they are liars in the excuses they give you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reveals that some hypocrites would have followed the Prophet if the journey and the reward were easier. Their excuses and oaths are rejected, highlighting their insincerity.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Among the poor hypocrites are those who make a covenant with themselves: If God gives them money, they will give charity from it, and they will do what the righteous do with their money, and they will walk in the path of righteousness.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse speaks of people who vowed to give charity if Allah blessed them with wealth, showing an intention to act righteously.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When God gave them from His grace, they were stingy in giving charity and spending money on good deeds, and they turned away, turning away from Islam.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When Allah fulfills their vow by giving them wealth, they break their promise, becoming stingy and turning away from good deeds.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Those who stayed behind and remained behind the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, were happy to stay in Medina, disobeying the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. They hated to fight with him with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. Some of them said to one another: Do not go out in the heat. The Battle of Tabuk took place at a time of intense heat. Say to them, O Messenger: The fire of Hell is more intense in heat, if only they knew that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The hypocrites were happy to stay behind and not participate in the battle. They disliked fighting for God and tried to discourage others by saying it was too hot. The verse warns that the fire of hell is much hotter.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">When you return, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone—they are truly evil. Hell will be their home as a reward for what they have committed.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The hypocrites will swear to you by God - lying and apologetic - if you return to them from the invasion; to leave them without questioning, so avoid them and turn away from them out of contempt for them. They are evil in their hearts, and their place in the Hereafter is the fire of Hell; as a reward for what they used to earn of sins and transgressions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The hypocrites will swear by Allah to avoid accountability and to be left alone. However, their actions are condemned and their ultimate abode is Hell as a consequence of their deeds.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">These hypocrites swear to you, O believers, falsely so that you may be pleased with them. If you are pleased with them - because you do not know that they are lying - then God will not be pleased with these people and others who persist in their immorality and disobedience to God and His Messenger.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">The Bedouins, the inhabitants of the desert, are more disbelieving and hypocritical than the people of the city, due to their harshness, the hardness of their hearts, and their distance from knowledge and scholars, and gatherings of preaching and remembrance. Therefore, they are more deserving of not knowing the limits of religion, and what God has revealed of laws and rulings. And God is All-Knowing of the condition of all of these people, and Wise in His management of the affairs of His servants.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that Bedouin Arabs are considered more extreme in their disbelief and hypocrisy because they are distant from knowledge and religious guidance. They are less likely to understand religious laws revealed to the Prophet.</p>

Indeed, these deeds bring them closer to God Almighty, and God will admit them into His Paradise. Indeed, God is Forgiving of what they have done of evil, Merciful to them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">التَّائِبُونَ الْعَابِدُونَ الْحَامِدُونَ السَّائِحُونَ الرَّاكِعُونَ السَّاجِدُونَ الْآمِرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَالنَّاهُونَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَالْحَافِظُونَ لِحُدُودِ اللَّهِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹It is the believers˺ who repent, who are devoted to worship, who praise ˹their Lord˺, who fast, who bow down and prostrate themselves, who encourage good and forbid evil, and who observe the limits set by Allah. And give good news to the believers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Among the characteristics of these believers who have the good news of entering Paradise are that they are those who repent and return from what Allah hates to what He loves and is pleased with, who sincerely worship Allah alone and strive to obey Him, who praise Allah for all the good and evil He has tested them with, who fast, who bow and prostrate in their prayers, who command people to do everything that Allah and His Messenger have commanded and forbid them from everything that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, who perform Allah's obligations and desist from His commands and prohibitions, who stand in His obedience and abide by His limits. And give good news, O Prophet, to these believers who have these characteristics of Allah's pleasure and Paradise.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the qualities of believers who are promised Paradise. They are those who repent, worship sincerely, praise Allah, fast, pray, encourage good and forbid evil, and adhere to Allah's laws.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">It is not ˹proper˺ for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It was not appropriate for the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and those who believed to ask for forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were their relatives, after they died as polytheists and worshipped idols, and it became clear to them that they were the people of Hell because they died as polytheists. God does not forgive polytheists, as God Almighty said: {Indeed, God does not forgive association with Him ( 4:48 )} and as He Almighty said: {Indeed, whoever associates others with God - God has forbidden him Paradise ( 5:72 )}.</p>
          <p class="explanation">It is not appropriate for the Prophet or believers to seek forgiveness for those who died as polytheists (those who worshipped others besides Allah), even if they were relatives, because they are destined for Hellfire.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">As for Abraham’s prayer for his father’s forgiveness, it was only in fulfilment of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of Allah, he broke ties with him. Abraham was truly tender-hearted, forbearing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Abraham's seeking of forgiveness for his polytheist father was only because of a promise he had made to him, which was: {I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, He is ever Gracious to me.} ( 19:47 ) When it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of God and that preaching and reminding him would not benefit him, and that he would die a disbeliever, he left him and stopped seeking forgiveness for him, and disavowed him. Abraham, peace be upon him, was a man of great supplication to God, and was very forgiving of the mistakes of his people.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Prophet Abraham's prayer for his father's forgiveness was only due to a promise. Once it was clear his father was an enemy of Allah, Abraham broke ties with him. Abraham is described as tender-hearted and forbearing.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Allah guided His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to repent to Him and obey Him.

Allah accepted their repentance after the hearts of some of them almost turned away from the truth, so they inclined towards ease and tranquility, but Allah made them steadfast and strengthened them and accepted their repentance. He is Kind and Merciful to them. And from His mercy towards them is that He bestowed upon them repentance, accepted it from them, and made them steadfast in it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah has turned with mercy to the Prophet, the Emigrants, and the Helpers who stood by him in hardship. He accepted their repentance after some had almost faltered. Allah is Gracious and Merciful to them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَعَلَى الثَّلَاثَةِ الَّذِينَ خُلِّفُوا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوا أَنْ لَا مَلْجَأَ مِنَ اللَّهِ إِلَّا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ لِيَتُوبُوا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And ˹Allah has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained behind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Likewise, Allah accepted the repentance of the three Ansar who were left behind - Ka'b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah, and Murarah ibn al-Rabi' - who stayed behind from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and were deeply saddened, until the earth, despite its vastness, became too narrow for them with grief and regret because of their staying behind, and their souls became too tight for them because of the worry that had befallen them, and they were certain that there was no refuge from Allah except to Him, so Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, guided them to obedience and to return to what pleases Him, the Most High. Indeed, Allah is the Accepter of Repentance to His servants, the Most Merciful towards them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes Allah's acceptance of the repentance of three companions who initially lagged behind in a campaign. Their distress and realization that only Allah could grant them refuge led to His mercy and their repentance being accepted. This highlights Allah's mercy and willingness to forgive.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It was not appropriate for the people of the city of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the surrounding Bedouins to stay behind with their families and homes and not to accept for themselves comfort while the Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was in fatigue and hardship. This is because they did not suffer thirst, fatigue or famine in their travels and jihad in the way of Allah, nor did they tread on a land that angered the infidels, nor did they inflict death or defeat on the enemy of Allah and their enemy except that they were written for all of that as the reward of a righteous deed. Indeed, Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse criticizes those who avoided joining the Prophet (peace be upon him) in jihad, emphasizing that any hardship endured for the sake of Allah is recorded as a good deed. It also reinforces the idea of shared hardship and support in faith.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is not appropriate for the believers to go out all together to fight their enemy, just as it is not right for them to sit all together. Why not have a group go out from each group who would achieve sufficiency and the intended goal? This is so that those who have left may gain an understanding of the religion of God and what was revealed to His Messenger, and warn their people of what they have learned when they return to them, so that they may beware of God's punishment by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that it's not necessary for all believers to go out for military expeditions. Instead, some should stay to gain religious knowledge and warn their people when they return. This highlights the importance of both physical and intellectual engagement in the faith.</p>
