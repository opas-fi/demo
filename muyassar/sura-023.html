          <h2>Verse 116</h2>
          <p class="arabic">فَتَعَالَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Exalted is Allah, the True King! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Honourable Throne.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Disposer of all things, Who is the Truth, His promise is true, His threat is true, and everything from Him is true, and He is far above creating anything in vain or foolishly. There is no god but He, the Lord of the Noble Throne, which is the greatest of creations.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is the Exalted True King. He is far above creating anything in vain. He is the only God and Lord of the Noble Throne.</p>

          <h2>Verse 117</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَمَنْ يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ لَا بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الْكَافِرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Whoever invokes, besides Allah, another god—for which they can have no proof—they will surely find their penalty with their Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will never succeed.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And whoever invokes with Allah another god for which he has no proof, then his recompense for his evil deed is with his Lord in the Hereafter. Indeed, there is no success or salvation for the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who worship other gods besides Allah will face punishment, and the disbelievers will have no success or salvation.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And say - O Prophet -: My Lord, overlook sins and have mercy; and You are the best of those who show mercy to one who has sinned, for He accepts his repentance and does not punish him for his sin.</p>
