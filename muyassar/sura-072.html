          <h2>Verse 26</h2>
          <p class="arabic">عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say -O Messenger- to these polytheists: 'I do not know whether the torment you are promised is near in time, or whether my Lord will make a long duration for it?' He is the Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His unseen to anyone of His creation, except whom Allah has chosen for His message and approved of, for indeed He will reveal to them some of the unseen. And He sends from before the Messenger and from behind him angels to protect him from the jinn, lest they eavesdrop and whisper it to the soothsayers. So that the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, may know that the messengers before him were in the same state as him, conveying the truth and sincerity, and that he was protected as they were protected from the jinn, and that Allah has encompassed in His knowledge what they have, externally and internally, of laws and rulings and other things, nothing of it escapes Him, and that He has enumerated everything in number, so nothing of it is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is the Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose this knowledge to anyone except to those He chooses as messengers.</p>
