          <p class="muyassar">Rather, I am better than this one who has no honor with him, for he demeans himself in his needs due to his weakness and insignificance, and he can hardly make his speech clear because of his speech impediment, and Pharaoh was prompted to this statement by disbelief, obstinacy and turning away from the path of Allah.</p>

You will be entering it.” (21:98). And the polytheists said, ‘We are content that our gods should be in the same status as Jesus.’ Then Allah revealed His saying: “Those for whom the best has preceded from Us – they will be far removed from it.” (21:101).

          <h2>Verse 78</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَقَدْ جِئْنَاكُمْ بِالْحَقِّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَارِهُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">We certainly brought the truth to you, but most of you were resentful of the truth.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those criminals, after Allah had admitted them to Hell, called to "Malik", the keeper of Hell: O Malik, let your Lord put us to death, so we may find relief from what we are in. But Malik replied to them: Indeed you are to remain, there is no exit for you from it, nor is there any escape for you. We had indeed come to you with the truth and clarified it for you, but most of you were those who hated the truth that the messengers had brought.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The truth was brought to them, but they rejected it and were resentful of it. This rejection is the cause of their suffering.</p>

          <h2>Verse 79</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَمْ أَبْرَمُوا أَمْرًا فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Or have they mastered some ˹evil˺ plan? Then We ˹too˺ are surely planning.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or have these polytheists determined a plan by which they plot against the truth that We brought to them? Then We are planning for them what will requite them with torment and punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the disbelievers plot against the truth, Allah also has a plan for them which will result in their punishment.</p>

          <h2>Verse 80</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لَا نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَاهُمْ ۚ بَلَىٰ وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Or do they think that We do not hear their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks? Yes ˹We do˺! And Our messenger-angels are in their presence, recording ˹it all˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or do these polytheists with Allah think that We do not hear what they conceal within themselves, and what they whisper to each other? Yes, We hear and know, and Our noble, guardian angels write down all that they do.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is aware of the disbelievers' secret thoughts and talks, and His angels record everything. Nothing is hidden from Allah.</p>

          <h2>Verse 81</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ إِنْ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْعَابِدِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the Most Compassionate ˹really˺ had offspring, I would be the first worshipper.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say - O Messenger - to the polytheists of your people who claim that the angels are the daughters of Allah: If the Most Gracious had a son, as you claim, then I would be the first of the worshippers of this son that you claim. But this has never been and will never be, so Allah is exalted above having a companion or a son.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses those who claim that God has offspring. If the Most Compassionate had a son, the Prophet would be the first to worship him, but this is a hypothetical, and God is far above such claims. </p>

And in this is a severe threat and warning for these disbelieving obstinate people and those like them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet is told to be patient, forgive them and respond with peace, as they will soon come to realize the consequences of their disbelief. This emphasizes the importance of patience and peace in the face of ignorance and harm.</p>
