          <p class="quran-text">All praise is for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made angels ˹as His˺ messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Praise be to Allah, with His attributes, all of which are attributes of perfection, and with His apparent and hidden blessings, both religious and worldly. The Creator of the heavens and the earth and their originator, the One who makes the angels messengers to whomever He wills of His servants, and in whatever He wills of His commands and prohibitions. And from the great power of Allah, He made the angels possess wings, two, three, and four, with which they fly, to convey what Allah has commanded. Allah increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent; nothing is difficult for Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse begins with praise to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and earth, and describes the angels as messengers with wings, highlighting Allah's unlimited creative power.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Whatever Allah opens for people of provision and rain and health and knowledge and other blessings, then no one is able to withhold this mercy. And what He withholds of it, then no one is able to send it after Him, Glory be to Him. And He is the Almighty, the Subduer of all things, the Wise, who sends mercy and withholds it according to His wisdom.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O humanity! Remember Allah’s favours upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you with your hearts, tongues, and limbs. There is no creator for you other than Allah, who provides for you from the sky with rain, and from the earth with water, minerals, and other things. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him alone, without any partner. So how are you turned away from His Oneness and worship?</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Are those whose evil-doing is made so appealing to them that they deem it good ˹like those who are rightly guided˺? ˹It is˺ certainly Allah ˹Who˺ leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides whoever He wills.

          <p class="muyassar">So is he to whom Satan has made pleasing his evil deeds of disobedience to Allah and disbelief and worship of deities and idols other than Him like one whom Allah has guided, so he sees good as good and evil as evil? Indeed, Allah misguides whom He wills of His servants and guides whom He wills, so do not destroy yourself in grief over the disbelief of these misguided ones. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of their evils, and He will recompense them for them with the worst of recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights how Satan can make evil deeds appealing to some, while Allah guides others. It reminds the Prophet not to grieve excessively over the disbelief of others, as Allah is fully aware of their actions.</p>

          <p class="arabic">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَائِفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ فَمَنْ كَفَرَ فَعَلَيْهِ كُفْرُهُ ۖ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الْكَافِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا مَقْتًا ۖ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الْكَافِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ إِلَّا خَسَارًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear ˹the burden of˺ their own disbelief. The disbelievers’ denial only increases them in contempt in the sight of their Lord, and it will only contribute to their loss.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah is the One who has made you - O people - successors on the earth. So, whoever denies the oneness of Allah among you, then upon himself is the harm of his denial and disbelief, and the disbelievers' disbelief does not increase them with their Lord except in hatred and anger, and their disbelief in Allah does not increase them except in misguidance and ruin.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah has made humans successors on Earth. Disbelief only harms the disbelievers themselves, increasing their disgrace and loss in the eyes of God.</p>

          <h2>Verse 40</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ شُرَكَاءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ أَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ كِتَابًا فَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَتٍ مِنْهُ ۚ بَلْ إِنْ يَعِدُ الظَّالِمُونَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا إِلَّا غُرُورًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Have you considered your associate-gods which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens? Or have We given the polytheists a Book, which serves as a clear proof for them? In fact, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say, [O Messenger], to the polytheists: Inform me of what thing your partners have created of the earth, or do your partners whom you worship besides Allah have any partnership with Allah in the creation of the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are on clear evidence therefrom? Rather, the disbelievers promise one another only delusion and deception.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet is asked to challenge the polytheists: Can their idols create anything? Do they share in the creation of the heavens? Do they have divine scripture to support their beliefs? The polytheists are only deluding themselves.</p>

          <h2>Verse 41</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَنْ تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِنْ زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ keeps the heavens and the earth from falling apart. If they were to fall apart, none but Him could hold them up. He is truly Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease [from their positions]. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, Allah is Forbearing in delaying punishment for the disbelievers and the disobedient, and Forgiving to those who repent of their sin and return to Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah alone maintains the heavens and the earth from collapsing. If they were to fall, none could hold them up. Allah is Forbearing and Forgiving to those who repent.</p>

          <h2>Verse 42</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَأَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِنْ جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْ إِحْدَى الْأُمَمِ ۖ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ مَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner were to come to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other community. Yet when a warner did come to them, it only drove them farther away—</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the disbelievers of Quraysh swore by Allah their strongest oaths that if a messenger came to them from Allah warning them of Allah's punishment, they would be more upright and more compliant to the truth than the Jews and Christians and others. But when Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to them, that only increased them in distance from the truth and aversion to it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers swore that they would be guided if a warner came to them. However, when a warner (Prophet Muhammad) came, it only increased their distance from the truth.</p>

          <h2>Verse 43</h2>
          <p class="arabic">اسْتِكْبَارًا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَمَكْرَ السَّيِّئِ ۚ وَلَا يَحِيقُ الْمَكْرُ السَّيِّئُ إِلَّا بِأَهْلِهِ ۚ فَهَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا سُنَّتَ الْأَوَّلِينَ ۚ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًا ۖ وَلَنْ تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ اللَّهِ تَحْوِيلًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil. But evil plotting only backfires on those who plot. Are they awaiting anything but the fate of those ˹destroyed˺ before? You will find no change in the way of Allah, nor will you find it diverted ˹to someone else˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Their oath is not for a good intention and a pursuit of the truth, but it is rather arrogance in the land against the creation. By it they intend evil plotting and deception and falsehood, and evil plotting only encompasses its own people. So do the arrogant plotters await anything except the punishment that befell their like who came before them? You will not find any change in Allah's way, nor any alteration. So no one is able to change or avert the punishment from himself or others.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Their disbelief stems from arrogance and evil plotting. Evil plots only backfire on the plotters themselves. They will inevitably face the consequences similar to those who came before them; Allah's way is constant.</p>

          <h2>Verse 44</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ وَكَانُوا أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً ۚ وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُعْجِزَهُ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَلِيمًا قَدِيرًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might. But there is nothing that can escape Allah in the heavens or the earth. He is certainly All-Knowing, Most Capable.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have the disbelievers of "Mecca" not travelled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them, like 'Aad and Thamud and their like, and what came upon them of destruction and upon their homes of ruin, when they denied the messengers? And those disbelievers were greater in strength and might than the disbelievers of "Mecca." And Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth could escape or overcome Him. Indeed, He is Knowing of their actions, Powerful to destroy them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">People are encouraged to reflect on the fate of those destroyed before them, who were stronger. Nothing escapes Allah's knowledge or power in the heavens or earth. He is All-Knowing and Most Capable.</p>

          <h2>Verse 45</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُوا مَا تَرَكَ عَلَىٰ ظَهْرِهَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ وَلَٰكِنْ يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ بَصِيرًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for what they have committed, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of His servants.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if Allah were to punish the people for what they have earned of sins and transgressions, He would not leave upon the earth any creature that moves upon it. But He delays them, and postpones their punishment to a time known to Him. So when their punishment comes, then Allah is ever of His servants Seeing. Nothing of them is hidden from Him, nor does anything of their affairs escape His knowledge, and He will recompense them for what they have done of good or evil.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that Allah's mercy is why He doesn't immediately punish people for their sins. He gives them time until their appointed term, when He will judge them.</p>
