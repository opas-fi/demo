          <p class="muyassar">Their hearts are heedless of the Noble Quran, preoccupied with the vanities of this world and its desires, and they do not understand what is in it. Rather, the wrongdoers among the Quraysh conspired in secret: to spread what prevents people from believing in Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that he is a human being like them, no different from them in anything, and that what he brought from the Quran is magic. So how can you come to him and follow him, while you see that he is a human being like you?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Their hearts are distracted from the Quran, and the wrongdoers secretly conspire, questioning the Prophet's humanity and calling his message 'magic'.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, referred the matter back to his Lord, glory be to Him, and said: My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal in your conversations. And He is the All-Hearing of your words, the All-Knowing of your conditions. And this is a threat and a warning to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet responds that his Lord knows all that is said in the heavens and the earth, and that He is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. This serves as a warning to the disbelievers.</p>

Then the sheep should be returned to their owner and the field to its owner, to equalize the value of the damaged crops with the benefit derived from the sheep. And both David and Solomon, We gave them judgment and knowledge, and We favored David by making the mountains and birds glorify Us when he glorified, and We were the doer of that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah guided Solomon to a fairer settlement in the case. Both David and Solomon were given wisdom and knowledge, and the mountains and birds glorified Allah with David.</p>
