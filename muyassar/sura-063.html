          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When the hypocrites come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they say, “We bear witness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah”—and surely Allah knows that you are His Messenger—but Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When the hypocrites come to you, [O Prophet], they say, "We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah." And Allah knows that you are His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse exposes the hypocrisy of those who outwardly declare that Prophet Muhammad is Allah's messenger, while their hearts do not believe. Allah attests to the Prophet's status while revealing the lies of the hypocrites.</p>

          <h2>Verse 2</h2>
          <p class="arabic">اتَّخَذُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ سَاءَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They have made their ˹false˺ oaths as a shield, hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">They have taken their oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] from the way of Allah. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing. That is because they believed, then they disbelieved, so their hearts were sealed over, and they do not understand.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse describes how hypocrites use their false oaths to mislead and hinder others from the path of Allah. Their actions are condemned as evil.</p>

          <h2>Verse 3</h2>
          <p class="arabic">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا فَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">This is because they believed and then abandoned faith. Therefore, their hearts have been sealed, so they do not comprehend.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">They have taken their oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] from the way of Allah. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing. That is because they believed, then they disbelieved, so their hearts were sealed over, and they do not understand.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that the reason for the hypocrites' actions is that after believing, they disbelieved, which resulted in their hearts being sealed, thus they cannot understand the truth.</p>

          <h2>Verse 4</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ تُعْجِبُكَ أَجْسَامُهُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ يَقُولُوا تَسْمَعْ لِقَوْلِهِمْ ۖ كَأَنَّهُمْ خُشُبٌ مُسَنَّدَةٌ ۖ يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ هُمُ الْعَدُوُّ فَاحْذَرْهُمْ ۚ قَاتَلَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to their ˹impressive˺ speech. But they are ˹just˺ like ˹worthless˺ planks of wood leaned ˹against a wall˺. They think every cry is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when you see them, their forms please you, and if they speak, you listen to their speech. [They are] as if they were pieces of wood propped up - they think that every shout is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they turned away?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the hypocrites' impressive appearance and speech, while portraying them as hollow and fearful like leaning wood. They are identified as the enemy and are condemned for their deception and deviation from the truth.</p>

          <h2>Verse 5</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْا يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ لَوَّوْا رُءُوسَهُمْ وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُمْ مُسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When it is said to them, “Come! The Messenger of Allah will pray for you to be forgiven,” they turn their heads ˹in disgust˺, and you see them ˹O Prophet˺ turn away in arrogance.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when it is said to these hypocrites, "Come, repent, apologizing for the evil words and foolish talk that came from you, so that the Messenger of Allah may seek forgiveness for you and ask Allah for forgiveness and pardon for your sins," they turn their heads away and shake them in mockery and arrogance, and you see them - O Messenger - turning away from you, while they are arrogant about complying with what is asked of them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the arrogant reaction of hypocrites when asked to seek forgiveness through the Prophet. They turned away in disdain, showing their unwillingness to repent.</p>

          <h2>Verse 6</h2>
          <p class="arabic">سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ لَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">It is the same whether you pray for their forgiveness or not, Allah will not forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide the rebellious people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is the same for these hypocrites whether you ask forgiveness for them from Allah - O Messenger - or do not ask forgiveness for them; indeed, Allah will never forgive their sins, for their persistence in wickedness and their firm establishment in disbelief. Indeed, Allah does not guide to faith those who disbelieve in Him, who go against His obedience.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Whether the Prophet prays for them or not, Allah will not forgive the hypocrites due to their persistent disbelief and rebellion against Him. Allah does not guide those who deliberately reject faith.</p>

          <h2>Verse 7</h2>
          <p class="arabic">هُمُ الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ لَا تُنْفِقُوا عَلَىٰ مَنْ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ حَتَّىٰ يَنْفَضُّوا ۗ وَلِلَّهِ خَزَائِنُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They are the ones who say ˹to one another˺, “Do not spend ˹anything˺ on those ˹emigrants˺ with the Messenger of Allah so that they will break away ˹from him˺.” But to Allah ˹alone˺ belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, yet the hypocrites do not comprehend.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These hypocrites are the ones who say to the people of "Medina," "Do not spend on the companions of the Messenger of Allah from the immigrants until they disperse from him." And to Allah alone belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth and what is in them of provisions; He gives them to whom He wills and withholds them from whom He wills, but the hypocrites have no understanding, and it does not benefit them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The hypocrites tried to hinder the believers by discouraging spending on them, hoping they would leave the Prophet. However, Allah possesses all provisions and resources, not them. This shows the hypocrites' lack of understanding.</p>

          <h2>Verse 8</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَقُولُونَ لَئِنْ رَجَعْنَا إِلَى الْمَدِينَةِ لَيُخْرِجَنَّ الْأَعَزُّ مِنْهَا الْأَذَلَّ ۚ وَلِلَّهِ الْعِزَّةُ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They say, “If we return to Medina, the honourable will definitely expel the inferior.” But all honour and power belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, yet the hypocrites do not know.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These hypocrites say, "If we return to 'Medina,' the mightiest of our group will surely expel the most humbled of them, the believers." And to Allah belongs all might, and to His Messenger, and to the believers in Allah and His Messenger, not to anyone else, but the hypocrites do not know that due to their extreme ignorance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The hypocrites claimed they would expel the believers upon returning to Medina. However, true honor and power belong to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, not to the hypocrites.</p>

          <h2>Verse 9</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَنْ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Do not let your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. For whoever does so, it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, let not your wealth or your children distract you from the worship of Allah and obedience to Him. And whoever is distracted by his wealth and children from that - then those are the losers of their shares of the honor and mercy of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse warns believers not to let wealth or children distract them from remembering Allah. Those who prioritize worldly things over devotion to Allah will be the true losers.</p>

          <h2>Verse 10</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَأَنْفِقُوا مِنْ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ فَيَقُولَ رَبِّ لَوْلَا أَخَّرْتَنِي إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ فَأَصَّدَّقَ وَأَكُنْ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And donate from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you, and you cry, “My Lord! If only You delayed me for a short while, I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And spend - O believers - in the cause of Allah and His Messenger some of what We have given you in good ways, hastening to do so before death comes to one of you and he sees its signs and indications, and then says regretfully, "My Lord, if only You would delay me and postpone my death until a short time, so I could give charity from my wealth and be among the righteous and pious."</p>
          <p class="explanation">Believers are urged to donate in the way of Allah before death comes. The dying will wish for more time to give charity and be righteous, but it will be too late.</p>
