          <p class="quran-text">Blessed is the One Who sent down the Standard to His servant, so that he may be a warner to the whole world.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Magnificent are the blessings of Allah, and abundant are His favors, and perfect are His attributes, Glory be to Him, the Exalted, Who sent down the Quran, which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, upon His servant Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, to be a messenger to mankind and jinn, warning them of Allah’s punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is blessed and exalted for revealing the Quran, the standard (Al-Furqan) for distinguishing right from wrong. This was sent down to Prophet Muhammad, who serves as a warner to all mankind and jinn.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹Allah is˺ the One to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, Who has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor does He have a partner in ˹governing˺ the kingdom. He has created everything, ordaining it precisely.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">The polytheists of the Arabs took deities besides Allah that cannot create anything, while Allah created them and created them, and they do not possess for themselves the power to repel harm or bring benefit, nor can they cause death or give life to the dead, or resurrect anyone from the dead alive from his grave.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the absurdity of worshipping idols. These idols cannot create, protect, or control anything, including life and death, demonstrating their powerlessness.</p>

They have committed a terrible injustice, and have come with a shameful falsehood; for the Quran is not something that a human being can invent.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers accuse the Quran of being a fabricated lie, claiming the Prophet Muhammad made it up with help. This verse refutes their accusation by stating it is an injustice and a falsehood.</p>

Why was not an angel sent down with him to testify to his truthfulness, or a treasure from wealth sent down to him from the sky, or a great garden for him to eat from its fruits? And these unjust disbelievers said: You believers are following only a man upon whom magic has overcome his mind.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers question why the Prophet eats food and walks in markets, challenging his claim as a messenger. They desired an angel to accompany him or other signs as proof.</p>

          <h2>Verse 71</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَمَنْ تَابَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَإِنَّهُ يَتُوبُ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَتَابًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah properly.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who believe in the Oneness of Allah, and do not invoke or worship any other deity besides Him, and do not kill a soul that Allah has forbidden except by due process of law: such as one who disbelieves after belief, or commits adultery after marriage, or kills a soul unjustly, and do not commit adultery, but guard their chastity, except with their spouses or those their right hands possess. And whoever does any of these major sins will meet a punishment in the Hereafter. The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgment, and he will abide therein, humiliated and disgraced. (And the threat of eternity is for whoever commits all of them, or for whoever associates partners with Allah). But whoever repents of these sins with a sincere repentance, and believes with firm faith coupled with righteous deeds, then those are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will erase and replace with good deeds; because of their repentance and remorse. And Allah is ever Forgiving to those who repent, Merciful to His servants as He calls them to repent after confronting Him with the greatest of sins. And whoever repents from the sins he committed, and does righteous deeds, then by that he returns to Allah with a correct return, so Allah accepts his repentance and forgives his sins.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Sincere repentance and righteous actions are a true return to Allah, which He accepts and forgives.</p>

          <h2>Verse 72</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ وَإِذَا مَرُّوا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّوا كِرَامًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹They are˺ those who do not bear false witness, and when they come across falsehood, they pass ˹it˺ by with dignity.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who do not bear false witness, nor attend its gatherings, and when they pass by the people of falsehood and vain talk without intent, they pass by with aversion, disliking it and do not approve of it for others.</p>
          <p class="explanation">True believers avoid false witness and when they encounter falsehood, they pass by with dignity, showing disapproval without engaging in it.</p>

          <h2>Verse 73</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّوا عَلَيْهَا صُمًّا وَعُمْيَانًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹They are˺ those who, when reminded of the revelation of their Lord, do not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to it.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who, when they are reminded by the verses of the Quran and the proofs of the Oneness of Allah, do not turn a blind eye to them, as if they were deaf, nor blind, but their hearts understood them, and their insights were opened to them, so they fall down prostrating to Allah, obedient.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When reminded of Allah's revelations, they do not ignore them, instead, they understand and obey them with humility.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Bless us with ˹pious˺ spouses and offspring who will be the joy of our hearts, and make us models for the righteous.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who ask Allah Almighty saying, “Our Lord, grant us from our spouses and our offspring those who will be a comfort to our eyes, and therein is our joy and pleasure, and make us an example to be followed in goodness.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">They pray for righteous spouses and offspring who bring joy to their hearts, also asking to be made examples for the righteous to follow.</p>

          <h2>Verse 77</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قُلْ مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّي لَوْلَا دُعَاؤُكُمْ ۖ فَقَدْ كَذَّبْتُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَكُونُ لِزَامًا</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Allah Almighty has informed that He does not care nor pay attention to people, were it not for their supplication to Him in worship and asking, and you have denied - O disbelievers - so your denial will lead to a punishment that will obligate you like the obligating of a debtor to his creditor, and will destroy you in this life and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah states that people's worth comes from their faith and devotion to Him. Disbelievers, who reject the truth, will certainly face a torment as a consequence of their denial.</p>
