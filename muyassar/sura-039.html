          <p class="arabic">أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِنْ دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, sincere devotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah. As for those who take other lords besides Him, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah,” surely Allah will judge between all regarding what they differed about. Allah certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and disbelief.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, to Allah alone belongs the complete obedience, free from polytheism. And those who associate with Allah others and take protectors besides Him say: "We do not worship those deities with Allah except that they may intercede for us with Allah and bring us closer to Him in rank," so they disbelieve in that, because worship and intercession are for Allah alone. Indeed, Allah will judge between the sincere believers and the polytheists with Allah on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they differed about in their worship, and He will recompense each according to what he deserves. Indeed, Allah does not guide to the straight path those who fabricate lies against Allah, and are ungrateful for His signs and proofs.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Sincere devotion is due to Allah alone. Those who take other deities as intercessors are misguided, and Allah will judge their differences. He does not guide those who lie and disbelieve.</p>

          <p class="arabic">خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَأَنْزَلَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْعَامِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ ۚ يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ خَلْقًا مِنْ بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ ثَلَاثٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul, then from it He made its mate. And He produced for you four pairs of cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Your Lord created you - O people - from Adam, and created his spouse from him, and created for you from the livestock eight kinds: male and female of camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, stage after stage of creation, in the darkness of the belly, the womb, and the placenta. That is Allah, who created these things, your Lord, the One in control, the One unique in divinity, the One worthy of worship alone. So how do you turn away from worshipping Him to worship others from His creation?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights Allah's creation, starting from one soul (Adam) and then his mate, as well as the creation of livestock. It emphasizes Allah's power in creating humans in stages within the womb and emphasizes that He is the only God deserving of worship. It questions why people turn away from Him.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful ˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If you disbelieve - O people - in your Lord and do not believe in Him, and do not follow His messengers, then He is free of need of you; He has no need of you, and you are the poor ones in need of Him. And He does not approve of disbelief for His servants, nor does He command them to do so. Rather, He approves of their gratitude for His blessings upon them. And no soul bears the burden of another soul. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do, and hold you accountable for it. Indeed, He is Knowing of the secrets of souls and what the hearts conceal.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse explains that Allah is not in need of anyone and does not approve of disbelief. He appreciates gratitude and faith. It also clarifies that no one will bear the burden of another's sins. It reminds people that they will return to Allah, who knows what is hidden in their hearts.</p>

          <h2>Verse 8</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِذَا مَسَّ الْإِنْسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَا رَبَّهُ مُنِيبًا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلَهُ نِعْمَةً مِنْهُ نَسِيَ مَا كَانَ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَ لِلَّهِ أَنْدَادًا لِيُضِلَّ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۚ قُلْ تَمَتَّعْ بِكُفْرِكَ قَلِيلًا ۖ إِنَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when a person is afflicted with affliction, hardship, and illness, he remembers his Lord, so he seeks His help and supplicates to Him. Then, if He answers him and removes his harm and grants him His blessings, he forgets his supplication to his Lord when he was in need of Him, and he associates others with Him, in order to mislead others away from belief in Allah and obedience to Him. Say to him - O Messenger - threateningly: Enjoy your disbelief for a little while until your death and the end of your term. Indeed, you are among the dwellers of the Fire, abiding therein forever.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes how people often turn to Allah in times of hardship, but forget Him once they receive blessings. It criticizes setting up equals to Allah and warns that disbelievers will end up in the Fire.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Is this disbeliever, enjoying his disbelief, better, or is the one who is worshipping his Lord, obedient to Him, spending the hours of the night in standing and prostrating to Allah, fearing the punishment of the Hereafter, and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say - O Messenger -: Are those who know their Lord and their true religion equal to those who do not know anything of that? They are not equal. Only those with sound minds remember and know the difference.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse contrasts those who worship Allah devoutly, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for His mercy, with those who do not. It asks if those who know are equal to those who do not, highlighting the importance of knowledge and understanding.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Say, O Messenger, to your stubborn people: 'Act according to your state that you have approved for yourselves, where you worship those who do not deserve worship, and have no control over anything. I am acting upon what I have been commanded to do, turning to Allah alone in my words and actions. So, you will soon know who will receive a humiliating punishment in this worldly life, and upon whom a lasting punishment will descend in the Hereafter? It will not turn away from him, nor will it cease.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse is a continuation from the previous one stating that it will be revealed who will be met with humiliation and everlasting punishment in this life and the next.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِنَّا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ لِلنَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ فَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ فَلِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا ۖ وَمَا أَنْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِوَكِيلٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Surely We have revealed to you the Book ˹O Prophet˺ with the truth for humanity. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. You are not a keeper over them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, We have sent down to you - O Messenger - the Quran in truth as guidance for the worlds, to the path of righteousness. So whoever is guided by its light, and acts according to what is in it, and is steadfast on its method, then the benefit of that returns to his own self. And whoever goes astray after guidance has become clear to him, then the harm only returns to his own self, and he will not harm Allah in any way. And you, O Messenger, are not a guardian over them to keep their deeds, hold them accountable for them, and force them to what you wish. Your only duty is to deliver the message.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Quran has been revealed as truth and guidance for humanity. Those who choose to follow it benefit themselves, while those who reject it harm themselves. The Prophet's role is to deliver the message, not to force belief.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Allah - Glory be to Him - is the One who takes the souls at the time of their death, and this is the major death, the death at the end of the term, and He takes the souls that have not died in their sleep, which is the minor death. Then He withholds from these two souls the soul on which He has decreed death, which is the soul of the one who died, and He sends the other soul to complete its term and sustenance by returning it to its owner's body. Indeed, in Allah's taking the soul of the dead and the sleeping, and sending back the soul of the sleeping and withholding the soul of the dead, there are clear signs of Allah's power for those who reflect and ponder.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah takes souls at death and during sleep. He keeps the souls of the deceased and returns the souls of the sleeping until their appointed time. This is a sign of Allah's power for those who reflect.</p>
