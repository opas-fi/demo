          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ ۖ ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">All praise is for Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light. Yet the disbelievers set up equals to their Lord ˹in worship˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Praise be to Allah for His attributes, all of which are perfect descriptions, and for His apparent and hidden blessings, both religious and worldly, He who created the heavens and the earth and what is in them, and created darkness and light, through the alternation of night and day. And in this is a sign of the greatness of Allah Almighty, and His exclusive right to be worshipped, so it is not permissible for anyone to associate anything with Him. Despite this clarity, the disbelievers equate others with Allah and associate partners with Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes that all praise belongs to Allah, who created the heavens, the earth, darkness, and light. Despite these clear signs of Allah's power, disbelievers still associate partners with Him.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">He is the One Who created you from clay, then appointed a term ˹for your death˺ and another known only to Him ˹for your resurrection˺—yet you continue to doubt!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">He is the One who created your father Adam from clay, and you are his descendants. Then He decreed the duration of your stay in this worldly life, and He decreed another fixed term that no one knows except Him, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is the Day of Resurrection. Then after this you doubt Allah's ability to resurrect after death.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created humans from clay and set two terms for them: one for their life on Earth and another, known only to Him, for the Day of Resurrection. Despite this, people still doubt the reality of resurrection.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And Allah, may He be glorified, is the God who is worshipped in the heavens and the earth. And among the signs of His divinity is that He knows all that you conceal - O people - and what you reveal, and He knows all your deeds, good or evil; and for this reason, He - may He be glorified and exalted - alone is the God worthy of worship.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is the only true God, worshipped in the heavens and earth. He knows all that is hidden and revealed, as well as all deeds. This knowledge confirms His sole right to be worshipped.</p>

So they will see that what they mocked is the truth and the truth. Allah will make clear the falsehood and fabrication of the deniers and will punish them for it.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Have they not seen how many ˹disbelieving˺ peoples We destroyed before them? We had made them more established in the land than you. We sent down abundant rain for them and made rivers flow at their feet. Then We destroyed them for their sins and replaced them with other peoples.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Did these who deny the Oneness of Allah Almighty and His exclusive right to worship, and deny His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, not know what befell the denying nations before them of destruction and devastation? We had established them in the land in a way that We did not establish you, O disbelievers, and We had blessed them with the sending down of rains and the flowing of rivers from beneath their dwellings; as a gradual progression and respite for them. So they disbelieved in Allah's blessings and denied the Messengers, so We destroyed them because of their sins, and We created after them other nations who succeeded them in the construction of the earth?</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse reminds people of the destruction of past disbelieving nations, despite Allah's favors like rain and rivers. They were destroyed for their sins, and their fate serves as a warning.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺, and they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And these polytheists said: “Why does Allah not send down an angel from the sky to Muhammad to confirm him in what he brought of prophethood?” And if We had sent down an angel from the sky in response to their request, the matter would have been decided by their destruction, then they would not be given respite for repentance, for it had been previously known by Allah that they would not believe.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers question why a visible angel was not sent with the Prophet. If an angel had been sent, the matter would have been decisively settled with immediate punishment for them as it was already known they would not believe.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And if We had sent an angel, We would have certainly made it ˹assume the form of˺ a man—leaving them more confused than they already are.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We had made the messenger sent to them an angel, since they were not convinced by Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, We would have made that angel in the form of a human being, so that they could hear from him and address him; for it is not possible for them to see the angel in his angelic form, and if the angel came to them in the form of a man, the matter would have become confusing to them, just as the matter of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, became confusing to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If Allah had sent an angel as a messenger, it would have appeared as a man to be understood. This would not have eliminated their confusion and disbelief, but rather increased it.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And since their request to send down an angel was by way of mockery of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, Allah Almighty made it clear to him that mocking the messengers, peace be upon them, is not a new thing, but it had happened to the previous disbelievers with their prophets, so the punishment that they were mocking and denying would befall them surrounded them.</p>

Indeed, you acknowledge that there are other deities with Allah that you associate with Him. Say to them - O Messenger -: I do not testify to what you have acknowledged. Indeed, Allah is one God, with no partner, and I am free from every partner you worship with Him.</p>

          <p class="arabic">بَلْ إِيَّاهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَاءَ وَتَنْسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">No! He is the only One you would call. And if He willed, He could remove the affliction that made you invoke Him. Only then will you forget whatever you associate with Him ˹in worship˺.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Rather, you will call upon your Lord, who created you - and no other - and you will seek His help, so He will relieve the great calamity that has befallen you if He wills; because He is able to do all things, and you will leave your idols, your false deities, and your patrons then.</p>
          <p class="explanation">In times of great distress, people instinctively turn to Allah alone. He is the only one who can remove afflictions and when He does, people forget the false deities they used to worship.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other people who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so perhaps they would be humbled.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We have sent - O Messenger - to groups of people before you Messengers calling them to Allah, the Exalted, but they denied them, so We afflicted them in their wealth with severe poverty and hardship of living, and We afflicted them in their bodies with diseases and pains; in the hope that they would humble themselves to their Lord, and submit to Him alone in worship.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah sent messengers before the Prophet Muhammad, and their people were tested with suffering so they would turn to Allah in humility.</p>

          <p class="explanation">When suffering came, instead of humbling themselves to Allah, their hearts became hardened. Satan made their evil deeds appealing, preventing them from repenting.</p>

If you are frightening me with your gods, that they may inflict harm upon me, then I do not fear them. They will not harm me, unless my Lord wills something. My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. Will you not then remember, and know that He alone is the Worshipped, deserving of worship?'</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ نَبَاتَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهُ خَضِرًا نُخْرِجُ مِنْهُ حَبًّا مُتَرَاكِبًا وَمِنَ النَّخْلِ مِنْ طَلْعِهَا قِنْوَانٌ دَانِيَةٌ وَجَنَّاتٍ مِنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالرُّمَّانَ مُشْتَبِهًا وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَابِهٍ ۗ انْظُرُوا إِلَىٰ ثَمَرِهِ إِذَا أَثْمَرَ وَيَنْعِهِ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكُمْ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky—causing all kinds of plants to grow—producing green stalks from which We bring forth clustered grain. And from palm trees come clusters of dates hanging within reach. ˹There are˺ also gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates, similar ˹in shape˺ but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Look at their fruit as it yields and ripens! Indeed, in these are signs for people who believe.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And Allah, the Glorified, is the One who sends down rain from the clouds, then brings forth by it the vegetation of everything, and brings forth from the vegetation green crops and trees, then brings forth from the crops grain that is layered upon one another, like the ears of wheat, barley, and rice, and brings forth from the spadix of the palm tree - which is where the clusters of dates originate - clusters that are easy to reach, and He, the Glorified, brings forth gardens of grapes, and He brings forth the olive and pomegranate trees, which resemble each other in their leaves and differ in their fruits in shape, taste, and nature. Look, O people, at the fruit of this vegetation when it bears fruit, and at its ripening and maturity when it reaches maturity. Indeed, in that - O people - are signs of the perfection of the power of the Creator of these things, and His wisdom and mercy for a people who believe in Him, the Exalted, and act according to His law.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah sends down rain, causing all kinds of plants to grow including grains, dates, grapevines, olives, and pomegranates. There are signs in the fruits and how they grow for those who believe.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَجَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ الْجِنَّ وَخَلَقَهُمْ ۖ وَخَرَقُوا لَهُ بَنِينَ وَبَنَاتٍ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۚ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Yet they associate the jinn with Allah ˹in worship˺, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters out of ignorance. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they claim!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And these polytheists made the jinn partners to Allah in worship, believing that they benefit or harm, and Allah, the Exalted, created them and what they worship from non-existence, so He is independent in creation alone, and it is obligatory that He be independent in worship alone, with no partner to Him. And these polytheists have lied about Allah, the Exalted, when they attributed to Him sons and daughters; out of ignorance of what is due to Him of the attributes of perfection. He is far exalted above what the polytheists have attributed to Him of that falsehood and fabrication.</p>
          <p class="explanation">People associate the jinn with Allah even though He created them and they falsely claim that He has children. Allah is far above what they claim.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Say -O Messenger- to these polytheists: Clear proofs have come to you by which you can see guidance from error, including what the Quran contains, and brought by the Messenger, peace be upon him. So whoever sees these proofs and believes in their meaning, then the benefit is for himself, and whoever does not see guidance after the proof has been established against him, then it is upon himself that he has committed injustice, and I am not a keeper over you to enumerate your deeds, but I am a deliverer, and Allah guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills according to His knowledge and wisdom.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Clear proofs and guidance have been sent, and the choice to believe is a personal one. Believing benefits the individual, while rejecting the truth only harms oneself. The Prophet's role is to deliver the message, not to force belief.</p>

          <h2>Verse 119</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُمْ مَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden to you—except when compelled by necessity? Many ˹deviants˺ certainly mislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows the transgressors best.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And what prevents you, O Muslims, from eating that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, while Allah has explained to you what He has forbidden to you? But what necessity has dictated due to famine, of what is forbidden to you, like dead meat, then it is permissible for you. And indeed, many of the misguided lead astray their followers from the path of Allah in making lawful what is forbidden and making forbidden what is lawful, out of their ignorance. Indeed, your Lord - O Messenger - is most knowing of who transgresses his limits in that, and He is the One who will take account and recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse questions why Muslims would avoid eating meat slaughtered in Allah's name, when He has clarified what is forbidden, except in extreme necessity. It warns against those who mislead out of ignorance and emphasizes that Allah knows the transgressors.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act of˺ disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their ˹human˺ associates to argue with you. If you were to obey them, then you ˹too˺ would be polytheists.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not eat - O Muslims - from the sacrifices upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned at the time of slaughter, like dead meat and what has been sacrificed to idols and jinn, and other than that, and indeed, eating from those sacrifices is disobedience to Allah Almighty. And indeed, the rebellious among the jinn inspire their allies from the human devils with doubts about the prohibition of eating dead meat, so they command them to say to the Muslims in their arguing with them: By your not eating dead meat, you do not eat what Allah has killed, while you eat what you slaughter, and if you obey them - O Muslims, in making lawful dead meat - then you and they are alike in associating partners with Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse prohibits eating meat not slaughtered in Allah's name, considering it disobedience. It notes how devils inspire their allies to argue against this, and that following such arguments can lead to polytheism.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Is one who was dead in misguidance, destroyed and bewildered, then We gave life to his heart with faith, and We guided him to it, and We enabled him to follow His messengers, so he lives in the lights of guidance, like one who is in ignorance and whims and scattered misguidances, not guided to a way out or a savior from what he is in? They are not equal. And just as I have failed this disbeliever who argues with you - O believers - so I made his evil deeds attractive to him, so he saw them as good, I have made attractive to the deniers their evil deeds, so that they deserve the punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.</p>

So Allah Almighty responded to them saying: Allah knows best where He places His message, that is, with those who are worthy of carrying His message and conveying it to the people. These tyrants will receive humiliation, and they will have a painful punishment in Hellfire because of their plotting against Islam and its people.</p>

And as Allah makes the breasts of the disbelievers severely constricted, so He will make the punishment upon those who do not believe in Him.</p>

Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And just as Satan made it alluring for the polytheists to allocate a share of crops and livestock to Allah Almighty, and a share to their partners, the devils made it alluring for many of the polytheists to kill their children for fear of poverty, so that they would cause these fathers to perish by killing the soul that Allah has forbidden to kill except for a just cause, and to confuse their religion, so that they become confused, go astray and perish. If Allah had willed that they not do that, they would not have done it, but He decreed that because of His knowledge of their evil state and destiny. So leave them - O Messenger - to their own devices and what they fabricate of lies, for Allah will judge between you and them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Just as the idolaters had misguided practices in dividing their crops, the verse explains that they also commit the atrocity of killing their children for fear of poverty.  Satan makes these heinous acts seem acceptable, causing confusion and leading to their ruin.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them except those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted from labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely attributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The polytheists said, “These are camels and crops that are forbidden; none may eat them except those we permit”—according to their claim—from the keepers of idols and others. And these are camels whose backs are forbidden, so it is not permissible to ride them or load them under any circumstances. And these are camels upon which they do not mention the name of Allah in any of their affairs. They did that as a lie from them about Allah; Allah will recompense them because of what they used to fabricate of lies about Him, glory be to Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse criticizes the polytheists for creating their own rules about which animals and crops were permissible or forbidden, falsely attributing these rules to Allah. They restricted certain foods, claiming they were only for select people, and did not slaughter animals in Allah's name, which is considered a lie against Him.</p>

Indeed, He is Wise in the management of the affairs of His creation, All-Knowing of them.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And Allah, the Exalted, is the One who has created for you gardens: some are raised from the ground, like grapevines, and some are not raised, but stand on their trunks, like palm trees and crops, with their varied tastes, and olives and pomegranates, similar in appearance but different in their fruit and taste. Eat, O people, from its fruit when it bears fruit, and give its obligatory alms due on the day of its harvest, and do not exceed the limits of moderation in spending money and eating food and other things.

          <p class="muyassar">These are the livestock that Allah has provided for His servants, consisting of camels, cattle, and sheep, in eight categories: four of them are from sheep, which are the male and female sheep, and the male and female goats. Say - O Messenger - to those polytheists: Has Allah forbidden the two males from sheep? If they say: Yes, then they have lied in that, because they do not forbid every male from sheep and goats. And say to them: Has Allah forbidden the two females from sheep? If they say: Yes, then they have also lied, because they do not forbid every female from the offspring of sheep and goats.

If they say: Yes, then they have also lied, because they do not forbid every fetus from that.

But whoever is compelled to eat from these forbidden things because of severe hunger, without seeking to eat them for pleasure, nor transgressing the limit of necessity, then indeed Allah is Forgiving to him, Merciful towards him. And it has been established - later on - by the Sunnah the prohibition of every beast of prey with a canine tooth, and every bird with a claw, and domesticated donkeys, and dogs.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies what is forbidden to eat in Islam, which includes carrion, blood, swine, and anything sacrificed in the name of other than Allah. It also notes the exception for those compelled by hunger, where Allah is forgiving and merciful.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ ۖ وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۖ وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۖ وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak, maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice. We do not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak, be just, even if it is a near relative. And fulfill the covenant of Allah. This has He instructed you that you may remember.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to protect the wealth of orphans, using it only to improve it until they reach maturity.

          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, that is My Path—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.”</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith. Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Do those who turned away and hindered from the path of Allah await anything but that the angel of death and his assistants should come to them to seize their souls, or that your Lord - O Messenger - should come to judge between His servants on the Day of Resurrection, or that some signs of the Hour and its indications of its coming should come, and that is the rising of the sun from its west? At that time, faith will not benefit a soul that did not believe before, nor will a good deed be accepted from it if it was a believer and did not do it before. Say to them - O Messenger - wait for that to come; so that you may know the truthful from the liar, and the wrongdoer from the righteous, we are indeed waiting for that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse warns those who delay belief, questioning if they await the angels, the Lord's coming, or major signs. Once these signs arrive, faith will not benefit those who didn't believe before or those who didn't act righteously. The verse concludes with a call to wait and see the outcome.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Whoever meets his Lord on the Day of Resurrection with a good deed from righteous actions, then for him there will be ten times the like of it, and whoever meets his Lord with an evil deed, then he will not be punished except with the like of it, and they will not be wronged the weight of an atom.</p>
