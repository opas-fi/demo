          <p class="muyassar">And those who disbelieve and deny the Resurrection said, "The Hour will not come to us." Say to them, [O Prophet], "Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you.

          <p class="muyassar">Is this man fabricating a lie against Allah, or is he possessed by madness, so he speaks without knowing? The matter is not as the disbelievers said, but Muhammad is the most truthful of the truthful. And those who do not believe in the Resurrection and do not work for it are in perpetual torment in the Hereafter, and in far straying from the truth in this world.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the disbelievers' accusations that the Prophet Muhammad was either fabricating lies or insane. It asserts that those who deny the Hereafter will face severe punishment and are far from the truth.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Have they not then seen all that surrounds them of the heavens and the earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause ˹deadly˺ pieces of the sky to fall upon them. Surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns ˹to Allah˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Do not these disbelievers, who do not believe in the Hereafter, see the great power of Allah in what is before them and behind them of the sky and the earth, which amazes the minds, and that they have encompassed them? If We will, We can cause the earth to swallow them up, as We did to Korah, or We can send down on them pieces of torment, as We did to the people of Shu'aib, for the sky rained down fire on them and burned them. Indeed, in that which We have mentioned of Our power is a clear sign for every servant who turns back to his Lord in repentance, and acknowledges His Oneness, and is sincere to Him in worship.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse urges disbelievers to reflect on the signs of Allah's power in the heavens and the earth. It reminds them that Allah could easily destroy them, and that these signs should encourage repentance and turning to Him.</p>

Indeed, I am Seeing of what you do; nothing is hidden from Me.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah instructed Prophet David to create well-made armor. This highlights the importance of both worldly skills and righteousness for David and his family. Allah emphasizes His constant observation of their deeds.</p>

And whoever of them deviated from Our command, We made them taste the torment of the blaze.</p>

At that time, the jinn knew that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in the humiliating torment and hard labor for Solomon, thinking that he was still alive. And in the verse is a refutation of the belief of some people that the jinn know the unseen, for if they had known the unseen, they would have known of Solomon's death, peace be upon him, and they would not have remained in the humiliating torment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they ˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn, in whom most of them had faith.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The angels will say: “Glory to You, O Allah, that you have no partner in worship. You are our Protector, whom we obey and worship alone. Rather, these were worshipping the devils; most of them were believers in them and obedient to them.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">The angels will disavow any involvement, affirming that they worship and are loyal to Allah alone. They clarify that the polytheists were actually following the temptations of the jinn (devils).</p>

          <p class="explanation">When clear verses of the Quran are recited, the disbelievers accuse Prophet Muhammad of trying to stop them from worshipping their ancestors' gods, and they call the Quran a fabrication and magic.</p>
