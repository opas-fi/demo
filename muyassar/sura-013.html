          <p class="arabic">المر ۚ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْكِتَابِ ۗ وَالَّذِي أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Alif-Lãm-Mĩm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book. What has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">(Alif, Lam, Mim, Ra). The discussion of the separate letters at the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah has preceded.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse begins with the letters *Alif-Lam-Mim-Ra*, which are unique to the Quran and their meaning is known to Allah. It emphasizes that the Quran is the truth revealed by Allah, though many disbelieve.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah, the Most High, is the One who raised the seven heavens with His power without pillars, as you see them, then He rose - meaning He ascended and elevated Himself - over the Throne in a manner that befits His Majesty and Greatness. And He subjected the sun and the moon for the benefit of the servants. Each of them revolves in its orbit until the Day of Judgment. He, Glory be to Him, manages the affairs of this world and the Hereafter, He clarifies for you the verses indicating His power and that there is no god but Him, so that you may be certain of Allah and the return to Him, and believe in His promise and His warning and devote worship to Him alone.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah is the One who raised the heavens without any visible pillars, established Himself on the Throne, and subjected the sun and moon to His laws. These signs are meant to assure belief in Allah and the meeting with Him.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And He, Glory be to Him, is the One who made the earth vast and wide, and prepared it for your sustenance, and placed mountains therein to stabilize it, and rivers for your drinking and benefit, and He made in it of all fruits two kinds, so some are white and black, sweet and sour, and He made the night cover the day with its darkness. Indeed, in all of that are lessons for a people who reflect upon them, and take heed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah spread out the earth, placed mountains and rivers, and created diverse fruits. The alternation of day and night serves as signs for those who reflect on the power and wisdom of the Creator.</p>

They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And in the earth are tracts adjoining each other, some of which are good, yielding what benefits people, and some are barren, salty, not producing anything. And in the good earth are gardens of grapes, and He made in it various crops and palm trees, clustered in one place and not clustered in another, all of that in the same soil, and watered with one water, but it differs in fruits, size, taste, and so on. This one is sweet and this one is sour, and some of them are better than others in eating. Indeed, in that are signs for those who have a heart that understands from Allah, the Most High, His command and prohibition.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Despite the earth having adjacent tracts, diverse gardens and crops, and being watered by the same water, Allah gives each of them a unique taste. This serves as signs for those who understand Allah's power.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if you wonder - O Messenger - at their disbelief after these evidences, then the most astonishing thing is the saying of the disbelievers: 'When we have died and become dust, shall we be raised anew?' Those are the ones who deny their Lord who brought them into being from nothing, and those will have chains of fire around their necks on the Day of Resurrection, and those will enter the Fire, and will never come out of it.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have ˹already˺ been ˹many˺ torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the deniers of the punishment hasten you, the one that I did not hasten for them before the faith with which security and good deeds are hoped for. And the punishments of the deniers before them have passed, so how do they not take heed of them? And indeed, your Lord - O Messenger - is indeed full of forgiveness for the sins of those who repent from their sins from among the people despite their wrongdoing, opening the door of forgiveness for them and calling them to it, while they wrong themselves by disobeying their Lord. And indeed, your Lord is severe in punishment for whoever persists in disbelief, misguidance, and disobedience to Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers challenge the Prophet by asking for immediate punishment, yet Allah is forgiving to those who repent but severe in punishment to those who persist in disbelief.</p>

And that is not in your hand - O Messenger - for you are only a deliverer to them and a warner of the might of Allah. And for every nation, there is a messenger to guide them to Allah the Exalted.</p>

The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">To Allah, the Exalted, belongs alone the call of monotheism (La ilaha illa Allah - there is no deity except Allah), so none is to be worshipped or invoked except Him. And the deities they worship besides Allah do not respond to the supplication of those who invoke them. Their state with them is like the state of a thirsty person extending his hand to water from afar; to reach his mouth but not reaching it. And the disbelievers’ asking of them is but an extreme in distance from the truth due to their associating others with Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse emphasizes that only Allah should be invoked because He is the only one who can respond. Those who call upon idols are like a thirsty person reaching for water that is out of reach, their calls are futile.</p>

Or can darkness and light be equal?” Or have they associated with Allah partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say - O Messenger - to the polytheists: Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and their manager? Say: Allah is their Creator and Manager, and you acknowledge that. Then say to them, compelling with proof: Have you taken besides Him gods for yourselves, and they are not able to benefit themselves or harm them, let alone benefit or harm you, and you have abandoned the worship of their Owner? Say to them - O Messenger: Are the disbeliever - who is like the blind - and the believer - who is like the seeing - equal in your view? Or is disbelief - which is like darkness - equal to belief - which is like light? Or do their allies whom they made partners with Allah create like His creation, so that the creation of the partners became similar to the creation of Allah, and they believed they deserve to be worshipped? Say to them - O Messenger: Allah is the Creator of every being from nothing, and He alone is the One worthy of worship, and He is the One, the Subduer who deserves divinity and worship, not idols and statues that neither harm nor benefit.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse challenges polytheists by asking who is the Lord of the heavens and earth. It highlights the absurdity of worshipping gods that can't benefit or harm, unlike Allah, the sole creator. It also compares belief and disbelief to light and darkness and the impossibility of equality between them.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The ˹worthless˺ residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Then Allah, the Exalted, gave an example for truth and falsehood by water He sent down from the sky, so that the valleys of the earth flowed according to their size. And the torrent carried a floating scum above it with no benefit. And He gave another example: it is metals that they kindle fire upon to melt them, seeking adornment as in gold and silver, or seeking benefits as in copper, so out of them comes their dross which is of no benefit, like that which was with the water. With this, Allah gives an example for truth and falsehood: Falsehood is like the scum of the water, which vanishes or is thrown away as there is no benefit from it, and the truth is like the clear water, and the pure metals remain in the earth for benefit.

          <p class="muyassar">For the believers who obeyed Allah and His Messenger is Paradise, and those who did not obey and disbelieved in Him, for them is Hell. Even if they owned all that is in the earth and twice as much with it, they would give it as a ransom for themselves from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection, and it will not be accepted from them. Those will be held accountable for all that they have done of evil deeds, and their abode and residence will be Hell which will be their bed, and how wretched the bed they have prepared for themselves.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who respond to Allah will receive Paradise as a reward. Those who reject Him will face severe punishment in Hell, and no amount of worldly possessions could ransom them from it. Their fate is a consequence of their deeds.</p>

Rather, to Allah alone belongs the whole matter of miracles and everything else. Have not the believers known that if Allah willed, all the people of the earth would have believed without a miracle? The disbelievers will continue to be struck by calamity because of their disbelief, such as killing and captivity in the battles of the Muslims, or that calamity will descend near their homes, until the promise of Allah comes with victory over them.

Or do you inform Allah of partners in His earth whom He does not know, or do you call them partners merely by a statement of the tongue without them having any reality? Rather, Satan has made fair-seeming to the disbelievers their false statements and has averted them from the path of Allah.

          <p class="arabic">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ حُكْمًا عَرَبِيًّا ۚ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ بَعْدَمَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا وَاقٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And so We have revealed it as an authority in Arabic. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or shield you from Allah.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And just as We sent down the scriptures to the prophets in their language, We have sent down to you - O Messenger - the Quran in the Arabic language, so that you may judge with it. And if you were to follow the desires of the polytheists in worshipping other than Allah - after the truth that has come to you from Allah - then you would have no helper to aid you and protect you from His punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Quran was revealed in Arabic as a clear authority. The Prophet is warned against following the desires of disbelievers, emphasizing that there is no protector against Allah's punishment.</p>

          <h2>Verse 38</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ أَزْوَاجًا وَذُرِّيَّةً ۚ وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِآيَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۗ لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">We have certainly sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ and blessed them with wives and offspring. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s permission. Every destined matter has a ˹set˺ time.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if they say, "What is with you, O Messenger, that you marry women?" Then We have sent before you messengers from mankind, and We gave them spouses and offspring. And if they say, "If he were a messenger, he would have brought what we asked of miracles," then it is not within the power of a messenger to bring a miracle that his people desire except by the permission of Allah. For every matter that Allah has decreed there is a book and a term that Allah has written with Him, it does not precede nor lag.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah sent messengers before the Prophet, who had wives and children. Messengers can only perform miracles with Allah's permission. Every matter has a predetermined time.</p>

          <h2>Verse 39</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ ۖ وَعِنْدَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah eliminates and confirms what He wills, and with Him is the Master Record.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah eliminates what He wills of decrees and other things, and He keeps what He wills of them for a wisdom He knows. And with Him is the Mother of the Book, which is the Preserved Tablet.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah has the power to eliminate or confirm any matter as He wills. The *Master Record* (or *Preserved Tablet*) with Allah contains all decrees.</p>

          <h2>Verse 40</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِنْ مَا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ الَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَاغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. Judgment is for Us.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if We show you - O Messenger - some of the punishment with which We have threatened your enemies, of disgrace and retribution in this world, then that is expedited for them. And if We cause you to die before you see that, then your only duty is to deliver the message, and upon Us is the reckoning and recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Whether the Prophet sees the punishment of the disbelievers or not, his duty is to deliver the message. Allah is the sole Judge, and all will be accountable to Him.</p>

          <h2>Verse 41</h2>
          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا نَأْتِي الْأَرْضَ نَنْقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ لَا مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِ ۚ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Do they not see that We gradually reduce their land from its borders? Allah decides—none can reverse His decision. And He is swift in reckoning.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have not these disbelievers seen that We come to the land, diminishing it from its edges, by the Muslims conquering the lands of the polytheists and annexing them to the lands of the Muslims? And Allah judges; there is no repeller of His judgment and decree, and He is swift in reckoning, so let them not hasten the punishment, for everything that is coming is near.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers are asked if they do not see how their land is being reduced at its borders, a reference to the expansion of the Muslim lands. Allah's judgment is irreversible and swift.</p>

          <h2>Verse 42</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَقَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَلِلَّهِ الْمَكْرُ جَمِيعًا ۖ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ۗ وَسَيَعْلَمُ الْكُفَّارُ لِمَنْ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Those ˹disbelievers˺ before them ˹secretly˺ planned, but Allah has the ultimate plan. He knows what every soul commits. And the disbelievers will soon know who will have the ultimate outcome.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those before them had plotted against their messengers, just as these have done with you, but to Allah belongs all planning, so He nullifies their plots and returns it to them with disappointment and regret. He knows, glory be to Him, what every soul earns of good or evil, so it will be recompensed for it. And the disbelievers will know - when they come before their Lord - to whom the praiseworthy outcome will be after this world. Indeed, it is for the followers of the messengers. And in this is a threat and warning for the disbelievers.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Disbelievers before them plotted against messengers, but Allah's plan is supreme. He knows what every soul commits, and disbelievers will realize the praiseworthy outcome is for the followers of the messengers.</p>

          <h2>Verse 43</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَسْتَ مُرْسَلًا ۚ قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ الْكِتَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">The disbelievers say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are no messenger.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you, as is whoever has knowledge of the Scripture.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who disbelieve say to the Prophet of Allah: -O Muhammad- Allah did not send you. Say to them: Sufficient is Allah as a witness to my truthfulness and your falsehood, and sufficient is the testimony of those who have knowledge of the Scripture from the Jews and Christians who believed in my message, and what I have come with from Allah, and followed the truth and declared that testimony, and did not conceal it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the disbelievers' rejection of Prophet Muhammad's message. It asserts that Allah and those with knowledge of previous scriptures serve as witnesses to his truthfulness.</p>
