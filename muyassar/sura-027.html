          <p class="quran-text">So when she arrived, it was said ˹to her˺, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks to be the same. We have ˹already˺ received knowledge ˹of Solomon’s prophethood˺ before this ˹miracle˺, and have submitted ˹to Allah˺.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">When the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon in his court, she was asked, “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It resembles it.” So it became clear to Solomon that she was correct in her answer, and she had realized Allah’s power and the truth of Solomon's prophethood, peace be upon him. He said: “We were given knowledge of Allah and His power before her, and we were submissive to Allah's command, following the religion of Islam.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">Upon arrival, the Queen is questioned about her throne. She recognizes it and admits that she and her people had already received knowledge and submitted to God before this miracle, showcasing her understanding of the situation.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of Allah, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And what used to hinder her from worshipping Allah alone was what she used to worship besides Allah. Indeed, she was an infidel and grew up among an infidel people, continuing in their religion. Otherwise, she possesses enough intelligence and discernment to know the truth from falsehood, but false beliefs remove the insight of the heart.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Queen's prior disbelief was due to her worship of idols, which she had continued from her people. False beliefs blind people from the truth.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And ask them, “Who is it that initiates the creation, then brings it to an end when He wills, then restores it? And who is it that provides for you from the sky by sending down rain, and from the earth by bringing forth vegetation and other things?

          <p class="explanation">This verse challenges the disbelievers to consider who creates, sustains, and provides for them. It questions if any other deity besides Allah has the power to do so, urging them to provide proof of their claims.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better, and they will be secure from the horror on that Day.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Whoever comes with the Oneness of Allah, belief in Him, and worship of Him alone, and righteous deeds on the Day of Resurrection, then for him with Allah is a great reward that is better and superior, and it is Paradise. And they are on the Day of the Greatest Terror, secure.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who come with good deeds, such as belief in Allah and righteous actions, will receive a superior reward and be safe from the terror of the Day of Judgment.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِنَّمَا أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ رَبَّ هَٰذِهِ الْبَلْدَةِ الَّذِي حَرَّمَهَا وَلَهُ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city ˹of Mecca˺, Who has made it sacred, and to Him belongs everything. And I am commanded to be one of those who ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Say - O Messenger - to the people: I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, which is "Mecca," who has made it sacred for His creation, that they should not shed unlawful blood therein, or wrong anyone therein, or hunt its game, or cut its trees. And to Him, the Exalted, belongs everything. And I was commanded to worship Him alone without anyone else. And I was commanded to be among those who submit to His command, those who hasten to obey Him, and to recite the Quran to the people. So whoever is guided by what is in it and follows what I have brought, then indeed, the good of that and its reward is for himself. And whoever goes astray from the truth, then say - O Messenger -: I am only a warner to you of the punishment of Allah and His penalty if you do not believe. So I am one of the messengers who warned their people, and I do not possess any guidance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet is commanded to worship the Lord of Mecca, who made it sacred. Everything belongs to Him, and the Prophet is ordered to be among those who submit to Allah.</p>
