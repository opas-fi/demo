          <p class="quran-text">˹They are˺ the ones who favour the life of this world over the Hereafter and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. It is they who have gone far astray.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And these who turned away and did not believe in Allah and follow His messengers are the ones who choose the fleeting worldly life, and abandon the everlasting Hereafter, and prevent people from following the religion of Allah, and desire it to be a crooked path to suit their desires. Those described with these attributes are in misguidance from the truth, far from all means of guidance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the disbelievers as those who prefer worldly life over the Hereafter, hinder others from the path of Allah, and seek to distort it. They are far astray from guidance.</p>

And they said to their messengers: 'Indeed, we do not believe in that which you have come with, and indeed, we are in doubt about that to which you are calling us of faith and monotheism, causing suspicion.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse recounts stories of past nations, such as the people of Noah, 'Ad, and Thamud, who rejected their messengers despite clear proofs. They disbelieved and expressed doubt about the message.</p>

You ˹only˺ wish to turn us away from what our forefathers worshipped. So bring us some compelling proof.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Their messengers said to them: 'Is there doubt about Allah and His worship - alone - while He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and their originator from nothing without any previous example? And He is calling you to faith so that He may forgive you your sins and postpone your stay in this world until an appointed term, which is the end of your terms, so He will not punish you in this world?' They said to their messengers: 'We see you only as humans like ourselves, having no superiority over us that qualifies you to be messengers. You want to prevent us from worshipping what our fathers used to worship of idols and false deities. So bring us a clear proof that testifies to the truth of what you are saying.'</p>
          <p class="explanation">The messengers question the disbelief in Allah, the Creator of the heavens and earth. They clarify that the messengers were inviting them to seek forgiveness, but the people dismissed them, asking for proof of their prophethood and rejecting the idea of abandoning the worship of their forefathers.</p>

          <h2>Verse 21</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا فَقَالَ الضُّعَفَاءُ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُوا إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُغْنُونَ عَنَّا مِنْ عَذَابِ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ قَالُوا لَوْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ لَهَدَيْنَاكُمْ ۖ سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْنَا أَجَزِعْنَا أَمْ صَبَرْنَا مَا لَنَا مِنْ مَحِيصٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you ˹then˺ protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the creatures will come out of their graves, and they will all appear on the Day of Resurrection before Allah, the One, the All-Dominating; to judge between them. Then the followers will say to their leaders: Indeed, we were your followers in the world, following your commands, so are you – today – going to ward off from us any of the punishment of Allah as you used to promise us? Then the leaders will say: If Allah had guided us to faith, we would have guided you to it, but He did not grant us success, so we went astray and caused you to go astray. It is equal upon us, both the lamenting and the patience, for we have no escape from the punishment nor refuge.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Judgment, followers will ask their leaders for help, but the leaders will admit their own helplessness and misguidance. No one can escape the consequences of their deeds.</p>

          <h2>Verse 22</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدْتُكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ إِلَّا أَنْ دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي ۖ فَلَا تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ ۖ مَا أَنَا بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِيَّ ۖ إِنِّي كَفَرْتُ بِمَا أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِنْ قَبْلُ ۗ إِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And Satan will say - after Allah has completed the matter and settled accounts with His creation, and the people of Paradise have entered Paradise and the people of Hell have entered Hell -: Indeed, Allah promised you a true promise of the resurrection and the recompense, and I promised you a false promise that there is no resurrection and no recompense, so I broke my promise to you. And I had no power over you to force you to follow me, nor did I have any proof, but I called you to disbelief and misguidance, and you followed me, so do not blame me, but blame yourselves, for the sin is yours. I cannot save you, nor can you save me from the punishment of Allah. Indeed, I disavow your making me a partner with Allah in obedience in this world. Indeed, the wrongdoers - in their turning away from the truth and their following of falsehood - will have a painful and agonizing punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Satan will admit his deception and powerlessness, stating he only called people to misguidance, and they followed him freely. He will emphasize that people should blame themselves, not him.</p>

          <h2>Verse 42</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَافِلًا عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّالِمُونَ ۚ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الْأَبْصَارُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them until a Day when ˹their˺ eyes will stare in horror—</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And never think, [O Messenger], that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do - of denying you and other messengers, harming the believers, and other acts of disobedience. He only delays their punishment until a day severe, in which their eyes will be raised and will not blink due to the horror of what they see. And in this is consolation for the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse cautions against the assumption that Allah is unaware of the wrongdoings of the transgressors. It explains that their punishment is delayed to a day when their eyes will be wide open in horror. This provides solace to the Prophet.</p>

          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the Day of Judgment, where wrongdoers will emerge from their graves with their heads raised and eyes unseeing due to the terror, and their hearts will be empty from intense fear.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And warn the people of the Day when the punishment will overtake ˹the wicked among˺ them, and the wrongdoers will cry, “Our Lord! Delay us for a little while. We will respond to Your call and follow the messengers!” ˹It will be said,˺ “Did you not swear before that you would never be removed ˹to the next life˺?”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And warn - O Messenger - the people to whom I sent you about the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. And at that time, those who wronged themselves with disbelief will say, “Our Lord, grant us respite for a short time so we may believe in You and obey Your messengers.” It will be said to them reproachfully, “Did you not swear in your lives that there would be no end for you from this worldly life to the Hereafter? Yet, you did not believe in this resurrection?”</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse warns of the Day when punishment will overtake the wicked. They will plead for a short delay to believe and follow the messengers, but will be rebuked for previously denying the afterlife.</p>
