          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ وَلَا تُطِعِ الْكَافِرِينَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O Prophet! ˹Always˺ be mindful of Allah, and do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O Prophet, persevere in fearing Allah by acting upon His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, and let the believers follow your example, for they are more in need of that than you. And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of all things, Wise in His creation, command, and planning.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse advises Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to remain mindful of Allah and not to obey disbelievers and hypocrites. It emphasizes Allah’s knowledge and wisdom.</p>

          <p class="arabic">مَا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِنْ قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ ۚ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَاجَكُمُ اللَّائِي تُظَاهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ ۚ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَاءَكُمْ أَبْنَاءَكُمْ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُمْ بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ ۖ وَاللَّهُ يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِي السَّبِيلَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah does not place two hearts in any person’s chest. Nor does He regard your wives as ˹unlawful for you like˺ your real mothers, ˹even˺ if you say they are. Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real children. These are only your baseless assertions. But Allah declares the truth, and He ˹alone˺ guides to the ˹Right˺ Way.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his chest, nor has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers (in prohibition) (and 'Zihar' is when a man says to his wife, 'You are to me like the back of my mother,' and this used to be considered a divorce in the pre-Islamic era, so Allah clarified that a wife does not become a mother in any situation). And Allah has not made adopted sons actual sons in the law, rather Zihar and adoption have no reality in perpetual prohibition. So a wife from whom Zihar is made is not like a mother in prohibition, nor is lineage established through adoption from a person saying to an adopted one, 'This is my son.' It is speech from the mouth that has no reality and is not taken into account, and Allah, the Exalted, says the truth and clarifies His path for His servants and guides them to the path of righteousness.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that Allah has not given any person two hearts, nor does saying your wife is like your mother make her so, and adopted children are not like real children. Allah clarifies the truth and guides to the right path.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Let your adopted children keep their family names. That is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are ˹simply˺ your fellow believers and close associates. There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but ˹only˺ for what you do intentionally. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Ascribe your adopted children to their fathers; that is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their true fathers, then they are your brothers in religion and your allies in it. And there is no blame upon you for what you mistakenly did, but Allah will hold you accountable if you do so intentionally. And Allah is Forgiving to those who err, Merciful to those who repent from their sins.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs that adopted children should be known by their biological fathers' names. If the fathers are unknown, they are considered as brothers in faith. Mistakes are forgiven, but intentional wrongdoings are not. Allah is All-Forgiving and Most Merciful.</p>

          <p class="arabic">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ ۗ وَأُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ إِلَّا أَنْ تَفْعَلُوا إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِكُمْ مَعْرُوفًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">The Prophet has a stronger affinity to the believers than they do themselves. And his wives are their mothers. As ordained by Allah, blood relatives are more entitled ˹to inheritance˺ than ˹other˺ believers and immigrants, unless you ˹want to˺ show kindness to your ˹close˺ associates ˹through bequest˺. This is decreed in the Record.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is more worthy of the believers and closer to them than their own selves in matters of religion and worldly affairs. And the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, are as inviolable to his nation as their own mothers, so it is not permissible to marry the wives of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, after him. And blood relatives among Muslims are more entitled to inherit from one another in Allah’s rule and law than inheritance through faith and emigration (and the Muslims in the beginning of Islam used to inherit through emigration and faith without blood relation, then that was abrogated by the verse of inheritance), unless you do - O Muslims - a good deed to those who are not heirs through support, righteousness, kinship, beneficence, and bequest. This mentioned ruling has been decreed and written in the Preserved Tablet, so it is obligatory for you to act according to it. And in the verse is the obligation of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, being more beloved to a servant than his own self, and the obligation of complete submission to him, and in it is the obligation of respecting the mothers of the believers, his wives, peace and blessings be upon him, and that whoever insults them has brought upon himself loss.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights that the Prophet (peace be upon him) has a stronger connection with believers than they do with themselves, and his wives are regarded as mothers of the believers. Blood relatives have priority in inheritance, except for acts of kindness towards others. These rules are ordained by Allah.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And remember - O Prophet - when We took from the prophets their solemn pledge to deliver the message, and We took the covenant from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary (and they are the ones of steadfast resolve among the messengers according to the well-known view), and We took from them a solemn pledge to deliver the message and fulfill the trust, and to confirm each other.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights the covenant Allah took from the prophets, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them all), emphasizing their responsibility to deliver the divine message faithfully.</p>

And Allah is ever Seeing of what you do, nothing of that is hidden from Him.</p>

But when the war ends and the terror is gone, they lash out at you with sharp, hurtful tongues, and you see them stingy and envious when the spoils are divided. Those have not believed in their hearts, so Allah has nullified their deeds, and that is easy for Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes the behavior of hypocrites: they are unwilling to help, show fear during conflict, and are greedy after the danger is gone. Their actions render their deeds void because they lack true faith.</p>

          <p class="arabic">يَحْسَبُونَ الْأَحْزَابَ لَمْ يَذْهَبُوا ۖ وَإِنْ يَأْتِ الْأَحْزَابُ يَوَدُّوا لَوْ أَنَّهُمْ بَادُونَ فِي الْأَعْرَابِ يَسْأَلُونَ عَنْ أَنْبَائِكُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ كَانُوا فِيكُمْ مَا قَاتَلُوا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They ˹still˺ think that the enemy alliance has not ˹yet˺ withdrawn. And if the allies were to come ˹again˺, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the desert among nomadic Arabs, ˹only˺ asking for news about you ˹believers˺. And if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the fight.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The hypocrites think that the confederates whom Allah defeated utterly have not gone away; that is because of extreme fear and cowardice. And if the confederates were to return to “Medina,” those hypocrites would wish that they were absent from “Medina” among the bedouins of the desert, inquiring about your news and asking about your reports. And even if they were among you, they would not fight with you except a little because of their great cowardice, humiliation, and weakness of certainty.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse shows that hypocrites are in constant fear, wishing to be away from conflict. They are cowardly and would barely participate in fighting, even if they were present.</p>
