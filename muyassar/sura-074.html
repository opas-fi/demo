          <p class="muyassar">He thought to himself and prepared what he would say to criticize Muhammad and the Quran, so he was cursed, and by that, he deserved destruction. How did he prepare this criticism in his mind? Then he was cursed again. Then he reflected on what he planned and prepared to criticize the Quran. Then he frowned, and became stern in his scowling and frowning when his tricks failed and he found no fault with which to criticize the Quran. Then he turned away from the truth and became too arrogant to acknowledge it, and said about the Quran: "This that Muhammad says is but magic transmitted from the ancients. This is nothing but the words of the created beings, which Muhammad learned from them, then claimed it was from Allah."</p>

          <p class="quran-text">We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have made their number only as a test for the disbelievers, so that the People of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith, and neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts, and so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this way Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description of Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We have not appointed the keepers of the Fire except angels, and We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve in Allah; and so that those who were given the Scripture, from Jews and Christians, may be certain that what came in the Quran about the keepers of Hell is indeed a truth from Allah, since that matches their books, and so that the believers may increase in conviction in Allah and His Messenger and by practicing his law, and those who were given the Scripture, from Jews and Christians, and the believers in Allah and His Messenger will not doubt in that; and so that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers may say: "What does Allah intend by this strange number?" Thus Allah leaves to stray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills, and none knows the hosts of your Lord - including the angels - except Allah alone. And the Fire is but a reminder and a warning to the people.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The number of Hell's keepers serves as a test of faith for disbelievers, reinforces belief for those who have it, and creates doubt among hypocrites. The true number of God's forces remains known only to Him, and the description of hell serves as a reminder.</p>

          <p class="arabic">بَلْ يُرِيدُ كُلُّ امْرِئٍ مِنْهُمْ أَنْ يُؤْتَىٰ صُحُفًا مُنَشَّرَةً</p>
          <p class="quran-text">In fact, each one of them wishes to be given a ˹personal˺ letter ˹from Allah˺ for all ˹to read˺.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Rather, every one of these polytheists desires that Allah should send down to him a book from the sky, unfolded, as He sent down to Muhammad, peace be upon him. The matter is not as they claim, but the truth is that they do not fear the Hereafter, nor do they believe in the resurrection and the recompense.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The disbelievers desire a personal letter from Allah, revealed to them directly, instead of acknowledging the Quran revealed to Prophet Muhammad. This shows their lack of sincerity.</p>
