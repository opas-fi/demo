          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ وَقَدْ كَفَرُوا بِمَا جَاءَكُمْ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۙ أَنْ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ خَرَجْتُمْ جِهَادًا فِي سَبِيلِي وَابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِي ۚ تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ بِمَا أَخْفَيْتُمْ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُمْ ۚ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْهُ مِنْكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Do not take My enemies and yours as trusted allies, showing them affection even though they deny what has come to you of the truth. They drove the Messenger and yourselves out ˹of Mecca˺, simply for your belief in Allah, your Lord. If you ˹truly˺ emigrated to struggle in My cause and seek My pleasure, ˹then do not take them as allies,˺ disclosing secrets ˹of the believers˺ to the pagans out of affection for them, when I know best whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. And whoever of you does this has truly strayed from the Right Way.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies and loved ones, extending to them affection, informing them of the news of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the rest of the Muslims, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth from belief in Allah and His Messenger and what was revealed to him from the Quran. They expel the Messenger and expel you - O believers - from "Mecca" because you believe in Allah, your Lord, and unite Him. If you - O believers - have emigrated striving in My cause, seeking My pleasure with you, then do not befriend My enemies and your enemies, extending to them affection secretly, and I know what you conceal and what you reveal, and whoever does that among you has strayed from the path of truth and rectitude, and deviated from the intended path.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse prohibits believers from forming close alliances with those who oppose Allah and the truth. It reminds them that true loyalty should be to Allah, especially if they emigrated for His sake. Sharing secrets with enemies is a betrayal of this loyalty.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِنْ يَثْقَفُوكُمْ يَكُونُوا لَكُمْ أَعْدَاءً وَيَبْسُطُوا إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِالسُّوءِ وَوَدُّوا لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">If they gain the upper hand over you, they would be your ˹open˺ enemies, unleashing their hands and tongues to harm you, and wishing that you would abandon faith.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If those to whom you secretly extend affection prevail over you, they will be enemies to you, and they will extend their hands to you with killing and captivity, and their tongues with insults and abuse, and they have wished - in any case - that you would disbelieve like them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the enemies of believers gain power, they would openly act hostile. They would harm them physically and verbally, and their ultimate goal would be to make them abandon their faith.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Neither your relatives nor children will benefit you on Judgment Day—He will decide between you ˹all˺. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you at all when you ally with the disbelievers for their sake. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will separate you, admitting those who obeyed Him to Paradise, and those who disobeyed Him to Hell. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do, nothing of your words and deeds is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Judgment, family ties and relationships will not help anyone who allied with disbelievers. Allah will judge everyone based on their actions and beliefs.</p>

          <h2>Verse 4</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُوا لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَآءُ مِنْكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ إِلَّا قَوْلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ لَأَسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ وَمَا أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۖ رَبَّنَا عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">You already have an excellent example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We totally dissociate ourselves from you and ˹shun˺ whatever ˹idols˺ you worship besides Allah. We reject you. The enmity and hatred that has arisen between us and you will last until you believe in Allah alone.” The only exception is when Abraham said to his father, “I will seek forgiveness for you,˹” adding, “but˺ I cannot protect you from Allah at all.” ˹The believers prayed,˺ “Our Lord! In You we trust. And to You we ˹always˺ turn. And to You is the final return.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">There has been for you - O believers - an excellent example in Abraham, peace be upon him, and those with him from the believers, when they said to their people who disbelieved in Allah, "Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from what you worship besides Allah of gods and rivals. We disbelieve in you and reject what you are upon of disbelief, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever as long as you remain upon your disbelief, until you believe in Allah alone." But the seeking of forgiveness by Abraham for his father does not enter into the example; for that was only before it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned in repentance, and to You is the return on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Prophet Abraham and his followers are an excellent example of believers who disassociated themselves from disbelievers and their idolatry. They declared their enmity until the disbelievers believe in Allah alone. Abraham's request for forgiveness for his father is an exception, as it was before his disbelief became clear.</p>

          <p class="arabic">رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا رَبَّنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Our Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the disbelievers. Forgive us, our Lord! You ˹alone˺ are truly the Almighty, All-Wise.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Our Lord, do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve by Your torment of us or by empowering the disbelievers over us, so they may tempt us away from our religion, or they may prevail over us and be tempted by that, and say: "If these were upon truth, this torment would not have befallen them," and they would increase in disbelief. And conceal our sins with Your forgiveness for them, our Lord, indeed You are the Almighty who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His words and actions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse contains a prayer asking Allah to protect believers from being persecuted by disbelievers and to forgive their sins. It recognizes Allah as the All-Powerful and All-Wise.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">You certainly have an excellent example in them for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day. But whoever turns away, then surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, there was for you - O believers - in Abraham, peace be upon him, and those with him, a good example for whoever hopes for good from Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And whoever turns away from what Allah has urged him to do by emulating His prophets and allies himself with the enemies of Allah, then Allah is the Self-Sufficient from His servants, the Praiseworthy in His Essence and Attributes, the One who is Praised in every situation.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The actions of Prophet Abraham and his companions serve as an excellent example for believers who seek Allah's pleasure and the rewards of the Hereafter. Those who turn away from this guidance will not harm Allah, as He is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">˹In time,˺ Allah may bring about goodwill between you and those of them you ˹now˺ hold as enemies. For Allah is Most Capable. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is hoped that Allah will place between you - O believers - and those you have shown hostility towards among your relatives who are polytheists, affection after hatred, and harmony after animosity by opening their hearts to Islam. And Allah is Powerful over all things, and Allah is Forgiving of His servants, Merciful towards them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah has the power to transform animosity into goodwill between believers and their former enemies, particularly among family. Allah is All-Forgiving and Merciful, always willing to guide and reconcile.</p>

Indeed, Allah loves those who are just in their words and actions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Believers are not forbidden from treating non-believers with kindness and fairness, especially those who haven't fought or expelled them from their homes. Allah loves those who act justly.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! When the believing women come to you as emigrants, test their intentions—their faith is best known to Allah—and if you find them to be believers, then do not send them back to the disbelievers. These ˹women˺ are not lawful ˹wives˺ for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful ˹husbands˺ for them. ˹But˺ repay the disbelievers whatever ˹dowries˺ they had paid. And there is no blame on you if you marry these ˹women˺ as long as you pay them their dowries. And do not hold on to marriage with polytheistic women. ˹But˺ demand ˹repayment of˺ whatever ˹dowries˺ you had paid, and let the disbelievers do the same. That is the judgment of Allah—He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when the believing women come to you as emigrants from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, then test them, so that you may know the truth of their faith. Allah is more knowing of the reality of their faith, but if you know them to be believers according to what appears to you from the signs and clear evidences, then do not return them to their disbelieving husbands. For the believing women are not lawful for them to marry the disbelievers, nor is it lawful for the disbelievers to marry the believing women. And give their (previous) husbands what they have spent on them of dowries, and there is no sin upon you that you marry them if you give them their dowries. And do not hold on to the marriage ties with your disbelieving wives, and demand from the polytheists what you have spent of dowries for your women who have turned away from Islam and joined them, and let them demand what they have spent of dowries for their Muslim women who have embraced Islam and joined you. That aforementioned ruling in the verse is the judgment of Allah by which He judges between you, so do not oppose it. And Allah is Knowing, nothing is hidden from Him, Wise in His words and actions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When believing women migrate to the Muslim community, their faith should be tested. If they are indeed believers, they cannot be returned to their disbelieving husbands. The dowry paid should be returned to the disbelievers, and believers are allowed to marry such women. Marriages to polytheistic women are forbidden. This is Allah's judgement, and He is All-Knowing and All-Wise.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And if some of your wives turn back as apostates to the disbelievers, and the disbelievers do not give you their dowries that you paid to them, then if you gain victory over those disbelievers or others and you are victorious over them, then give those whose wives have left, from the Muslims, from the spoils of war or other things, the like of what they gave them of dowries before that, and fear Allah in whom you are believers.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If wives of believers apostatize and go to the disbelievers and their dowries were not returned, then the believers have the right to retrieve the equivalent value of the dowries when they gain spoils of war. Believers must remain mindful of Allah.</p>

Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His repentant servants, Merciful to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the pledge that believing women make to the Prophet Muhammad, committing to avoid idolatry, theft, adultery, infanticide, and false claims of lineage, and to obey him in what is right.
