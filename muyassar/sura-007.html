          <p class="muyassar">This Quran is a great book that Allah has revealed to you - O Messenger - so let there be no doubt in your heart that it was revealed from Allah, and do not hesitate in conveying it and warning with it. We have revealed it to you so that you may warn the disbelievers and remind the believers.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And many a town We destroyed its people because of their opposition to Our messengers and their denial of them, which resulted in the disgrace of this world followed by the humiliation of the Hereafter. So Our punishment came to them once while they were sleeping at night and once while they were sleeping during the day. Allah specified these two times because they are times of tranquility and rest, so the coming of the punishment at these times is more awful and severe.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse mentions that many communities were destroyed when they rejected messengers. The punishment came to them unexpectedly, either at night or midday.</p>

Iblis said: "I am better than him in creation; for I was created from fire, and he was created from clay." So he saw that fire is more noble than clay.</p>

And their Lord, Majestic and Exalted, called out to them, "Did I not forbid you from eating from that tree, and did I not say to you: indeed, Satan is to you a clear enemy?" And in this verse is evidence that the uncovering of the private parts is of the great matters, and that it was and still is reprehensible in human nature, and ugly to the minds.</p>

Indeed, Satan sees you, he and his progeny and his kind, while you do not see them, so beware of them.

The messengers of our Lord came with the truth of informing about the promise to His obedient ones and the threat to His disobedient ones, and they were called out, congratulating and honoring them: This is the Paradise that Allah has bequeathed to you by His mercy, and by what you have presented of faith and righteous deeds.</p>

These are signs from the signs of Allah, which none other than Him can bring about, separated one from another. Yet, with all this, the people of Pharaoh were arrogant, and they were too proud to believe in Allah, and they were a people doing what Allah forbade them of sins and wickedness, in stubbornness and defiance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah sent clear signs as plagues, including floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood, to demonstrate His power. Despite these signs, Pharaoh and his people remained arrogant and wicked.</p>

When he recovered from his faint, he said: “Exalted are You, O Lord, above what does not befit Your majesty. I repent to You from my asking You for the vision in this worldly life, and I am the first of the believers in You from my people.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">When Moses met with Allah, he asked to see Him. Allah replied that he could not see Him in this world and showed His glory to a mountain instead, causing it to crumble. Moses then repented and affirmed his faith.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Upon Moses’ return to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me and˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when Moses returned to his people, the Children of Israel, angry and grieved, because Allah had informed him that his people had been tested and that the Samiri had led them astray, Moses said, “What a bad succession you have left me after my departure. Did you hasten the command of your Lord?” Meaning: Did you hasten my coming to you, which was ordained by Allah Almighty? And Moses threw down the tablets of the Torah in anger at his people who worshiped the calf, and in anger at his brother Aaron, and he seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. Aaron, pleading, said: “O son of my mother, indeed, the people weakened me, considered me weak and were about to kill me. So do not please the enemies with what you are doing to me, and do not place me in your anger with the people who disobeyed your command and worshiped the calf.”</p>
          <p class="explanation">Upon returning and seeing his people worshipping the calf, Moses was angry. He questioned their actions and, in his anger, grabbed his brother Aaron. Aaron pleaded, explaining he was overpowered and asking not to be grouped with the wrongdoers.</p>

And when they came to that place, they said: “We will not believe you, O Moses, until we see Allah openly, for you have spoken to Him, so show Him to us.” So, the severe earthquake seized them and they died. Then Moses stood imploring Allah and saying: “My Lord, what shall I say to the Children of Israel if I come to them, and You have destroyed their best? If You had willed, You would have destroyed them all before this situation and I with them, for that would be easier for me. Will you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This deed that my people have done by worshiping the calf is but a trial and test; You lead astray thereby whom You will of Your creation, and You guide thereby whom You will to be guided.

So Allah tested them and tried them; their fish would come to them on the Sabbath day in abundance, floating on the surface of the sea, and when the Sabbath day was over, the fish would go into the sea, and they would see nothing of them. So they would trick by confining them on the Sabbath day in pits, and they would fish them afterwards.

          <p class="arabic">فَلَمَّا نَسُوا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ أَنْجَيْنَا الَّذِينَ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ السُّوءِ وَأَخَذْنَا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا بِعَذَابٍ بَئِيسٍ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So when the group that transgressed on the Sabbath abandoned what they were reminded of, and persisted in their error and transgression on it, and did not respond to what the advising group preached to them, Allah saved those who forbade disobedience to Him, and seized those who transgressed on the Sabbath with a painful severe punishment; because of their disobedience to Allah's command and their departure from His obedience.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When the Sabbath-breakers ignored the warnings, Allah saved those who had been advising them. Those who persisted in their disobedience were punished for their rebelliousness.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Then there came after those whom We described, a bad succession who inherited the Book from their predecessors, so they recited it and knew it, but they violated its ruling, taking what was offered to them of the goods of this world from base earnings such as bribery and the like; that is because of their intense greed and appetite, and they say along with that: “Indeed, Allah will forgive us our sins,” making false hopes upon Allah, and if there comes to these Jews some fleeting goods of the forbidden kinds, they take it and deem it lawful, persisting in their sins and their indulgence in the unlawful. Has not the covenant been taken from these to uphold the Torah and act upon what is in it, and not to say about Allah except the truth, and not to lie about Him, and they knew what was in the Book but they neglected it, and abandoned working by it, and violated Allah's covenant with them in that? And the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, by fulfilling His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. Do not those who take the base earnings understand that what is with Allah is better and more lasting for the God-fearing?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Later generations inherited the scriptures but pursued worldly gains. They falsely hoped for forgiveness while continuing to sin. They were reminded of their covenant to speak the truth and that the Hereafter is better for those who are mindful of Allah.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And remember - O Prophet - when your Lord extracted the descendants of Adam from the loins of their fathers, and made them acknowledge His Oneness by what He deposited in their nature that He is their Lord, their Creator, and their Sovereign, so they acknowledged that to Him, fearing that they might deny it on the Day of Resurrection, and not acknowledge anything in it, and claim that Allah's proof did not stand against them, nor did they have knowledge of it, but rather they were heedless of it.</p>

So the example of this man is like that of a dog; if you drive it away or leave it alone, it still pants in both cases. Likewise, the one who has withdrawn himself from the verses of Allah remains in his disbelief whether you strive in your invitation to him or neglect him. This description - O Messenger - is the description of those people who were misguided before you came to them with guidance and the message, so relate - O Messenger - the news of the past nations, for in your informing of that is the greatest miracle, so that your people may reflect on what you have brought to them and believe in you.</p>

          <p class="arabic">أَوَلَمْ يَنْظُرُوا فِي مَلَكُوتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِنْ شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىٰ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدِ اقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ ۖ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have those who deny the signs of Allah not looked at the great dominion of Allah and His overpowering authority in the heavens and the earth, and at what Allah, may His praise be glorified, has created within them, so they may reflect upon that and consider it, and look at their appointed times which may be near, then perish in their disbelief, and be brought to the punishment of Allah and His painful retribution? So after the warning of the Quran, by which intimidation and warning will they believe and act?</p>
          <p class="explanation">People should contemplate the wonders of creation, the heavens, and the earth, and be mindful of their approaching end. If they do not believe in the Quran, what message will they believe in?</p>

It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The disbelievers of "Mecca" ask you, O Messenger, about the Hour, when is its occurrence? Say to them: knowledge of its occurrence is with Allah. No one will reveal it except Him. Its knowledge is heavy and concealed from the people of the heavens and the earth, so neither a close angel nor a sent prophet knows the time of its occurrence. The Hour will only come unexpectedly. These people ask you about it as if you are eager to know it, persistent in asking about it. Say to them: Its knowledge is only with Allah, who knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth, but most people do not know that only Allah knows that.</p>

Then, when he cohabited with her - and the intent is the pair of descendants of Adam - she carried a light load and went about with it. When her time of delivery drew near and her load became heavy, the pair called upon their Lord: “If You grant us a healthy and righteous child, we will surely be among the thankful for what you have bestowed upon us of a righteous offspring."</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah created humanity from a single soul (Adam) and his spouse (Eve). When a couple feels the burden of pregnancy they should pray for a healthy offspring and promise gratitude to Allah.</p>

Or do they have ears with which they hear and inform you of what you have not heard? If your gods, whom you worship, do not possess any of these faculties, then what is the basis for your worship of them, when they are devoid of these things through which benefit can be brought or harm averted? Say - O Messenger - to these polytheists, the worshippers of idols: Call upon your gods whom you have made partners with Allah in worship, then gather together to inflict evil and harm on me, and give me no respite in that, for I do not care about your gods, due to my reliance on the protection of Allah alone.</p>
