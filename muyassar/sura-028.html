Indeed, We will return your son to you and send him as a messenger." So she put him in a box and cast him into the Nile, and Pharaoh's aides found him and took him. The consequence of that was that Allah made him an enemy and a sorrow for them, and their destruction was at his hand. Indeed, Pharaoh, Haman, and their aides were sinful polytheists.</p>

There he found two men fighting: one of his people from the Children of Israel and the other from the people of Pharaoh. The one from Moses' people asked for his help against his enemy. So Moses struck him with his fist, and he died. Moses said when he killed him, "This is from the doing of Satan, who stirred up my anger, until I struck this man and he perished. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the son of Adam, leading him astray from the path of guidance, an open enemy.” And this action by Moses, peace be upon him, was before his prophethood.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And when he arrived at the water of "Madyan", he found a group of people watering their livestock, and he found apart from that group two women separate from the people, holding back their sheep from the water because of their inability and weakness to jostle with the men, and they were waiting until the people's livestock had finished, then they would water their livestock. When Moses -peace be upon him- saw them, he felt compassion for them, then he said: What is your situation? They said: We cannot jostle with the men, and we do not water until the people water, and our father is an old man who cannot water his livestock due to his weakness and old age.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Upon arriving at Midian's well, Moses found people watering their herds. He noticed two women holding back their flock, explaining their inability to compete with the men and their father's old age.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And We certainly gave Moses the Torah after We had destroyed the nations that were before him – such as the people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, the people of Lot, and the dwellers of Madyan – within it were clear insights for the Children of Israel, through which they could discern what would benefit them and what would harm them, and within it was mercy for those among them who acted upon it, so that they may remember the favors of Allah upon them, and be grateful for them, and not deny Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">God revealed the Scripture (Torah) to Moses after destroying previous disbelieving nations. The Scripture was given as guidance and mercy so that people would remember and be mindful of God.</p>

They claimed, “Both ˹Scriptures˺ are works of magic, supporting each other!” Adding, “We truly deny both.”</p>

Say, [O Messenger], to them: Did not the Jews disbelieve in what Moses was given before? They said: In the Torah and the Quran, there are two magics that cooperated in their magic, and they said: We are disbelievers in both of them.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Whoever comes on the Day of Resurrection with sincere devotion to the oneness of Allah and with righteous deeds according to what Allah has prescribed, will have a great reward better than that. And that good is Paradise and eternal bliss. And whoever comes with evil deeds, then those who did evil deeds will only be recompensed for what they used to do.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who come with good deeds will receive a better reward, while those who come with evil deeds will be recompensed for what they have done, highlighting the justice of Allah's judgment on the Day of Resurrection.</p>

          <h2>Verse 85</h2>
          <p class="arabic">إِنَّ الَّذِي فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْآنَ لَرَادُّكَ إِلَىٰ مَعَادٍ ۚ قُلْ رَبِّي أَعْلَمُ مَنْ جَاءَ بِالْهُدَىٰ وَمَنْ هُوَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Most certainly, the One Who has ordained the Quran for you will ˹ultimately˺ bring you back home ˹to Mecca˺. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance and who is clearly astray.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, the One who has sent down the Quran to you, O Messenger, and made it obligatory for you to convey and adhere to it, will return you to the place you came from, which is "Mecca." Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: My Lord knows best who has come with guidance and who is in clear error from the truth.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The One who revealed the Quran to you, O Prophet, will surely bring you back to your home, Mecca. Allah knows best who is truly guided and who is astray.</p>
