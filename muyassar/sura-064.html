And Allah was not in need ˹of their faith˺. For Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">That is what befell them in this world, and what will befall them in the Hereafter, because their messengers from Allah came to them with clear signs and evident miracles, so they said, denying: 'Are mere mortals like us going to guide us?' So they disbelieved in Allah and denied the message of His messengers, and turned away from the truth, not accepting it. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, and Allah is Rich, He has the complete and absolute richness. Praiseworthy in His words, His actions and His attributes. He does not care about them, and their straying does not harm Him at all.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When messengers came with clear proofs, they rejected the message, asking if mere mortals could guide them. Allah is Self-Sufficient and doesn't need them.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Remember the Day of Gathering, the day on which Allah will gather the first and the last. That is the day on which loss and disparity will appear among the creation, and the believers will gain over the disbelievers and the wicked. So the people of faith will enter Paradise by the mercy of Allah, and the people of disbelief will enter Hell by the justice of Allah. And whoever believes in Allah and acts in obedience to Him, He will erase his sins and admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That eternity in Paradise is the great success, after which there is no success.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Gathering, people will realize their losses and gains. Those who believe and do good will have their sins forgiven and enter gardens, that is the ultimate triumph.</p>
