          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِي إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمَا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, Allah has heard the argument of the woman who pleaded with you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning her husband, and appealed to Allah. Allah has heard your exchange. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah has heard the statement of Khawlah bint Tha'labah, who argued about her husband Aws ibn as-Samit, and regarding what he uttered in her case concerning Zihar, which is his saying to her: "You are to me like my mother's back," meaning in the prohibition of marriage, while she was imploring Allah Almighty to relieve her distress. And Allah hears your conversation and your argument. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing of every statement, All-Seeing of everything, nothing is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights Allah's awareness and attentiveness to the complaints of a woman regarding her husband's words. It emphasizes that Allah hears all and sees all, and is aware of our private matters.</p>

          <h2>Verse 2</h2>
          <p class="arabic">الَّذِينَ يُظَاهِرُونَ مِنْكُمْ مِنْ نِسَائِهِمْ مَا هُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِهِمْ ۖ إِنْ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ إِلَّا اللَّائِي وَلَدْنَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَقُولُونَ مُنْكَرًا مِنَ الْقَوْلِ وَزُورًا ۚ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Those of you who ˹sinfully˺ divorce their wives by comparing them to their mothers ˹should know that˺ their wives are in no way their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them. What they say is certainly detestable and false. Yet Allah is truly Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Those who pronounce Zihar among you to their wives - where a man says to his wife, "You are to me like my mother's back" - meaning in the prohibition of marriage - they have disobeyed Allah and violated the law. Their wives are not their mothers in reality, but they are their wives. Their mothers are only those who gave them birth. And indeed, these pronouncers of Zihar are saying a false and terrible statement, the validity of which is not known. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to whoever has committed some violations, and then rectified them with sincere repentance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the practice of 'Zihar,' where a man compares his wife to his mother. It clarifies that such a comparison is false and unacceptable in Islam, but Allah is forgiving for those who repent.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Those who divorce their wives in this manner, then ˹wish to˺ retract what they said, must free a slave before they touch each other. This ˹penalty˺ is meant to deter you. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And those who forbid their wives to themselves through Zihar, and then retract their statement and resolve to have intercourse with their wives, then the expiation for this pronouncement falls on the husband- in this case, and that is the freeing of a believing slave, male or female, before he has intercourse with his wife whom he had declared as forbidden. That is Allah's ruling concerning who pronounces Zihar to his wife, you are admonished by it, O believers, so that you do not fall into Zihar and false statements, and to atone if you do fall into it, and not to return to it. And Allah is not unaware of anything from your deeds, and He will recompense you for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the expiation for 'Zihar,' requiring the freeing of a slave before intimacy is resumed. This is to act as a deterrent.  Allah is aware of all actions.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">But if the husband cannot afford this, let him then fast two consecutive months before the couple touch each other. But if he is unable ˹to fast˺, then let him feed sixty poor people. This is to re-affirm your faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And whoever does not find a slave to free, then he must fast for two consecutive months before he has intercourse with his wife. And whoever cannot fast for two months due to a legitimate excuse, then he must feed sixty poor people enough to satisfy them. That which we have made clear to you concerning the rulings of Zihar is in order that you believe in Allah and follow His Messenger and act upon what Allah has prescribed, and abandon what you were upon in your ignorance. And those mentioned rulings are the commands and limits of Allah, so do not transgress them. And for those who deny them, there is a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If freeing a slave is not possible, then fasting for two consecutive months is required before resuming intimacy. If that is not possible, feeding sixty poor people. These are the limits set by Allah, and those who deny will receive severe punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Indeed, those who defy Allah and His Messenger will be debased, just like those before them. We have certainly sent down clear revelations. And the disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger and disobey their command have been humiliated and disgraced, just as those before them from the nations who opposed Allah and His Messengers were humiliated.

          <p class="quran-text">On the Day Allah resurrects them all together, He will then inform them of what they have done. Allah has kept account of it all, while they have forgotten it. For Allah is a Witness over all things.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Do you not know that Allah the Exalted knows everything in the heavens and the earth? There is no secret consultation of three of His creation, but He is their fourth with His knowledge and encompassing, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor less than these mentioned numbers nor more, but He is with them by His knowledge wherever they may be.

And when they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they greet you not as Allah greets you, and say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them—they will burn in it. And what an evil destination!</p>

And if these Jews come to you - O Messenger - for a matter of affairs, they greet you with other than the greeting that Allah has made a greeting for you, saying, "As-sam 'alayk," meaning: "Death be upon you." And they say among themselves: "Why does Allah not punish us for what we say to Muhammad if he is truly a messenger?” Hell is enough for them; they will enter it and suffer its heat. How evil is that destination!</p>

          <p class="arabic">يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهُ جَمِيعًا فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ ۖ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَاذِبُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">On the Day Allah resurrects them all, they will ˹falsely˺ swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking they have something to stand on. Indeed, it is they who are the ˹total˺ liars.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will resurrect the hypocrites all together from their graves alive, and they will swear to Him that they were believers, just as they used to swear to you, O believers, in the world, and they believe that this will benefit them with Allah just as it benefited them in the world with the Muslims. Indeed, they are the ones who are extreme in lying to a degree that no others have reached.</p>
          <p class="explanation">On the Day of Resurrection, hypocrites will swear to Allah that they were believers, just as they did in life, falsely believing it will help them. However, they are the greatest of liars.</p>

          <h2>Verse 22</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آبَاءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">You will never find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day loyal to those who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those ˹believers˺, Allah has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">You will not find, [O Messenger], a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day and act according to what Allah has legislated for them, loving and befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger and disobey their commands, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their relatives. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah has inscribed with faith and strengthened them with support from Him and victory over their enemies in this world, and He will admit them in the Hereafter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein for an extended time that will never cease. Allah has granted them His pleasure, so He will not be displeased with them, and they are pleased with their Lord for what He has given them of honors and high ranks. Those are the party of Allah and His allies, and those are the ones who are the winners of happiness in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">True believers will never prioritize relationships with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they are family. Allah instills faith in the hearts of believers and will reward them with Paradise. They are the party of Allah, and they will be successful.</p>
