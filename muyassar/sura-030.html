          <p class="quran-text">Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might; they cultivated the land and developed it more than these ˹Meccans˺ ever have. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. Allah would have never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have not these deniers of Allah, heedless of the Hereafter, traveled through the land with contemplation and consideration, to see what was the fate of the nations who denied Allah's messengers, such as 'Aad and Thamud? They were stronger than them in body, and more capable of enjoying life, as they cultivated the land, planted it, built palaces, and lived in them, and they developed their world more than the people of "Mecca" developed their world. But their development did not benefit them, nor did their long duration, and their messengers came to them with clear arguments and shining proofs, but they denied them, so Allah destroyed them, and Allah did not wrong them by that destruction, but they wronged themselves with polytheism and disobedience.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse urges people to learn from past civilizations that were destroyed for their disobedience despite their strength. It highlights that past nations’ power did not save them from divine punishment when they rejected their messengers.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Whoever disbelieves, then upon him is the penalty of his disbelief, which is his eternity in the Fire, and whoever believes and does righteous deeds, then for themselves they are preparing the abodes of Paradise, due to their adherence to the obedience of their Lord.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Those who reject faith will face the consequences of their disbelief. In contrast, those who do good deeds will be preparing a place for themselves in Paradise.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And among the signs of Allah, indicating that He is the only true God, without partner, and of His great power, is the sending of the winds before the rain, as bearers of glad tidings by stirring up the clouds, so that souls rejoice at that, and that He may cause you to taste of His mercy by sending down the rain by which the lands and the servants are revived, and that ships may sail in the sea by the command of Allah and His will, and that you may seek His bounty through trade and other means; Allah did that so that you may thank Him for His blessings and worship Him alone.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse highlights some of Allah's signs: He sends winds to bring rain, allows ships to sail, and provides means for people to seek His bounty. These blessings should encourage gratitude.</p>

Then, they came to them with miracles and clear proofs, but most of them disbelieved in their Lord, so We took vengeance on those who earned evil deeds among them, and We destroyed them, and We gave victory to the believers, the followers of the messengers, and that is what We will do with those who deny you if they continue in their denial of you, and do not believe.</p>
