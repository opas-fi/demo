          <p class="quran-text">˹knowing that˺ none should feel secure from their Lord’s punishment—</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Indeed, man was created anxious and greedy. When evil touches him, he is greatly distressed and impatient. And when good touches him, he is stingy and withholding, except for those devoted to prayer who are constant in their prayers at all times and are not distracted from it by anything, and those in whose wealth is a known right that Allah has obligated upon them, which is Zakat for those who ask for help and for those who abstain from asking, and those who believe in the Day of Reckoning and recompense and prepare for it with righteous deeds, and those who are fearful of the punishment of Allah. Indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not to be felt secure from by anyone. And those who guard their chastity from all that Allah has forbidden to them, except from their spouses and those whom their right hands possess, for they are not to be blamed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">They know that no one is completely safe from Allah's punishment.</p>
