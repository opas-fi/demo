          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and from it He created its mate, and through both He spread countless men and women. And be mindful of Allah—in Whose Name you appeal to one another—and ˹honour˺ family ties. Surely Allah is ever Watchful over you.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O mankind, fear Allah and adhere to His commands, and avoid His prohibitions; for He is the One who created you from one soul, which is Adam, peace be upon him, and created from it his mate, which is Eve, and spread from them throughout the earth many men and many women, and be mindful of Allah, by whom you ask of one another, and beware of severing your family ties. Indeed, Allah is watchful over all your conditions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reminds humanity of their common origin from Adam and Eve, urging them to be mindful of Allah and to honor family ties. It emphasizes Allah's watchfulness over everyone.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Give orphans their wealth ˹when they reach maturity˺, and do not exchange your worthless possessions for their valuables, nor cheat them by mixing their wealth with your own. For this would indeed be a great sin.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And give to those whose fathers died while they were under the age of puberty, and you were their guardians, their wealth when they reach the age of puberty, and you see in them the ability to protect their wealth. And do not take the good from their wealth and replace it with the bad from your wealth, and do not mix their wealth with your wealth in order to deceive and consume their wealth. Indeed, whoever dares to do that has committed a great sin.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs guardians to give orphans their wealth when they reach maturity. It forbids the exchange of good for bad or mixing their wealth with the guardians' own, warning against this as a great sin.</p>

          <h2>Verse 3</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تُقْسِطُوا فِي الْيَتَامَىٰ فَانْكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا فَوَاحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلَّا تَعُولُوا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if you fear that you will not be just to the orphan girls under your care by not giving them their dowries like others, then leave them and marry what is lawful for you of women other than them, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then be content with one, or what your right hands possess of slaves. That which has been legislated for you regarding orphan girls and marriage from one to four, or limiting yourself to one, or what your right hands possess, is more likely to prevent injustice and transgression.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse permits men to marry up to four wives, but emphasizes the need for justice and fairness. If there is a fear of not being just, then they should marry only one or be content with their bondwomen to avoid injustice.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Give women ˹you wed˺ their due dowries graciously. But if they waive some of it willingly, then you may enjoy it freely with a clear conscience.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And give the women their dowries, a gift obligatory and a duty incumbent, with a good heart from you. But if they willingly give up to you anything of it, then take it, and dispose of it; it is lawful and good.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs men to give women their dowries willingly and graciously. If a woman chooses to waive some of the dowry, it is permissible to accept it.</p>

          <p class="explanation">This verse advises against entrusting the wealth to those who are incapable of managing it wisely. Instead, guardians should provide for their needs and speak kindly to them.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَابْتَلُوا الْيَتَامَىٰ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغُوا النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَأْكُلُوهَا إِسْرَافًا وَبِدَارًا أَنْ يَكْبَرُوا ۚ وَمَنْ كَانَ غَنِيًّا فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ ۖ وَمَنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُوا عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ حَسِيبًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Test ˹the competence of˺ the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you feel they are capable of sound judgment, return their wealth to them. And do not consume it wastefully and hastily before they grow up ˹to demand it˺. If the guardian is well-off, they should not take compensation; but if the guardian is poor, let them take a reasonable provision. When you give orphans back their property, call in witnesses. And sufficient is Allah as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And test those under your care among the orphans to know their ability to manage their wealth well, until when they reach the age of puberty, and you know of their righteousness in their religion and ability to protect their wealth, then hand it over to them, and do not transgress against it by spending it in the wrong way, wasting it and rushing to consume it before they take it from you. And whoever is wealthy among you, let him abstain with his wealth, and not take anything from the orphan’s wealth, and whoever is poor, let him take according to his need when necessary. So when you know that they are capable of protecting their wealth after reaching puberty, and you have handed it over to them, then have witnesses over them to guarantee that their right has reached them completely so that they do not deny that. And it is sufficient for you that Allah is a witness over you, and holds you accountable for what you have done.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse commands testing orphans' competence until they reach marriageable age. If they are deemed capable, their wealth should be returned. Guardians are not to waste their wealth, and if poor, may take a reasonable amount. Witnesses are to be present when returning the wealth.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Allah commands you regarding your children: the share of the male will be twice that of the female. If you leave only two ˹or more˺ females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring. But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third. But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one-sixth—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. ˹Be fair to˺ your parents and children, as you do not ˹fully˺ know who is more beneficial to you. ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one’s estate; and if there is only one, for her is half. And for one’s parents, to each one of them is a sixth of the estate if he had children. But if he had no children and the parents are his [only] heirs, then for his mother is one third, and for his father is the remainder. And if the deceased had brothers and sisters, two or more, then for the mother is one sixth, and the rest goes to the father, and the siblings get nothing. This division of the inheritance is only after the deceased’s will has been fulfilled to the limit of one third or the payment of any debt. Your parents or your children, you do not know which of them is closer to you in benefit in your worldly life and in the Hereafter, so do not prefer one over the other. This is what Allah has decreed for you. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise in what He has prescribed for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the specific inheritance shares. Males receive double the share of females. Parents receive one-sixth each if there are children. If there are no children, the mother receives one-third, while if there are siblings, she receives one-sixth. These are divinely ordained proportions after any bequests or debts have been settled. The verse underscores that one does not know who is closer in benefit, stressing fairness in inheritance distribution.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">You will inherit half of what your wives leave if they are childless. But if they have children, then ˹your share is˺ one-fourth of the estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. And your wives will inherit one-fourth of what you leave if you are childless. But if you have children, then your wives will receive one-eighth of your estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. And if a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor children but only a brother or a sister ˹from their mother’s side˺, they will each inherit one-sixth, but if they are more than one, they ˹all˺ will share one-third of the estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts without harm ˹to the heirs˺. ˹This is˺ a commandment from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And for you - O men - is half of what your wives leave behind if they have no child, whether male or female. But if they have a child, then for you is a quarter of what they leave, which you inherit after the execution of their permissible will, or what is due from them as debt to its claimants. And for your wives - O men - is a quarter of what you leave if you have no son or daughter from them or from others. But if you have a son or a daughter, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, divided between them. If there is only one wife, then this is her inheritance, after the execution of what you have bequeathed of permissible bequests, or settlement of what is due from you as a debt. And if a man or woman dies and has no child or parent, and has a brother or sister from the mother's side, then for each of them is a sixth. But if the brothers or sisters from the mother's side are more than that, then they are partners in a third, divided among them equally, with no difference between male and female. And this that Allah has prescribed for the brothers and sisters from the mother's side, they take it as inheritance for them after the settlement of the deceased's debts, and the execution of his will if he has made a will that does not harm the heirs. With this, your Lord advises you, a beneficial advice for you. And Allah is Knowing of what is best for His creation, Forbearing, not hastening with punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines inheritance laws for spouses and siblings. Husbands inherit half of their childless wives' estate or one-fourth if children exist, after debts and bequests. Wives inherit one-fourth of their childless husbands' estate or one-eighth if children exist, after debts and bequests. Siblings from the mother's side inherit one-sixth each if only one, or share one-third equally if more than one, after debts and bequests. These are commandments from Allah.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَاللَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَانِهَا مِنْكُمْ فَآذُوهُمَا ۖ فَإِنْ تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُوا عَنْهُمَا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And the two among you who commit this sin—discipline them. If they repent and mend their ways, relieve them. Surely Allah is ever Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And the two who commit it among you, then harm them with beating, desertion and rebuke. But if they repent and correct themselves by offering good deeds, then turn away from harming them. It is understood from this verse and the one before it that if men commit fornication, they are harmed, and women are confined and harmed. The confinement ends in death, and the harm ends in repentance and righteousness. This was in the early days of Islam, then it was abrogated by what Allah and His Messenger legislated, which is stoning for the married man and woman, who are free, adult, and sane, and who have had intercourse in a valid marriage, and one hundred lashes and banishment for a year for others. Indeed, Allah is ever accepting of repentance from His repentant servants, Merciful to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse discusses the punishment for two individuals who commit adultery. It suggests that they should be disciplined. However, if they repent and reform, they should be left alone, as Allah is Accepting of Repentance and Merciful. This also points to the initial rulings which were later changed.</p>

          <p class="arabic">إِنَّمَا التَّوْبَةُ عَلَى اللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السُّوءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ فَأُولَٰئِكَ يَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then repent soon after—Allah will pardon them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil in ignorance and disregard for its consequences and for incurring the displeasure of Allah - every disobedient to Allah, whether by mistake or intentionally, is ignorant in this regard, even if he knows the prohibition - then return to their Lord in repentance and obedience before witnessing death. Those are the ones whose repentance Allah accepts. And Allah is ever Knowing of His creation, Wise in His plan and decree.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah accepts the repentance of those who commit sins out of ignorance or recklessness and then quickly turn to Him in repentance. This highlights Allah's willingness to forgive those who sincerely regret their actions and seek forgiveness.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">However, repentance is not accepted from those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry, “Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And repentance is not accepted of those who persist in committing sins, and do not return to their Lord until death comes to them, then one of them says: "Indeed, I have repented now", just as the repentance of those who die while they are denying, rejecting the oneness of Allah and the message of His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is not accepted. Those who persist in sins until they die, and the deniers who die while they are disbelievers, We have prepared for them a painful punishment.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that repentance is not accepted from those who persist in sin until death approaches, nor from those who die as disbelievers. It underscores the importance of timely repentance before death comes.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery. Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which Allah turns into a great blessing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women forcibly, as part of your inheritance from your fathers, acting upon them by marrying them, preventing them from marriage or marrying them to others while they are unwilling to do so. Nor is it lawful for you to harm your wives while you hate them, so they will give up some of what you have given them of dowry and the like, unless they commit a clear immorality such as adultery. In that case, it is lawful for you to restrain them until you take back what you gave them. And let your companionship with your women be based on honor and love, and fulfilling their rights. If you dislike them for some worldly reason, then be patient; for perhaps you dislike a thing, and Allah has placed within it much good.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse prohibits inheriting women against their will and mistreating them to reclaim dowry unless they commit adultery. It emphasizes fair treatment of women, even if there is dislike towards them, as Allah may place much good in what is disliked.

This is Allah’s commandment to you. ˹But˺ lawful to you are all beyond these—as long as you seek them with your wealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have consummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be mutually gracious regarding the set dowry. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And forbidden to you are married women, except those your right hands possess [through capture in war]. It is lawful for you to marry them after their wombs are cleansed with a menstruation. Allah has decreed this for you, prohibiting marriage with these women and permitting marriage with others, seeking chastity with your wealth, not committing adultery. And for that which you have enjoyed in lawful marriage, give them their due compensation, which Allah has ordained for them. And there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree upon from increase or decrease of the dowry after the obligation has been established. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of His servants’ affairs and Wise in His decrees and governance.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines permissible and forbidden marital relationships. It prohibits marrying already married women, with an exception for female captives. Marriage must be sought with a dowry and with the intention of chastity. Dowries are due to wives, though flexibility in agreements is allowed.

          <p class="quran-text">Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with. And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺. But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Men are the maintainers of women, because Allah has made some of them excel others, and because they spend out of their possessions. So, the righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; then [if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them [lightly]. But if they obey you [once more], seek not means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Men are responsible for the financial support and protection of women. Righteous women are obedient and safeguard their honor and their husband's property in their absence. In cases of marital discord, the verse advises a step-by-step approach: counseling, separation in bed, and then a light disciplinary action, if necessary. However, if the women improve, no further action should be taken. Allah is Exalted and Great, and His guidance should always be followed.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Look at them - O Messenger - marveling at their affair, how they fabricate lies against Allah, and He is exalted above all that is not befitting Him? And this fabrication is sufficient as a great sin revealing the corruption of their belief.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures yet believe in idols and false gods and reassure the disbelievers that they are better guided than the believers?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have you not seen - O Messenger - the affair of those Jews who were given a portion of knowledge? They believe in everything that is worshipped besides Allah, from idols, and devils from among humans and jinn. This belief compels them to seek judgment from other than the law of Allah. And they say to those who disbelieve in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him: 'These disbelievers are more rightly guided, and more just in their path than those who have believed?'</p>
          <p class="explanation">Some who were given scriptures believe in idols and false gods. They even claim that disbelievers are better guided than believers.  This shows their deviation and corruption.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Take your precautions and go forth either in groups or together.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And indeed, among you are those who lag behind from going out to meet the enemies, reluctantly and hindering others intentionally and insistently. If you are destined to be afflicted with killing or defeat, he will say, rejoicing: 'Allah has protected me, as I was not present with those who suffered what I dislike for myself,' and he is pleased with his remaining behind you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Some among the believers will lag behind. If the believers face a hardship, these people rejoice at not being involved, using it as a way to justify their inaction.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who had been told, “Do not fight! Rather, establish prayer and pay alms-tax.”? Then once the order came to fight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as Allah should be feared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And none of you will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Did you not know - O Messenger - the matter of those who were told before permission for fighting was given: Withhold your hands from fighting your enemies, the polytheists, and perform what Allah has prescribed for you of prayer and charity. But when fighting was ordained for them, a group of them changed their behavior and began to fear people as they should fear Allah, or even more. They declared their extreme fear, saying: Our Lord, why have You made fighting obligatory for us? Why not postpone it for us for a near time? This is due to their desire for the enjoyment of worldly life. Say to them - O Messenger -: The enjoyment of the world is small, and the Hereafter and what is in it is greater and more lasting for the one who fears Allah, acting upon what he is commanded and refraining from what he is forbidden. Your Lord does not wrong anyone, even by the amount of the thread that is in the slit of a date seed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses those who were hesitant to fight initially but then became fearful when ordered to do so. It reminds them that the pleasures of this world are fleeting, while the Hereafter is far better for the righteous. Allah does not wrong anyone.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Wherever you may be, death will overcome you—even if you were in fortified towers.” When something good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but when something evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Both have been destined by Allah.” So what is the matter with these people? They can hardly comprehend anything!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Wherever you may be, death will overtake you in any place where you are when your appointed times come, even if you are in fortified castles far from the battlefields. And if they receive something that pleases them from the enjoyment of this life, they attribute its occurrence to Allah, and if something they dislike befalls them, they attribute it to the Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, out of ignorance and pessimism. But they do not know that all of that is from Allah alone, by His decree and predestination. So why do they not even come close to understanding any discourse that is addressed to them?</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse clarifies that death is inevitable and will reach everyone regardless of their location, even if they are in fortified towers. People often attribute good things to Allah, but blame the Prophet for any evil they face, failing to realize that all is from Allah's decree.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَدُّوا لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُوا فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَاءً ۖ فَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَخُذُوهُمْ وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدْتُمُوهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا مِنْهُمْ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The hypocrites wish that you, O believers, would disbelieve in the truth that your hearts have believed, just as they disbelieved in their hearts, so you would be the same as them in disbelief. So do not take them as allies until they emigrate in the way of Allah, as proof of the sincerity of their faith. If they turn away from what they were called to, then seize them wherever you find them and kill them, and do not take from them a protector other than Allah nor a helper to seek help from.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reveals the desire of hypocrites for believers to disbelieve as they do. It instructs believers not to ally with them until they migrate in the cause of Allah. If they refuse, believers are permitted to fight them.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">except those who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those wholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah does not permit you to harm them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Except for those who join a people between whom and you is a treaty, so do not fight them, and likewise those who come to you whose hearts are constrained and dislike fighting you, just as they dislike fighting their people, so they were not with you nor with their people, so do not fight them. And if Allah had willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you with your enemies from among the polytheists, but Allah turned them away from you by His grace and power. If they leave you alone and do not fight you and submit to you, then you have no way to fight them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse makes exceptions for those allied by treaty or those who are unwilling to fight either side. If they offer peace, they should not be harmed, indicating a preference for peace and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">You will find others among the hypocrites who wish to be safe from you, so they show you faith, and they wish to be safe from their disbelieving people, so they show them disbelief. Every time they are returned to the abode of disbelief and the disbelievers, they fall into the worst state. So if these do not depart from you, and offer you complete submission, and refrain from fighting you, then seize them forcefully and kill them wherever they may be. And those who have reached in this bad course a limit that distinguishes them from others, are those whom we have made for you a clear proof for killing and capturing them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse refers to those who are insincere and cannot resist returning to hostility and disbelief. If they do not refrain from fighting, believers are permitted to confront and fight them, highlighting the consequences of persistent hypocrisy and hostility.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">It is not lawful for a believer to kill another except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It is not permissible for a believer to assault his believing brother and kill him unjustly, unless that happens by mistake without intent. Whoever commits that mistake must free a believing slave, and deliver a stipulated compensation to his relatives, unless they give it to him in charity and forgive him. If the slain person was from a disbelieving people who are enemies of the believers, and he is a believer in Allah Almighty, and in what was revealed of the truth to His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then his killer must free a believing slave. If he was from a people with whom you have a covenant and treaty, then his killer must pay compensation to his relatives and free a believing slave. Whoever does not find the ability to free a believing slave, then he must fast for two consecutive months, so that Allah Almighty may accept his repentance. And Allah Almighty is All-Knowing of the true state of His servants, Wise in what He has prescribed for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse outlines the consequences for unintentionally killing a believer. It mandates freeing a believing slave and paying blood-money to the victim's family, unless they charitably waive it. Different circumstances are addressed, such as the victim being from a hostile or treaty-bound group. If a person cannot free a slave, they must fast for two consecutive months as repentance.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And whoever kills a believer intentionally, their reward will be Hell—where they will stay indefinitely. Allah will be displeased with them, condemn them, and will prepare for them a tremendous punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And whoever assaults a believer and kills him intentionally without right, then his penalty is Hell, to abide therein with the wrath of Allah Almighty upon him and his expulsion from His mercy, if He punishes him for his sin, and Allah has prepared for him the most severe punishment because of what he committed of this great crime. But He, glory be to Him, pardons and bestows favor upon the people of faith, so He does not punish them by eternal dwelling in Hell.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse warns against intentionally killing a believer. The punishment is Hell, where the killer will remain indefinitely, incurring Allah's wrath and condemnation. It emphasizes the severity of this crime in Islam.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who you fight. And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain. Instead, Allah has infinite bounties ˹in store˺. You were initially like them then Allah blessed you ˹with Islam˺. So be sure! Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when you go forth in the land striving in the way of Allah, be clear about what you do and what you leave, and do not deny faith to anyone from whom any sign of Islam appears and who does not fight you; due to the possibility that he is a believer concealing his faith, seeking thereby the goods of this worldly life, and Allah Almighty has with Him of bounty and bestowal what enriches you by it. Likewise, you were at the beginning of Islam concealing your faith from your people of the polytheists, then Allah favored you, and empowered you with faith and strength, so be clear and knowledgeable in your matters. Indeed, Allah Almighty is All-Knowing of all your deeds, aware of the details of your matters, and He will recompense you for them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to be cautious and discerning during conflict. It cautions against hastily labeling someone a non-believer just to gain worldly advantages, especially if that person shows signs of peace. It reminds believers that they too were once in a weaker position before Allah blessed them with Islam, and they should therefore be just and thoughtful.</p>

The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on you.

Those who disbelieve in the religion of Allah wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could attack you in a single assault and destroy you.

          <p class="arabic">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۚ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا مُبِينًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give Allah solid proof against yourselves?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not take as allies those who deny the religion of Allah, and abandon the allegiance and love of the believers. Do you want, by loving your enemies, to give Allah a clear proof against you of your lack of sincerity in your faith?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Believers are warned not to take disbelievers as allies instead of fellow believers. Doing so would give Allah clear evidence against them, showing insincerity in their faith.</p>

The same applies to wrongdoings: they may be displayed in order to seek redress from the wrongdoer, or one may forgive and pardon. Forgiveness is better because it is one of Allah's attributes to pardon His servants despite His power over them.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven. They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">The Jews ask you, [O Messenger], for a miracle like the miracle of Moses to attest to your truthfulness: that you bring down upon them a written scripture from Allah, like Moses came with the tablets from Allah. So do not be surprised, [O Messenger], for their predecessors asked Moses - peace be upon him - for something greater: they asked him to show them Allah openly, and they were struck by lightning because of their wrongdoing when they asked for something that was not their right. And after Allah resurrected them after being struck by lightning, and they saw clear signs at the hand of Moses that definitively negate polytheism, they worshipped the calf instead of Allah, but We pardoned their worship of the calf because of their repentance, and We gave Moses a great proof to support the truthfulness of his prophethood.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The People of the Book asked the Prophet for a written revelation from the heavens, similar to what was given to Moses. This verse recounts their past transgressions, including their demand to see Allah and their worship of the calf, and shows how Allah, despite all of that, provided them clear signs and still forgave them.</p>

And Allah spoke to Moses directly; as an honor to him with this attribute. And in this noble verse, there is confirmation of the attribute of speech for Allah - the Exalted - as befits His Majesty, and that He, the Exalted, spoke to His Prophet Moses - peace be upon him - in reality without any intermediary.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Some messengers and their stories are revealed in the Quran, while others are not, based on divine wisdom. Allah spoke directly to Prophet Moses, highlighting his unique status.</p>

But if you persist in your disbelief, then Allah is free of need of you and your faith, because He owns what is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Knowing of your words and deeds, Wise in His legislation and commands. So, if the heavens and the earth have submitted to Allah the Exalted in being and destiny as all of His dominion submits, then it is more fitting for you to believe in Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad, peace be upon him, and in the Quran that was revealed to him, and to submit to that in law, so that the whole universe submits to Allah in destiny and in law.

          <p class="quran-text">O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit ˹created by a command˺ from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for your own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O People of the Gospel, do not exceed the truth in your religion and do not say about Allah except the truth. Do not attribute to Him a wife or a child. Indeed, the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is the messenger of Allah; Allah sent him with the truth, and created him with the Word which He sent to Mary through Gabriel, and it was His saying, "Be," and he was. And it was a breath from Allah Almighty which Gabriel breathed by the command of his Lord, so believe that Allah is one and submit to Him. And believe in His messengers in what they have brought to you from Allah, and act upon it, and do not make Jesus and his mother partners with Allah. Desist from this statement, it is better for you than what you are on. Indeed, Allah is one God, Glory be to Him. What is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, so how could He have a wife or a child from among them? And sufficient is Allah as a trustee over the management of His creation and the direction of their livelihood, so rely on Him alone, for He is sufficient for you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse addresses the People of the Book, urging them not to exaggerate in their religious beliefs about Jesus. It clarifies that Jesus was a messenger of Allah, born through His word and a spirit from Him, emphasizing Allah's Oneness and refuting the concept of the Trinity. Allah is above having a son and is the sole owner of everything.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">They ask you ˹for a ruling, O Prophet˺. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling regarding those who die without children or parents.” If a man dies childless and leaves behind a sister, she will inherit one-half of his estate, whereas her brother will inherit all of her estate if she dies childless. If this person leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the estate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share will be equal to that of two females. Allah makes ˹this˺ clear to you so you do not go astray. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">They ask you -O Messenger- about the ruling on the inheritance of the childless deceased (Kalalah), which is one who dies and has neither children nor parents. Say: Allah clarifies for you the ruling concerning it: If a man dies and has neither children nor parents, and he has a sister by his father and mother, or by his father only, then for her is half of his estate. And his brother inherits all of her wealth if she dies and has neither children nor parents, whether he is a full brother or a brother by the father. And if there are two sisters of the childless deceased, then for them is two-thirds of what he leaves. And if brothers (not from the same mother) gather with sisters, then for the male is the equivalent of the share of two females among his sisters. Allah clarifies for you the division of inheritances and the ruling of the childless deceased, lest you go astray from the truth in the matter of inheritance. And Allah is Knowing of the consequences of matters, and what they contain of good for His servants.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse provides rulings on inheritance for those who die without children or parents (known as *Kalalah*). It specifies shares for sisters and brothers, ensuring a just distribution of the deceased's estate. A sister gets half, and the brother gets all if she dies childless and the distribution between male and female siblings are clarified. Allah explains these laws so that people don't make mistakes in inheritance matters.</p>
