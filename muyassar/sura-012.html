They said: O our father, what more could we ask for than this? This is our purchase price, the Aziz has returned it to us, so be reassured about our brother, and send him with us; so we can bring plenty of food for our family, and protect our brother, and increase a camel-load for him; for the Aziz measures for each one a camel-load, and that is an easy measure for him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The brothers discover their money has been returned. They see this as a sign of favor, using it as a strong argument to persuade their father to send Benjamin with them, promising to bring more food and ensure his safety.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Jacob said to them: I will not let him go with you until you pledge and swear to me by Allah that you will return him to me, unless you are overcome and cannot rescue him. So when they gave him the pledge of Allah on what he requested, Jacob said: Allah is a witness over what we say, meaning His testimony and protection is sufficient for us.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Jacob requires a solemn oath from his sons to ensure Benjamin's safe return, except in cases of unavoidable circumstance. After they pledge, Jacob states that *Allah is a Witness to what we have said*, signifying Allah's awareness and role as a guarantor.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">He then instructed ˹them˺, “O my sons! Do not enter ˹the city˺ all through one gate, but through separate gates. I cannot help you against ˹what is destined by˺ Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And their father said to them: O my sons, when you enter the land of Egypt, do not enter through one gate, but enter through separate gates, so that you are not afflicted by the evil eye. And indeed, by advising you with this, I cannot avert anything that Allah has decreed for you. The judgment is only for Allah alone; upon Him I have relied and trusted, and upon Him alone the believers rely.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Jacob advises his sons to enter the city through separate gates, a precaution against the evil eye, while emphasizing that only *Allah decides*. He stresses that his trust is in *Allah alone*, and so should the faithful.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Then when they entered as their father had instructed them, this did not help them against ˹the Will of˺ Allah whatsoever. It was just a desire in Jacob’s heart which he satisfied. He was truly blessed with ˹great˺ knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people have no knowledge.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And when they entered through separate gates as their father had commanded them, that did not avert the decree of Allah from them, but it was out of compassion in Jacob's soul for them, lest they be afflicted by the evil eye. And indeed Jacob was a possessor of great knowledge regarding his religion, which Allah had taught him through revelation, but most people do not know the consequences of things and the subtleties of matters, and what Jacob - peace be upon him - knows of his religion.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The brothers followed their father's instruction but it ultimately doesn't alter Allah's decree. Jacob's precautionary measure was a natural desire. The verse also highlights his divine knowledge, which most people lack.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">They returned with Joseph's brothers to him, and he himself began searching their bags, beginning with their bags before his brother’s bag, to ensure what he had planned to keep his brother with him, then he ended with his brother's container and brought out the cup from it. Thus We facilitated for Joseph this plan, by which he succeeded in taking his brother, and it was not possible for him to take his brother in the law of the king of Egypt, because it was not in his religion to enslave the thief, except that the will of Allah required this plan and resort to the law of Joseph's brothers that rules that the thief should be enslaved. We raise in rank whom We will in this world above others, just as We raised the rank of Joseph. And above every possessor of knowledge, there is one who is more knowledgeable than him, until the knowledge ends with Allah, the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Joseph began searching the bags, starting with the other brothers' before Benjamin's, then the cup was found in Benjamin's bag.

          <p class="muyassar">Joseph’s brothers said, “If he has stolen, then a brother of his had stolen before.” (They were referring to Joseph, peace be upon him).

          <p class="arabic">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَىٰ ۗ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۗ وَلَدَارُ الْآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا ۗ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">We only sent before you ˹O Prophet˺ men inspired by Us from among the people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? And surely the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We sent not before you, [O Messenger], to the people except men from among them to whom We revealed, and they were from among the people of settlements, so they are more capable of understanding the call and the message, the guided ones of the truth believe them, and those astray from it deny them. So have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of the previous deniers, and what befell them of destruction? And the reward of the Hereafter is better than the world and what is in it for those who believe and fear their Lord. Then will you not ponder and take heed?</p>
          <p class="explanation">Messengers before the Prophet were also men from their societies. The consequences for past deniers should be a lesson. The Hereafter is far better for the mindful.</p>

          <h2>Verse 110</h2>
          <p class="arabic">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُوا جَاءَهُمْ نَصْرُنَا فَنُجِّيَ مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُنَا عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them ˹at last˺. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not be impatient, [O Messenger], for victory over those who deny you, for the Messengers before you did not receive victory quickly, for a wisdom We know, until when the Messengers despaired of their people, and were certain that their people had denied them and there was no hope in their faith, Our victory came to them at the height of distress, and We save whom We will of the Messengers and their followers, and Our punishment is not averted from those who commit crimes and dare to disobey Allah. And in this is a consolation for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When messengers despaired, Allah's help came to them. Allah's punishment cannot be avoided by the wicked. This serves as consolation for the Prophet.</p>

          <h2>Verse 111</h2>
          <p class="arabic">لَقَدْ كَانَ فِي قَصَصِهِمْ عِبْرَةٌ لِأُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ ۗ مَا كَانَ حَدِيثًا يُفْتَرَىٰ وَلَٰكِنْ تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather ˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">There was certainly in the stories of the messengers which We have related to you and what befell the deniers a lesson for those of sound intellect. This Quran was not a fabricated narrative, but a confirmation of what was before it of the heavenly books, and a clarification of all that the servants need of lawful and unlawful, loved and disliked, and other than that, and guidance from misguidance, and a mercy for the people of faith by which their hearts are guided, so they act upon what is in it of commands and prohibitions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The stories in the Quran provide lessons for thoughtful people. It confirms previous scriptures, clarifies important matters, and is guidance and mercy for believers.</p>
