          <h2>Verse 1</h2>
          <p class="arabic">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Glory be to the One Who took His servant ˹Muḥammad˺ by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Allah glorifies Himself and magnifies His status, due to His ability to do what no one else is capable of. There is no god but Him, and no lord besides Him. He is the One Who took His servant Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, on a journey by night with his body and soul, while awake, not in a dream, from the Sacred Mosque in "Mecca" to the Farthest Mosque in "Jerusalem", which Allah has blessed its surroundings with crops, fruits and other things, and made it a place for many prophets, to see the wonders of Allah's power and evidence of His oneness. Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, is the Hearer of all sounds, the Seer of everything seen. He gives each what he deserves in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse refers to the miraculous Night Journey of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Farthest Mosque in Jerusalem. It highlights Allah's power and shows that He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guide for the Children of Israel, ˹stating:˺ “Do not take besides Me any other Trustee of Affairs,</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And just as Allah honored Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, with the Night Journey, He honored Moses, peace be upon him, by giving him the Torah, and made it a clear statement of the truth and guidance for the Children of Israel, including their prohibition from taking anyone other than Allah as a guardian or god to whom they entrust their affairs.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Similar to the honor given to Prophet Muhammad, Prophet Moses was given the Scripture (Torah) as a guide for the Children of Israel. It emphasizes that they should not take any guardian or god other than Allah.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">O descendants of those whom We saved and carried with Noah in the Ark, do not associate anything with Allah in His worship, and be grateful for His blessings, following the example of Noah, peace be upon him; indeed, he was a grateful servant to Allah with his heart, tongue, and limbs.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse reminds the descendants of those who were saved with Prophet Noah to be grateful to Allah and to worship Him alone, just like Noah who was a very thankful servant.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will certainly cause corruption in the land twice, and you will become extremely arrogant.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And We informed the Children of Israel in the Torah that was revealed to them that they must commit corruption twice in "Jerusalem" and its vicinity by injustice, killing prophets, arrogance, tyranny, and aggression.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Children of Israel were warned that they would commit great acts of corruption in Jerusalem twice and act with extreme arrogance.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">“When the first of the two warnings would come to pass, We would send against you some of Our servants of great might, who would ravage your homes. This would be a warning fulfilled.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So when they commit the first corruption, We will send against them servants of Ours, of great courage and intense power, who will overcome them, kill them, and scatter them, so they will roam through their homes as corrupters, and that was a promise that must come to pass, due to the existence of its cause from them.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Then We restored to you - O Children of Israel - the victory and dominance over your enemies who were sent against you, and We increased your provisions and your children, and We strengthened you and made you more numerous than your enemy; and that was because of your good deeds and submission to Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">After their repentance, Allah gave the Children of Israel victory over their enemies and increased their wealth and numbers as a result of their good deeds and submission to Allah.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">If you act rightly, it is for your own good, but if you do wrong, it is to your own loss. And when the second warning would come to pass, your enemies would ˹be left to˺ totally disgrace you and enter the Temple ˹of Jerusalem˺ as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If you do good in your deeds and words, then you have done good for yourselves, because the reward for that will return to you, and if you do evil, then the punishment for that will return upon you, so when the time for the second corruption comes, We will send against you your enemies again, to humiliate and defeat you, and the signs of disgrace and humiliation will appear on your faces, and so they enter "Jerusalem" and destroy it, as they destroyed it the first time, and to destroy everything that falls under their hands with complete destruction.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse states that good actions benefit the doer while evil harms them. When the second act of corruption occurred, Allah sent enemies to humiliate them, enter the Temple in Jerusalem, and utterly destroy everything.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you ˹if you repent˺, but if you return ˹to sin˺, We will return ˹to punishment˺. And We have made Hell a ˹permanent˺ confinement for the disbelievers.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">It may be that your Lord - O Children of Israel - will have mercy on you after His retribution if you repent and reform. And if you return to corruption and injustice, We will return to your punishment and humiliation. And We have made Hell a prison for you and for the disbelievers in general, from which there is no escape forever. And in this verse and what preceded it, there is a warning to this nation against committing sins, lest it suffer the same fate as the Children of Israel, for the laws of Allah are one and do not change or alter.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse suggests that Allah may show mercy to those who repent, but if they return to sin, punishment will follow. Hell is described as a permanent confinement for disbelievers, emphasizing the consequence of rejecting faith.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">And man sometimes calls down evil upon himself or his child or his wealth, and that is when angry, just as he calls down good, and this is from man's ignorance and haste.

          <p class="arabic">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الضُّرُّ فِي الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَنْ تَدْعُونَ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ ۖ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاكُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ الْإِنْسَانُ كَفُورًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">When you are touched with hardship at sea, you ˹totally˺ forget all ˹the gods˺ you ˹normally˺ invoke, except Him. But when He delivers you ˹safely˺ to shore, you turn away. Humankind is ever ungrateful.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And if a hardship befalls you at sea, until you are on the verge of drowning and destruction, those you worship of idols vanish from your minds, and you remember Allah, the Almighty, alone; to rescue and save you, so you become sincere to Him in seeking help and relief. Then He rescues and saves you, but when He has brought you safely to land, you turn away from faith, sincerity, and righteous deeds. This is from the ignorance and disbelief of man. And man is ungrateful for the favors of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes how people turn to Allah in times of extreme hardship at sea, forgetting their idols, but then revert to their old ways of disbelief once they are safe. It highlights human ingratitude.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or unleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Have you - O people - become heedless of the punishment of Allah, so you feel secure that the earth might swallow you up, or that Allah might send down upon you stones from the sky and kill you, then you will find no one to protect you from His punishment?</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse questions people's sense of security and warns them of Allah's power to cause the earth to swallow them or send a destructive storm. It serves as a reminder that no one can protect them from Allah's punishment.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again, and send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then you will find none to avenge you against Us.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Or have you - O people - become secure from your Lord, while you have disbelieved in Him, that He might return you to the sea again, and send upon you a fierce wind, which shatters everything it comes upon, so He drowns you because of your disbelief, then you will find no claim or demand for us? Indeed Allah did not wrong you by an atom’s weight.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Continuing the previous warning, this verse reminds people that Allah could return them to the sea and destroy them for their disbelief, highlighting the lack of any power to challenge Allah's will.</p>
