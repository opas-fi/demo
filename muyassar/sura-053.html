They are only names that you and your forefathers have named in accordance with your false desires. Allah has not sent down any proof with them that would justify your claims about them. These polytheists follow nothing but conjecture and the desires of their own souls, which are deviated from sound nature.

          <p class="quran-text">and ˹then˺ Thamûd, sparing no one.</p>

These were more rebellious and more disbelieving than those who came after them. And the cities of the people of Lot, Allah turned them upside down, and made their high part their low part, and covered them with what He covered them of stones.</p>
