          <p class="muyassar">(Nun) The discussion about the disjointed letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah. Allah swears by the pen with which the angels and people write, and by what they write of good, benefit, and knowledge. You are not, [O Messenger], by the grace of Allah upon you of prophethood and the message, of weak intellect, nor of foolish opinion, and you have, for what you endure of hardships in conveying the message, a great reward that will not be diminished nor cut off, and you, [O Messenger], are of great character, which is what the Quran contained of noble ethics; for the implementation of the Quran was his nature, he followed its commands and refrained from what it forbade.</p>

The most just of them said: "Did I not tell you, why do you not make an exception and say: if Allah wills?" After they returned to their senses, they said: "Allah, our Lord, is free from injustice in what has befallen us, but we were the wrongdoers to ourselves by abandoning the exception and our evil intention." Then they turned to one another, each blaming the other for abandoning the exception and for their evil intention. They said: "Woe to us, indeed, we were transgressors in our prevention of the poor and violating the command of Allah. Perhaps our Lord will give us better than our garden because of our repentance and our confession of our sin. Indeed, we are to our Lord alone desirous, hoping for forgiveness, seeking good." Such a punishment that we punished the people of the garden will be our punishment in this world for everyone who disobeys the command of Allah and is stingy with what Allah has given him of blessings and does not fulfill the right of Allah in them. And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater and more severe than the punishment of the world, if only they knew, they would refrain from every cause that necessitates punishment.</p>
