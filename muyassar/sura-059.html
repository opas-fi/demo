          <p class="quran-text">He is the One Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book from their homes for ˹their˺ first banishment ˹ever˺. You never thought they would go. And they thought their strongholds would put them out of Allah’s reach. But ˹the decree of˺ Allah came upon them from where they never expected. And He cast horror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson ˹from this˺, O people of insight!</p>
          <p class="muyassar">He - Glory be to Him - is the One who expelled those who denied the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the People of the Book, who were the Jews of Banu Nadir, from their dwellings that were near the Muslims around "Medina." That was the first expulsion of them from "the Arabian Peninsula" to "the Levant." You did not think, O Muslims, that they would be expelled from their homes in such humiliation and disgrace because of their strength and power, and the Jews thought that their fortresses would repel the wrath of Allah and that no one could overcome them. But Allah came to them from where they had not expected, and He cast fear and great panic into their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed, O people of sound insight and sound minds, from what happened to them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah expelled the disbelieving People of the Book from their homes. They felt secure in their strongholds, but Allah's decree came unexpectedly, casting fear into their hearts, and they destroyed their homes. This serves as a lesson for those with insight.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">As for gains granted by Allah to His Messenger from the people of ˹other˺ lands, they are for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers so that wealth may not merely circulate among your rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatever he forbids you from, leave it. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">What Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from the wealth of the polytheists of the people of the villages without riding horses or camels, is for Allah and His Messenger, to be spent in the public interests of the Muslims, and for the relatives of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the orphans, who are the poor children whose fathers have died, and the needy, who are those in need and poverty, and the wayfarer, who is the traveling stranger whose expenses have run out and whose wealth has been cut off; that is so that the money will not be circulating solely amongst the rich, and the poor and needy will be deprived of it. And whatever the Messenger gives you of wealth, or legislates for you of the law, then take it, and whatever he forbids you from taking or doing, then abstain from it, and fear Allah by complying with His commands and abandoning His prohibitions. Indeed, Allah is severe in punishment for those who disobey Him and oppose His command and prohibition. And this verse is a principle in the necessity of acting upon the Sunnah: in words, deeds, or approval.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The gains from other lands are for Allah, His Messenger, his relatives, orphans, the poor, and travelers. This distribution ensures wealth doesn't remain solely with the rich. It also emphasizes the importance of following the Messenger's teachings.</p>

          <p class="explanation">A portion of the gains is for the poor emigrants who left their homes for Allah's sake. These are the true believers, seeking Allah's bounty and supporting His religion.</p>

          <h2>Verse 19</h2>
          <p class="arabic">وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ نَسُوا اللَّهَ فَأَنْسَاهُمْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. It is they who are ˹truly˺ rebellious.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And do not be, O believers, like those who abandoned the fulfillment of Allah’s right which He made obligatory upon them, so He caused them, because of that, to forget their own portions of the good deeds that would save them from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection. Those are the ones described as the defiantly disobedient, those who have gone out from the obedience to Allah and His Messenger.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Do not be like those who forget Allah, leading them to forget their own souls and the good deeds they should be doing. They are the rebellious ones who disobey Allah and His Messenger.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Not equal are the companions of the Fire, who are punished, and the companions of Paradise, who are blessed. The companions of Paradise are the ones who have attained all that they have sought, and are saved from all that is disliked.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The people of Hellfire and the people of Paradise are not alike. Only the people of Paradise will be successful in attaining their ultimate desires.</p>

          <p class="arabic">لَوْ أَنْزَلْنَا هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعًا مُتَصَدِّعًا مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Had We sent down this Quran upon a mountain, you would have certainly seen it humbled and torn apart in awe of Allah. We set forth such comparisons for people, ˹so˺ perhaps they may reflect.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">If We had sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, and it understood what is in it of promise and warning, you would have seen it, despite its strength, firmness, and size, humbling itself, and splitting asunder from fear of Allah Almighty. And those examples We strike and make clear for the people that perhaps they may reflect on the power of Allah and His Greatness. And in the verse is an urging to ponder the Qur'an, understand its meanings and act upon it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the Quran was revealed to a mountain, it would crumble out of awe for Allah. This is a reminder for people to reflect on the Quran and its meanings.</p>
