That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So when they did that, Allah cast upon them sleep and protected them. And you see - O observer of them - the sun when it rises from the east, it inclines away from their place towards the right, and when it sets, it leaves them towards the left, and they are in a spacious area of the cave, so the heat of the sun does not harm them, and the air does not cease from them. That which We did for these youths is from the signs of the power of Allah. He whom Allah guides to be guided by His verses, he is the one who is guided to the truth, and he who is not guided to that, then you will not find a helper for him to guide him to attaining the truth, because guidance and abandonment are in the hands of Allah alone.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse describes a miracle: the sun avoids the cave where the believers rested, indicating Allah's protection. Guidance comes from Allah, and those who stray will find no guide.</p>

So some of them said: We stayed a day or part of a day, and others, the matter was confusing to them: Entrust the knowledge of that to Allah, your Lord is most knowing of the time that you stayed, so send one of you with this silver money of yours to our city so let him see: which of the people of the city is most lawful and purer in food? So let him bring you provision from it, and let him be gentle in his purchase with the seller so that we do not become exposed, and our matter becomes apparent, and let no one from the people know about you.</p>
          <p class="explanation">After being asleep for a long period, the believers awakened and began to question each other. They decided to send one of them to the city with silver coins to find pure food while being very cautious.</p>

When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺, some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And just as We caused them to sleep for many years, and then We awakened them, We made the people of that time aware of them, after the seller revealed the type of dirhams their messenger had brought; so that people would know that Allah's promise of resurrection is true, and that the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it, when those who learned about the people of the cave disputed about the matter of resurrection: some affirmed it and some denied it. So Allah made their discovery by the people a proof for the believers against the disbelievers. After their affair was revealed and they died, a group of those who knew about them said: Build a building at the entrance of the cave to conceal them, and leave them to their own affair, their Lord knows best about their condition. And those with influence and power among them said: We will surely take their place of rest as a mosque for worship. And the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, forbade taking the graves of prophets and righteous people as mosques, and cursed those who did that in his last instructions to his nation, just as he forbade building on graves in general, and plastering and writing on them, because that is excessive veneration that may lead to worship of those in them.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah revealed the sleepers of the cave to show people the truth of resurrection. After their discovery, people debated what to do; some suggested building a memorial, while others wanted to build a place of worship, although building on graves is not permitted in Islam.</p>

          <p class="arabic">سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَاثَةٌ رَابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ ۖ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ ۚ قُلْ رَبِّي أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِمْ مَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ ۗ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلَّا مِرَاءً ظَاهِرًا وَلَا تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِمْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَدًا</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge, nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Some of the People of the Book who delve into their matter will say: They were three, the fourth of them being their dog. And another group will say: They were five, the sixth of them being their dog, and the words of both groups are based on conjecture without evidence. And a third group says: They were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say - O Messenger -: My Lord is most knowing of their number, none knows their number except a few of His creation. So do not argue with the People of the Book about their number except with a clear argument that is not deep, by only relating to them what the revelation has informed you of, and do not ask them about their number and their circumstances, for they do not know that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">People have differing opinions about the number of the sleepers in the cave, with some guessing. Allah emphasizes that only He knows the exact number, and we should not argue about it without knowledge. Instead, focus on the lessons of the story.</p>
