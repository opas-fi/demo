As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">He is the One who has sent down the Quran to you: from it are verses of clear meaning, they are the foundation of the Book to which one resorts when confused, and to which what contradicts it is referred. And from it are other verses that are ambiguous and can have several meanings, their intended meaning only becoming clear by combining them with the clear verses. So those whose hearts are diseased and deviant, because of their evil intentions, follow these ambiguous verses alone, to create doubts among the people, so that they mislead them, and to interpret them according to their false doctrines. And no one knows the true meanings of these verses except Allah. And those well-grounded in knowledge say: 'We believe in this Quran, all of it has come to us from our Lord through the tongue of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace', and they refer the ambiguous to the clear. And only those of sound intellect understand, comprehend, and ponder the meanings correctly.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Quran has clear verses that form its foundation, and others that are open to interpretation. Those with doubts try to misinterpret these, but only Allah knows their true meaning. Those with knowledge believe it all comes from Allah.</p>

And Allah made that a reason for the Muslims' victory over them. And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills of His servants. Indeed, in this event is a great lesson for the people of insight who are guided to the judgment and deeds of Allah.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Battle of Badr serves as a sign, where believers, though outnumbered, were supported by Allah to victory. This is a lesson for those with insight into Allah's power.</p>

And the disagreement between the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians, did not occur, and they did not divide into sects and parties, except after the proof was established against them through the sending of messengers and the revelation of books; out of envy and jealousy seeking the worldly life.

And say to them, and to the polytheists of the Arabs and others: if you submit, then you are on the straight path and the guidance and the truth, and if you turn away, then your reckoning is with Allah, and it is only incumbent upon me to convey, and I have conveyed to you and established the proof against you. And Allah is All-Seeing of His servants, nothing of their affairs is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The Prophet is instructed to declare his submission to Allah and invite others to do the same. Guidance comes from submission to Allah, while the Prophet's duty is to deliver the message. Allah is aware of all His servants.</p>

          <p class="arabic">فَمَنْ حَاجَّكَ فِيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَنِسَاءَنَا وَنِسَاءَكُمْ وَأَنْفُسَنَا وَأَنْفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَلْ لَعْنَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَاذِبِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">Now, whoever disputes with you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning Jesus after full knowledge has come to you, say, “Come! Let us gather our children and your children, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves—then let us sincerely invoke Allah’s curse upon the liars.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">So whoever disputes with you - O Messenger - concerning the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, after the knowledge has come to you in the matter of Jesus, peace be upon him, then say to them: Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then let us turn to Allah in supplication, asking Him to send down His punishment and curse on the liars in their statements, who are insistent on their stubbornness.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs the Prophet to propose a Mubahala (a sincere invocation calling for God's curse) against those who dispute the truth about Jesus after knowledge has come to them, to show that they are liars.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Say, [O Messenger], to the People of the Scripture, the Jews and Christians: "Come to a word of justice and truth that we all adhere to: that we single out Allah alone for worship, not taking any partner with Him, whether idol, statue, cross, tyrant, or anything else, nor should some of us be subservient to others besides Allah. If they turn away from this good call, then say to them, O believers, 'Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to our Lord in servitude and sincerity.'

          <p class="explanation">This verse calls on the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) to unite on the common principle of worshipping Allah alone and not associating any partners with Him. Muslims are to bear witness to their submission to Allah.</p>

          <p class="arabic">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ النَّبِيِّينَ لَمَا آتَيْتُكُمْ مِنْ كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنْصُرُنَّهُ ۚ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِي ۖ قَالُوا أَقْرَرْنَا ۚ قَالَ فَاشْهَدُوا وَأَنَا مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الشَّاهِدِينَ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹Remember˺ when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺ “Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And [mention, O Messenger], when Allah took the covenant of the prophets, [saying], “Whatever I give you of the Scripture and wisdom, and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, you must believe in him and support him.” Allah said, “Have you acknowledged and taken My covenant?” They said, “We have acknowledged it.” He said, “Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.” And in this is that Allah took a covenant from every prophet to believe in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and took a covenant from the nations of the prophets regarding that.</p>
          <p class="explanation">God made a covenant with all the prophets, obligating them to believe in and support any future messenger confirming their scriptures. This verse establishes the continuity of divine guidance and the importance of acknowledging new revelations.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Do these wicked people of the People of the Book desire other than the religion of Allah – and it is Islam which Allah sent with Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace – while everyone in the heavens and the earth has submitted and surrendered and humbled themselves to Allah willingly, like the believers, and unwillingly during hardships, when it does not benefit them, and they are the disbelievers. As the rest of creation has submitted to Him, and to Him they will be returned on the Day of Judgment so He may reward each one according to his deeds. This is a warning from Allah Almighty to His creation that none of them may return to Him upon any creed other than Islam.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Why would anyone seek a religion other than Islam, when all beings in the heavens and earth submit to God's will, either willingly or by compulsion? All will ultimately return to Him.</p>

          <p class="muyassar">Say to them - O Messenger -: We have believed in Allah and obeyed, so there is no lord for us other than Him, and no one worthy of worship except Him, and we have believed in the revelation that Allah sent down to us, and that which He sent down to Ibrahim, the friend of Allah, and his two sons, Ismail and Isaac, and the son of his son, Jacob son of Isaac, and that which He sent down to the tribes - and they are the prophets who were in the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel from the descendants of Jacob - and what was given to Moses and Jesus of the Torah and the Gospel, and what Allah sent down to His prophets. We believe in all of that and do not differentiate between any of them, and to Allah alone we are submissive in obedience, acknowledging His Lordship, divinity and worship.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse instructs believers to affirm their faith in Allah, the Quran, and all previous prophets and scriptures, without making any distinction between them. They are to submit to Allah alone.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">And hold firmly to the rope of Allah and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">And hold fast, all of you, to the Book of your Lord and the guidance of your Prophet, and do not do what leads to your division. And remember a great blessing Allah bestowed upon you: when you - O believers - before Islam, were enemies, Allah united your hearts in love for Him and love for His Messenger, and He cast into your hearts love for one another, and you became - by His grace - loving brothers. And you were on the brink of the Fire of Hell, and Allah guided you through Islam and saved you from the Fire. And just as Allah has made clear to you the hallmarks of correct faith, so He makes clear to you everything that is for your benefit, so that you may be guided to the path of righteousness, follow it, and not stray from it.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse calls for unity and adherence to Allah's teachings, remembering the favor of unity after previous discord. It highlights how Islam saved believers from the brink of destruction.</p>

As for those who remain steadfast in faith and thank their Lord for the blessing of Islam, then Allah will reward them the best of rewards.</p>
          <p class="explanation">This verse states that Muhammad is a messenger like others before him. His death should not cause believers to revert to disbelief. Those who remain grateful will be rewarded by Allah.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.</p>
          <p class="muyassar">Then, it was from the mercy of Allah to the sincere believers that He cast into their hearts, after the distress and sorrow that had befallen them, reassurance and trust in Allah's promise. And one of its effects was a drowsiness that overcame a group of them, who were people of sincerity and certainty. Another group were preoccupied with the salvation of their own souls in particular, their determination weakened, they became preoccupied with themselves, and they thought ill of their Lord, His religion, and His Prophet. They thought that Allah would not complete the matter of His Messenger, and that Islam would not stand. Therefore, you see them regretting their departure. Some of them say to others: 'Did we have any choice in going out to fight?' Say to them - O Messenger -: 'Indeed, the matter is all with Allah. He is the One who decreed your departure and what happened to you.' And they conceal in themselves what they do not reveal to you of regret for going out to fight. They say: 'If we had the slightest choice, we would not have been killed here.' Say to them: 'Indeed, the terms of life are in the hand of Allah. And even if you were in your homes, and Allah had decreed that you would die, those whom Allah had decreed to die would have gone out to where they would be killed.' And Allah did not make that except to test what is in your hearts of doubt and hypocrisy, and to distinguish the bad from the good, and to reveal the affair of the believer from the hypocrite to the people in words and deeds. And Allah is Knowing of what is in the hearts of His creation. Nothing of their affairs is hidden from Him.</p>
          <p class="explanation">After distress, Allah granted peace to some believers through drowsiness, while others had doubts, thinking Allah wouldn't support His Messenger. They questioned their role in battle, not knowing that all matters are predetermined by Allah. They concealed regrets about their participation, thinking that if they had stayed home, they wouldn't have died. Allah tests what’s in the hearts.</p>

He asks us to lend Him money.” We will record what they have said and that they approve of the killing of their fathers who were the prophets of Allah unjustly and aggressively, and we will hold them accountable for that in the Hereafter, and say to them while they are in the Fire being punished, “Taste the punishment of the burning Fire.”</p>

          <p class="muyassar">That severe punishment is because of what you have put forth in your worldly life of verbal, physical, and belief-related sins, and that Allah is not unjust to the servants.</p>

          <p class="quran-text">Those ˹are the same people˺ who say, “Allah has commanded us not to believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire ˹from the sky˺.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Other prophets did in fact come to you before me with clear proofs and ˹even˺ what you demanded—why then did you kill them, if what you say is true?”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">These Jews, when they were called to Islam, said, “Indeed, Allah has enjoined upon us in the Torah not to believe anyone who comes to us saying: ‘He is a messenger from Allah,’ until he comes to us with a sacrifice by which he seeks nearness to Allah, and a fire descends from the sky and burns it.” Say to them - O Messenger - “You are liars in your saying, because there came to your fathers messengers from Me with miracles and evidence of their truthfulness, and with what you said about bringing a sacrifice that the fire consumes, so why did your fathers kill these prophets if you are truthful in your claims?”</p>
          <p class="explanation">The verse highlights the hypocritical demand of the Jews for a miraculous sign (fire consuming a sacrifice) before they would believe in a messenger. It reminds them that their ancestors also rejected prophets who came with clear signs, even killing some of them.</p>

          <p class="explanation">Believers will be tested through their wealth, their lives, and by hearing hurtful words from those who oppose them.
