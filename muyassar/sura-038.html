          <h2>Verse 26</h2>
          <p class="arabic">يَا دَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاكَ خَلِيفَةً فِي الْأَرْضِ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا تَتَّبِعِ الْهَوَىٰ فَيُضِلَّكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَضِلُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا نَسُوا يَوْمَ الْحِسَابِ</p>
          <p class="quran-text">˹We instructed him:˺ “O David! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between people with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you astray from Allah’s Way. Surely those who go astray from Allah’s Way will suffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.”</p>
          <p class="muyassar">O David, indeed We have made you a successor on earth and given you dominion therein, so judge between the people with justice and fairness, and do not follow desire in judgments, lest it leads you astray from the religion of Allah and His law. Indeed, those who stray from the path of Allah will have a painful punishment in the Fire, for their negligence of the Day of Recompense and Account. And in this is a recommendation for the rulers to judge by the truth revealed from Allah, blessed and exalted be He, and not deviate from it, lest they stray from His path.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Allah instructs Prophet David to rule justly and not to follow personal desires, as those who stray from Allah's path face severe punishment.</p>
