    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"A. L. M.","commentary":"This verse begins with three Arabic letters: <strong>Alif, Lam, Mim</strong>. These letters are presented at the start of this chapter (sura) of the Quran to draw the attention of the audience to the very building blocks of the Arabic language itself. The Quran, despite being composed of these familiar letters, is presented as a unique and inimitable text. This is similar to a challenge posed in a previous chapter, asking people to produce even a single chapter comparable to it if they doubted its divine origin. In this chapter, this reference to the letters serves to highlight that this book comes from <strong>Allah</strong>, the one and only divine being, yet it is in the same language as the people it addresses, including those of earlier faiths.","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal.","commentary":"This verse establishes the <strong>absolute oneness of Allah</strong>. It declares that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. Allah is described as <strong>\"the Ever-living,\"</strong> possessing true and unrestricted life, and <strong>\"the Eternal Master of all,\"</strong> the one who gives and sustains all existence. This fundamental principle distinguishes the Islamic faith from all other beliefs and ideologies, including those that involve multiple gods or ascribe divine attributes to created beings. This verse follows the introduction in Verse 1 by immediately stating the core message of the divine book: the uniqueness of Allah as the sole source of existence and authority.","arabic":"اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ"},{"verse":"3","text":"It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).","commentary":"This verse states that <strong>Allah</strong> has revealed the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad with the truth. It also clarifies that <strong>Allah</strong> had previously revealed the Torah to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus. The Quran is presented as <strong>confirming the truths</strong> found in these earlier scriptures. This verse builds upon the declaration of Allah's oneness in Verse 2 by showing that this same <strong>Allah</strong> is the source of guidance throughout history, providing continuity between different divine messages.","arabic":"نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَأَنْزَلَ التَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنْجِيلَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution.","commentary":"Continuing from Verse 3, this verse explains that the Torah and the Gospel were revealed as <strong>guidance for people</strong>. It further states that <strong>Allah</strong> has revealed the Quran as <strong>\"the Criterion,\"</strong> a means to distinguish what is true from what is false. The verse then warns that those who reject <strong>Allah's</strong> revelations will face severe suffering, emphasizing <strong>Allah's</strong> power and ability to deliver justice. This verse connects to the previous one by highlighting the purpose of divine revelation and the consequences of disbelief in it.","arabic":"مِنْ قَبْلُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَأَنْزَلَ الْفُرْقَانَ ۗ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ"},{"verse":"5","text":"From Allah, verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens.","commentary":"This verse asserts the <strong>absolute knowledge of Allah</strong>. It emphasizes that nothing, whether on Earth or in the heavens, is concealed from Him. This statement reinforces the attributes of <strong>Allah</strong> mentioned in Verse 2 (the Eternal Master) and Verse 4 (the Mighty, able to requite) by highlighting His complete awareness of all things. This provides a context for the warning given in the previous verse, as <strong>Allah</strong> is fully aware of those who disbelieve.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ"},{"verse":"6","text":"He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","commentary":"This verse speaks of <strong>Allah's</strong> <strong>creative power</strong>. It states that He is the one who forms individuals in the wombs according to His will. The verse reiterates that there is no deity except Him, and describes Him as <strong>\"the Almighty,\"</strong> possessing the power to shape and fashion creation, and <strong>\"the Wise,\"</strong> who determines everything according to His perfect wisdom. This verse connects to the previous one by giving a personal example of <strong>Allah's</strong> knowledge and power, demonstrating His intimate involvement in the creation of human beings. It also serves to counter any claims of divine partnership by affirming <strong>Allah's</strong> sole authority and wisdom in creation.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الْأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"7","text":"He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:\" and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.","commentary":"This verse explains that the Quran contains two types of verses: <strong>clear and precise verses</strong>, which form the foundation of the Book, and <strong>allegorical verses</strong>, which may have more than one interpretation. The verse notes that those who deviate from the truth tend to focus on the allegorical verses to create division and misinterpret them. It emphasizes that only <strong>Allah</strong> knows the ultimate meaning of these allegorical verses. In contrast, those who are firmly grounded in knowledge believe in all the verses, both clear and allegorical, recognizing that they all come from <strong>Allah</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that only those with true understanding and insight will take heed of this guidance. This verse builds upon the previous ones by explaining the nature of the revealed text itself and how different people approach it. It cautions against misinterpreting scripture and highlights the importance of recognizing <strong>Allah</strong> as the ultimate source of understanding.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ ۖ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَاءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَاءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ ۗ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ۗ وَالرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِنْ عِنْدِ رَبِّنَا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّا أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"8","text":"\"Our Lord!\" (they say), \"Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>prayer of those who are firmly grounded in knowledge</strong> and have taken heed of the guidance in the Quran. They pray to <strong>Allah</strong> to keep their hearts steadfast on the truth after He has guided them. They also ask for His mercy, acknowledging Him as the ultimate source of all good. This prayer reflects the attitude of true believers who, having understood the nature of the Quran as explained in Verse 7, humbly seek <strong>Allah's</strong> continuous guidance and grace. It demonstrates the practical application of understanding the scripture – leading to a sincere reliance on <strong>Allah</strong>.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ"},{"verse":"9","text":"\"Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise.\"","commentary":"This verse contains another prayer from those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. They express their firm belief in the <strong>Day of Judgment</strong>, a time when <strong>Allah</strong> will gather all of humanity. They affirm that this day will undoubtedly come and that <strong>Allah</strong> always fulfills His promises. This prayer follows the plea for steadfastness in truth in Verse 8 by looking towards the future and acknowledging <strong>Allah's</strong> ultimate justice and the accountability of all people. It reinforces the theme of faith in <strong>Allah's</strong> power and the consequences of one's actions.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ النَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the fate of believers with that of <strong>disbelievers</strong>. It states that neither their wealth nor their children will provide any protection or benefit them in the face of <strong>Allah's</strong> judgment. Instead, they will become <strong>\"the fuel of the fire,\"</strong> a powerful metaphor for the severe punishment awaiting them. This verse serves as a clear warning following the prayers of the believers in Verses 8 and 9, highlighting the different outcomes based on belief and actions. It underscores the ultimate power and justice of <strong>Allah</strong>, against which worldly possessions hold no value.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَنْ تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"11","text":"(Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, and their predecessors: They denied our Signs, and Allah called them to account for their sins. For Allah is strict in punishment.","commentary":"This verse draws a <strong>parallel between those who currently reject the divine messages and historical examples of people who did the same</strong>, such as the people of the Pharaoh in ancient Egypt and other previous communities. It explains that because these past communities rejected what was revealed to them, <strong>Allah held them accountable for their actions and punished them severely</strong>. This verse <strong>connects to the preceding verse (10)</strong>, which spoke about the lack of benefit for disbelievers from their wealth and offspring on the Day of Judgment. Verse 11 provides historical context and emphasizes that rejecting divine guidance has led to severe consequences in the past, suggesting a similar outcome for those who disbelieve now. It <strong>sets the stage for the following verse (12)</strong> by providing a justification for the warning that is about to be given to the disbelievers.","arabic":"كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Say to those who reject Faith: \"Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell,-an evil bed indeed (to lie on)!","commentary":"This verse contains a <strong>direct address to those who reject the divine messages</strong>, instructing the Prophet to tell them that they <strong>will be defeated and ultimately gathered in hell, described as a terrible destination</strong>. This verse <strong>directly follows Verse 11</strong> by acting as the warning implied by the historical examples of divine retribution. It <strong>leads into Verse 13</strong> by providing a specific example of a situation where believers achieved victory over disbelievers, offering a sign or lesson. Source suggests this verse and the next one are related to the aftermath of the Battle of Badr, where the Prophet urged the Jewish community to accept Islam, using the Quraysh's defeat as a warning.","arabic":"قُلْ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَتُغْلَبُونَ وَتُحْشَرُونَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ ۚ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ"},{"verse":"13","text":"\"There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see.\"","commentary":"This verse refers to a <strong>significant event where two opposing groups met in battle</strong>, one fighting for the cause of <strong>Allah</strong> (meaning, upholding divine principles) and the other being an army of disbelievers. The verse highlights that <strong>one side (likely the disbelievers, or potentially the believers from the perspective of the disbelievers) perceived the other to be twice their size</strong>. Despite this numerical disparity, <strong>Allah grants strength and support to whomever He wills, leading to victory</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>this event serves as a clear sign and a lesson for those who can understand</strong>. This verse <strong>connects to Verse 12</strong> by providing a concrete example of the defeat mentioned in the warning. It <strong>transitions to Verse 14</strong> by shifting the focus from military conflict and its lessons to the allurements and comforts of worldly life, presenting a different kind of test for individuals.","arabic":"قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ آيَةٌ فِي فِئَتَيْنِ الْتَقَتَا ۖ فِئَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَأُخْرَىٰ كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِأُولِي الْأَبْصَارِ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and well-tilled land. Such are the possessions of this world's life; but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals (To return to).","commentary":"This verse speaks about the <strong>natural human inclination towards worldly pleasures</strong>, listing examples such as attraction to family, wealth, and material possessions. It acknowledges that these are <strong>comforts of the present life</strong>. However, the verse emphasizes that <strong>the ultimate and best destination or goal is with Allah</strong>. This verse <strong>follows Verse 13</strong> by introducing a different kind of challenge – the temptation of worldly desires. It <strong>leads into Verse 15</strong> by offering something far better than these worldly comforts for those who are mindful of <strong>Allah</strong>.","arabic":"زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ الشَّهَوَاتِ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ وَالْبَنِينَ وَالْقَنَاطِيرِ الْمُقَنْطَرَةِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ وَالْخَيْلِ الْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَالْأَنْعَامِ وَالْحَرْثِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَاللَّهُ عِنْدَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَآبِ"},{"verse":"15","text":"Say: Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those? For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath; therein is their eternal home; with companions pure (and holy); and the good pleasure of Allah. For in Allah's sight are (all) His servants,-","commentary":"This verse poses a question, inviting people to consider <strong>things that are far superior to the worldly pleasures mentioned in the previous verse</strong>. It states that for those who are <strong>mindful of Allah (Allah-fearing)</strong>, there are <strong>gardens with flowing waters where they will live eternally, companions of perfect purity, and, most importantly, the good pleasure of Allah</strong>. The verse ends by affirming that <strong>Allah is aware of His servants</strong>. This verse <strong>directly connects to Verse 14</strong> by offering a contrasting and better alternative to worldly desires. It <strong>sets the stage for Verse 16</strong> by describing the characteristics and prayers of these Allah-fearing servants who are promised these rewards.","arabic":"قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْ ذَٰلِكُمْ ۚ لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"16","text":"(Namely), those who say: \"Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins, and save us from the agony of the Fire;\"-","commentary":"This verse describes <strong>those who are mindful of Allah</strong> (mentioned in the previous verse) and highlights one of their key characteristics: they <strong>pray to Allah, acknowledging their belief, asking for forgiveness for their wrongdoings, and seeking protection from suffering</strong>. This verse <strong>directly follows Verse 15</strong> by providing an example of the prayers of those who are promised the better rewards. It <strong>connects to Verse 17</strong> by further elaborating on the qualities of these God-conscious individuals.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا إِنَّنَا آمَنَّا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Those who show patience, Firmness and self-control; who are true (in word and deed); who worship devoutly; who spend (in the way of Allah); and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the <strong>qualities of those who are mindful of Allah</strong>, building upon the description that began in Verse 15 and the prayer mentioned in Verse 16. It lists several of their attributes: <strong>patience in difficult times, truthfulness, dedication to spending for good causes, and seeking forgiveness from Allah during the early hours of the morning</strong>. This verse <strong>connects directly to Verse 16</strong> by further detailing the characteristics of the believers whose prayer was mentioned. It <strong>concludes this section (verses 11-17)</strong> by providing a comprehensive picture of those who avoid the negative consequences discussed earlier and attain the superior rewards promised by Allah.","arabic":"الصَّابِرِينَ وَالصَّادِقِينَ وَالْقَانِتِينَ وَالْمُنْفِقِينَ وَالْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِالْأَسْحَارِ"},{"verse":"18","text":"There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and those endued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Power, the Wise.","commentary":"This verse begins by stating that <strong>Allah Himself affirms His absolute oneness</strong>, and this affirmation is supported by the <strong>angels and those who possess knowledge</strong>. This highlights the fundamental principle that there is <strong>no deity other than Allah</strong>. The verse further describes Allah as <strong>the Executor of Justice, the Almighty, and the Wise</strong>. This connects to the preceding verses (although the provided sources don't detail the immediate connection) by continuing the theme of divine attributes and the nature of the divine message. It sets the stage for the following verse (19) by establishing the core belief in the oneness of Allah, which is central to the \"true faith\" discussed next.","arabic":"شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَأُولُو الْعِلْمِ قَائِمًا بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"19","text":"The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.","commentary":"This verse declares that <strong>the only faith truly acceptable to Allah is \"self-surrender\" to Him</strong>. The commentary clarifies that this \"self-surrender\" (which is the meaning of the word \"Islam\" in this context) involves <strong>willing submission, obedience, and consciously following the messenger</strong>. The verse then points out that <strong>disagreements arose among those who had received earlier revelations</strong>, and these disagreements stemmed from <strong>mutual aggression even after knowledge had been given to them</strong>. This connects to the previous verse (18) by stating the consequence of not adhering to the affirmed oneness of Allah, leading to divisions even among those who received divine guidance. It leads to the following verse (20) by addressing what should be said to those who disagree or turn away from this core principle of submission to Allah. The verse also warns that <strong>those who deny Allah's revelations will be swiftly held to account</strong>.","arabic":"إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ ۗ وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"20","text":"So if they dispute with thee, say: \"I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: \"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>guidance on how to respond to those who dispute the message</strong>. It instructs the messenger (and by extension, believers) to <strong>declare their own submission to Allah</strong> and the submission of those who follow them. It then directs them to <strong>ask both those who received previous revelations (like Jews and Christians) and those who were unlettered (often referring to those who did not follow a revealed scripture at the time)</strong> whether they will also submit to Allah. The verse clarifies that <strong>if they submit, they are rightly guided</strong>, but <strong>if they turn away, the messenger's only responsibility is to deliver the message</strong>, and <strong>Allah is aware of His servants</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding verse (19) by outlining the practical response to the disagreements and potential denial of the message. It sets the stage for the following verses (21-22) by describing the consequences for those who not only deny but actively oppose the divine guidance.","arabic":"فَإِنْ حَاجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّهِ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ ۗ وَقُلْ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ وَالْأُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ ۚ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُوا فَقَدِ اهْتَدَوْا ۖ وَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَاغُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"21","text":"As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>severe consequences for those who actively oppose Allah's guidance</strong>. It condemns those who <strong>reject divine revelations, unjustly kill the prophets, and kill those who advocate for fairness and justice among all people</strong>. Such individuals are promised <strong>painful suffering</strong>. This verse connects to the previous verse (20) by detailing the actions of those who turn away in a particularly harmful manner, going beyond mere rejection to active persecution. It leads to the following verse (22) by describing the ultimate outcome of their actions. The commentary suggests this verse has historical relevance to the treatment of prophets and those who preached justice.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ الَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِالْقِسْطِ مِنَ النَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ"},{"verse":"22","text":"They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help.","commentary":"This verse states the <strong>futility of the actions of those described in the previous verse (21)</strong>. Their <strong>efforts and deeds will be without lasting benefit in this life and the hereafter</strong>, and <strong>they will have no one to assist them</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 21, providing the consequence of denying revelations and persecuting prophets and advocates of justice. It connects to the verses that follow (23-25) by shifting focus to the specific case of those who received a share of revelation but still act contrary to it, highlighting the inconsistency of their behavior.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ نَاصِرِينَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah, to settle their dispute, but a party of them Turn back and decline (The arbitration).","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>question prompting reflection on the behavior of those who have been given a portion of divine revelation (such as the Torah for Jews and the Gospel for Christians)</strong>. It highlights the contradiction in their actions: <strong>when invited to resolve their disputes according to Allah's book (understood here as the divine guidance, including what they already possess and the new revelations), some of them reject this and disregard it</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding verse (22) by offering a specific example of those whose works might come to nothing due to their rejection of divine guidance. It leads to the following verse (24) by explaining a possible reason for their contradictory behavior – their false sense of security.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِنَ الْكِتَابِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ وَهُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"This because they say: \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days\": For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion.","commentary":"This verse explains a potential <strong>reason why some of those who received earlier revelations might reject the call to Allah's guidance</strong>: they hold the belief that <strong>any punishment they might receive will be temporary</strong>. This false sense of security stems from <strong>self-created beliefs that have misled them about their faith</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 23 by providing a stated motivation for the refusal to accept divine judgment. It connects to the following verse (25) by questioning what their situation will be when faced with the undeniable reality of the Day of Judgment, contrasting their temporary punishment belief with the permanent consequences.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۖ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِي دِينِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"But how (will they fare) when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned, without (favour or) injustice?","commentary":"This verse poses a <strong>rhetorical question about the fate of those who hold false beliefs and reject divine guidance when they are gathered together on the Day of Judgment</strong>.

This verse connects to the preceding verse (24) by highlighting the stark contrast between their self-deceived belief in limited punishment and the comprehensive justice that will be administered on the Day of Judgment. It leads to the following verses (26-27) by shifting to a declaration of Allah's absolute power and control over all things, including dominion and sustenance, further emphasizing the importance of submitting to Him alone.","arabic":"فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَاهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Say: \"O Allah!

It states that Allah <strong>grants and takes away authority, elevates and humbles individuals according to His will</strong>. It affirms that <strong>all good is within Allah's power and that He is capable of everything</strong>. This verse connects to the previous verse (25) by reminding those who might feel secure in their worldly status or misguided beliefs that ultimate authority and justice belong to Allah alone. It leads to the following verse (27) by further elaborating on Allah's power over the natural order and provision of sustenance. The commentary emphasizes the humility inherent in this address to Allah.","arabic":"قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتَنْزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"27","text":"\"Thou causest the night to gain on the day, and thou causest the day to gain on the night; Thou bringest the Living out of the dead, and Thou bringest the dead out of the Living; and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest, without measure.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the declaration of Allah's absolute power by highlighting His control over the <strong>cycles of day and night, the emergence of life from death and death from life, and the provision of sustenance without measure to whomever He wills</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 26, providing further examples of Allah's comprehensive control and ability over the universe and life itself. It connects to the subsequent verses (although the user's request stops at verse 27) by reinforcing the idea that since Allah has such absolute power and provides for all, reliance and submission should be directed towards Him alone, and alliances with those who reject His guidance are illogical. The commentary suggests that observing these natural phenomena should lead to the understanding that Allah is the ultimate controller.","arabic":"تُولِجُ اللَّيْلَ فِي النَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِي اللَّيْلِ ۖ وَتُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ ۖ وَتَرْزُقُ مَنْ تَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ"},{"verse":"28","text":"Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except by way of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them.

It suggests that forming such primary alliances can create a separation in one's relationship with Allah. However, an exception is made for situations where such outward association is necessary for self-protection. The verse concludes with a strong reminder that <strong>Allah cautions people to be mindful of Him</strong>, as ultimately everyone will be accountable to Him. This verse follows the discussion about Allah's sovereignty and the importance of following divine guidance, suggesting that true loyalty should be rooted in shared faith. The subsequent verses will further elaborate on Allah's knowledge and the concept of accountability.","arabic":"لَا يَتَّخِذِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَنْ تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً ۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ ۗ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"29","text":"Say: \"Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it all: He knows what is in the heavens, and what is on earth.

The verse notes that upon seeing their wrongdoings, people will wish for a great distance between themselves and that moment of reckoning.

The commentary specifically notes that the phrase \"by Allah's leave\" or \"by permission of Allah\" is repeated to emphasize that these miracles come from Allah, not from Jesus himself.","arabic":"وَرَسُولًا إِلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنِّي قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ أَنِّي أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ فَأَنْفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَأُبْرِئُ الْأَكْمَهَ وَالْأَبْرَصَ وَأُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"50","text":"\"'(I have come to you), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was (Before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me.","commentary":"Jesus declares that his mission includes <strong>confirming the truth of the Torah</strong> that was revealed before him. He will also <strong>make lawful for the Children of Israel some things that were previously forbidden to them</strong>. He reiterates that he has come with <strong>a sign from Allah</strong> and calls upon them to <strong>be mindful of Allah and to obey him (Jesus) as the messenger</strong>. This verse emphasizes the continuity of the divine message while also highlighting some specific adjustments in the laws for the Children of Israel. It follows the description of Jesus's miracles and precedes his declaration of the fundamental principle of worshipping Allah alone. The commentary highlights that this verse reveals basic facts about divine religion, emphasizing that the core truth remains consistent across messengers.","arabic":"وَمُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَلِأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ بَعْضَ الَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَجِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ"},{"verse":"51","text":"\"'It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.'\"","commentary":"Jesus concludes his message by proclaiming the fundamental truth: <strong>Allah is his Lord and the Lord of all people</strong>. Therefore, he calls upon them to <strong>worship Allah alone</strong>, stating that this is <strong>the straight path</strong>. This verse encapsulates the core message of monotheism (the belief in one God) preached by Jesus. It follows his statement about confirming the Torah and adjusting some laws, now focusing on the central principle of worship. The commentary emphasizes that Jesus himself was a servant of Allah and that worship should be directed to Allah alone, defining this as \"the straight path\".","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ ۗ هَٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُسْتَقِيمٌ"},{"verse":"52","text":"When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: \"Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah?\" Said the disciples: \"We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims.","commentary":"This verse marks a turning point where <strong>Jesus perceives the rejection of his message by many among the Children of Israel</strong>. He asks, \"<strong>Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah?</strong>\" His <strong>disciples</strong> respond, \"<strong>We are the helpers of Allah. We have believed in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (those who submit to Allah).</strong>\" This verse introduces the concept of disciples who support Jesus and identify themselves with submission to Allah (Islam in its general sense). It follows Jesus's clear message and precedes their prayer to Allah in the next verse. The commentary notes that the term \"Muslim\" here refers to the broad sense of surrender to Allah, which is the essence of true faith.","arabic":"فَلَمَّا أَحَسَّ عِيسَىٰ مِنْهُمُ الْكُفْرَ قَالَ مَنْ أَنْصَارِي إِلَى اللَّهِ ۖ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"53","text":"\"Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness.\"","commentary":"The disciples, having declared themselves helpers of Allah and Muslims, turn to Allah in prayer. They say, \"<strong>Our Lord, we have believed in what You have revealed and have followed the messenger (Jesus), so register us among those who bear witness (to the truth).</strong>\" This prayer expresses their complete faith in Allah's revelations and their commitment to following Jesus. It highlights the importance of witnessing to one's faith through both belief and action. This verse follows the disciples' declaration of support for Jesus and sets a powerful example of their devotion and commitment. The commentary emphasizes that this pledge is made directly to Allah and includes obedience to His messenger, highlighting that faith is not just belief but also a commitment to a way of life. The commentary further explains the significance of being \"those who bear witness,\" implying a practical demonstration of their faith through their lives and striving for its implementation.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا آمَنَّا بِمَا أَنْزَلْتَ وَاتَّبَعْنَا الرَّسُولَ فَاكْتُبْنَا مَعَ الشَّاهِدِينَ"},{"verse":"54","text":"And (the unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is Allah.","commentary":"This verse contrasts two approaches to understanding the scripture. Some individuals deviate from clear, straightforward statements and instead focus on verses that can be interpreted in multiple ways. They do this to support their own preconceived notions, potentially creating division and misrepresenting the teachings. In contrast, true believers wholeheartedly accept all parts of the scripture, understanding that everything comes from Allah and is therefore true, even if the meaning of some parts isn't immediately apparent. This verse sets the stage for discussing specific interpretations that caused disagreement, as seen in the following verses regarding Jesus.","arabic":"وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ"},{"verse":"55","text":"Behold! Allah said: \"O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.","commentary":"This verse provides a historical context for some of the discussions in this passage. It mentions a dialogue where a Christian delegation questioned the Prophet regarding Jesus, citing his description as the \"word of Allah\" and His \"spirit.\" The delegation aimed to use this to argue that Jesus was not merely human but divine. However, the commentary points out that they were selectively focusing on these descriptions while ignoring the many clear verses in the scripture that emphasize the <strong>absolute oneness of Allah</strong> and deny that He has any partners or offspring. This verse connects to the previous one by illustrating the act of \"swerving from the truth\" by prioritizing ambiguous interpretations over clear principles. It also anticipates the subsequent verses that further clarify the status of Jesus.","arabic":"إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَىٰ إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَيَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ ۖ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيمَا كُنْتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ"},{"verse":"56","text":"\"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.\"","commentary":"Moving beyond the specific historical event, this verse explains that the scripture contains two types of statements: clear and precise verses that lay down the fundamental beliefs and practices, and other verses that touch upon realities beyond human comprehension. These latter verses often deal with divine attributes or events that our limited human minds cannot fully grasp. The key is to acknowledge both types, understanding that the clear verses are the foundation, while the less clear ones point to the vastness of Allah's knowledge and power. This verse links the historical discussion of interpretation to a broader understanding of the nature of the scripture itself, preparing for the explanation of how these different types of verses should be approached.","arabic":"فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ نَاصِرِينَ"},{"verse":"57","text":"\"As to those who believe and work righteousness, Allah will pay them (in full) their reward; but Allah loveth not those who do wrong.\"","commentary":"This verse further clarifies the two categories of scriptural statements. The core principles of faith and the guidelines for living are presented clearly and are meant to be understood directly. On the other hand, allegorical statements, such as those concerning the unique birth of Jesus, are presented in a way that requires acceptance based on faith in Allah's word. While their exact nature might be beyond full human understanding, believers trust in their truthfulness because they originate from Allah, the ultimate source of truth. This verse builds upon the previous one by giving examples of each type of verse and explaining why some matters might not be fully comprehensible. It leads into the next verse by discussing how different people react to these two types of revelation.","arabic":"وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"58","text":"\"This is what we rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom.\"","commentary":"This verse highlights the contrasting ways people respond to the scripture. Those who are inclined to deviate from the truth tend to ignore the clear, foundational teachings and instead focus on allegorical verses, twisting their meanings to create confusion and discord. In contrast, those with honest intentions accept all of the scripture as truth from Allah. They understand that while some meanings might be beyond human grasp, the source is infallible. This verse connects to the preceding one by explaining the consequences of different approaches to understanding the scripture and sets the stage for a clear and unambiguous statement about the nature of Jesus.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الْآيَاتِ وَالذِّكْرِ الْحَكِيمِ"},{"verse":"59","text":"The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: \"Be\". And he was.","commentary":"This verse provides a clear and direct explanation of Jesus's status in relation to Allah. It draws a parallel between the creation of Jesus and the creation of Adam. Just as Allah created Adam from dust through His command, Jesus's existence was also brought about by Allah's will and power, without a father in the traditional sense. This verse firmly establishes that Jesus was a created being, like Adam, and not divine in the same way as Allah. It directly counters any interpretations that might elevate Jesus to the level of Allah or His partner, thus addressing the issue raised in earlier verses about differing interpretations. This verse is a crucial pivot point, moving from the general discussion of scripture to a specific theological clarification.","arabic":"إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ ۖ خَلَقَهُ مِنْ تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ"},{"verse":"60","text":"The Truth (comes) from Allah alone; so be not of those who doubt.","commentary":"Following the clear statement about the nature of Jesus, this verse emphasizes the certainty of this truth, stating that it comes directly from Allah. It instructs the Prophet, and by extension all believers, to have no doubt about this understanding. This verse reinforces the message of the previous verse, urging acceptance of the fact that Jesus was a created being similar to Adam. It serves as a direct response to any potential lingering doubts or alternative interpretations that might arise. This verse leads into the next by addressing what to do when faced with continued disagreement despite this clear explanation.","arabic":"الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُنْ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ"},{"verse":"61","text":"If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say: \"Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!\"","commentary":"In the face of persistent disagreement even after clear knowledge has been presented, this verse offers a way to resolve the matter. It instructs the Prophet to propose a mutual supplication (prayer) where both parties bring their families and earnestly pray to Allah, asking for His curse to fall upon those who are knowingly speaking falsehood. This was a profound challenge, signifying a deep conviction in the truth being presented. It served as a final measure when logical arguments and clear evidence were not accepted. This verse follows the affirmation of truth in the previous verse by providing a course of action when that truth is still contested. It sets the stage for the concluding verses of this section by indicating a point where further debate might be futile.","arabic":"فَمَنْ حَاجَّكَ فِيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَنِسَاءَنَا وَنِسَاءَكُمْ وَأَنْفُسَنَا وَأَنْفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَلْ لَعْنَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَاذِبِينَ"},{"verse":"62","text":"This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise.","commentary":"After outlining the process for resolving disputes through prayer, this verse reiterates the fundamental truth at the heart of the matter: <strong>there is no deity except Allah</strong>. It further emphasizes Allah's attributes of being the Mighty (All-Powerful) and the Wise (All-Knowing). This reinforces the core message of monotheism that has been central to the discussion about Jesus and the interpretation of scripture. It follows the challenge in the previous verse by returning to the foundational principle. This verse leads into the next by addressing the consequences of rejecting this clear truth.","arabic":"إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ الْقَصَصُ الْحَقُّ ۚ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ۚ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"63","text":"But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief.","commentary":"This verse addresses the outcome if those who are presented with the clear truth and even offered a chance for mutual prayer still choose to reject it. It states that Allah is fully aware of those who turn away and, in doing so, spread corruption (which can include the corruption of beliefs and the creation of discord). This serves as a warning to those who stubbornly refuse to accept the truth after it has been made clear to them. It follows the reaffirmation of Allah's oneness and power in the previous verse by highlighting the consequences of disbelief. This verse prepares for the final call in the subsequent verse.","arabic":"فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِالْمُفْسِدِينَ"},{"verse":"64","text":"Say: \"O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.\" If then they turn back, say ye: \"Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah's Will).","commentary":"This concluding verse presents a final, unifying invitation to the \"People of earlier revelations\" (understood to primarily refer to Jews and Christians). It proposes a fair and common ground: to worship Allah alone, to not associate any partners with Him, and to not treat each other as lords or deities besides Allah. This invitation emphasizes the core principle of monotheism that is shared across the Abrahamic faiths. If this equitable agreement is rejected, then the believers are instructed to declare that they have submitted themselves to Allah (which is the meaning of the word \"Muslim\"). This verse summarizes the main themes of the passage – the oneness of Allah, the rejection of associating partners with Him, and the call for submission to Him alone. It provides a clear point of distinction between those who accept this foundational principle and those who do not.","arabic":"قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"65","text":"Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding?","commentary":"This section of the commentary begins by setting the stage for a discussion about the <strong>religious disagreements between the early Muslim community and the followers of earlier scriptures, specifically Jews and Christians</strong>. It highlights that the verses in this part of the Quran (65-92) address the various challenges and oppositions faced by Islam. These included attempts to undermine the faith through <strong>scheming, spreading misinformation, and questioning the truthfulness of the Muslim message</strong>. The overarching goal of this portion is to assure the early Muslims of the <strong>validity of their beliefs</strong> and to expose the <strong>flawed arguments of those who opposed them</strong>. It also aims to <strong>caution Muslims against placing undue trust in those who were actively trying to harm their faith</strong>.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تُحَاجُّونَ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمَا أُنْزِلَتِ التَّوْرَاةُ وَالْإِنْجِيلُ إِلَّا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ ۚ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ"},{"verse":"66","text":"Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing (Even) in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not!","commentary":"Continuing the theme from the previous verse's overview, the commentary specifically mentions the questioning of the <strong>Prophet Abraham's religious affiliation</strong> by both Jewish and Christian communities. Each group claimed Abraham as a follower of their own faith, despite Abraham preceding both Judaism and Christianity. The commentary clarifies that <strong>Abraham was devoted to the concept of submission to the one God (Allah)</strong>, which is the essence of Islam. Therefore, the individuals most closely aligned with Abraham are <strong>those who followed his monotheistic belief, the Prophet Muhammad, and all true believers in one God</strong>. This verse establishes a <strong>historical continuity of the belief in one God</strong> and positions Islam within that tradition. It also states that <strong>Allah is the protector of all true believers</strong>. This would serve to reassure the early Muslim community amidst the controversies.","arabic":"هَا أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ حَاجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَاجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"67","text":"Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah's (Which is Islam), and he joined not gods with Allah.","commentary":"This verse further elaborates on the point made in the commentary of verse 66, directly stating that <strong>Abraham was neither Jewish nor Christian</strong>. This is a logical assertion, as the scriptures of Judaism (Torah) and Christianity (Gospel) were revealed after Abraham's time. Instead, the commentary emphasizes that <strong>Abraham was solely devoted to Allah, having submitted himself to Him</strong>, and he did not associate any partners with Allah. In essence, Abraham was a <strong>\"Muslim\" in the broader sense of the word, meaning someone who submits to the one God</strong>. This verse serves to <strong>dispel the claims of exclusive affiliation to Abraham</strong> by Jews and Christians and highlights the <strong>universal and timeless nature of the core message of Islam: the absolute oneness of Allah</strong>.","arabic":"مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَٰكِنْ كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"},{"verse":"68","text":"Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith.","commentary":"Building upon the clarification of Abraham's true faith in the previous verse, this verse identifies <strong>who has the strongest connection to Abraham</strong>. According to the commentary, it is <strong>those who followed Abraham's way, the Prophet Muhammad, and all who are true believers in Allah</strong>. This verse reinforces the idea that <strong>religious legitimacy comes from adhering to the core principle of submission to the one God</strong>, as exemplified by Abraham and continued by Prophet Muhammad and his followers. It concludes by stating that <strong>Allah is the guardian and protector of these believers</strong>, offering reassurance and a sense of divine support to the early Muslim community facing opposition. This verse connects the historical figure of Abraham directly to the nascent Muslim community.","arabic":"إِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَٰذَا النَّبِيُّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ"},{"verse":"69","text":"It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray. But they shall lead astray (Not you), but themselves, and they do not perceive!","commentary":"This verse shifts to describe the <strong>intentions of some among the \"people of earlier revelations\" (Jews and Christians) towards the Muslim community</strong>. The commentary states that a faction among them <strong>wished to lead the Muslims astray from their faith</strong>. This desire stemmed from their <strong>grudge and envy</strong> that the Muslims had received divine guidance. However, the commentary notes that in their attempts to mislead others, <strong>they only misled themselves without realizing it</strong>. This verse serves as a <strong>warning to the Muslim community about the potential deceptive tactics of their opponents</strong> and underscores the idea that those who harbor ill intentions ultimately harm themselves. It follows the establishment of the true followers of Abraham by highlighting those who deviate from that true path and seek to cause deviation in others.","arabic":"وَدَّتْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"},{"verse":"70","text":"Ye People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, of which ye are (Yourselves) witnesses?","commentary":"Continuing the address to the \"people of earlier revelations,\" this verse, as explained by the commentary, questions <strong>why they would disbelieve in Allah's revelations when they themselves had knowledge and bore witness to their truth</strong>. This suggests that they had access to previous scriptures that contained prophecies or indications of the truth of the message brought by Prophet Muhammad. The commentary highlights the <strong>inconsistency of their disbelief despite their own knowledge</strong>. This verse serves to <strong>challenge the intellectual honesty of the opponents of Islam</strong>, pointing out the contradiction between their knowledge and their rejection of the new revelation. It directly follows the description of their desire to mislead, now questioning their very basis for disbelief.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ"},{"verse":"71","text":"Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood, and conceal the Truth, while ye have knowledge?","commentary":"This verse further criticizes the behavior of some among the \"people of earlier revelations,\" accusing them of <strong>intentionally mixing truth with falsehood and knowingly concealing the truth</strong>. The commentary suggests that they deliberately obscured or misinterpreted their own scriptures to contradict or undermine the message of Islam. This action is portrayed as a <strong>serious offense</strong>. This verse emphasizes the <strong>dishonest tactics employed by some opponents of Islam</strong>, highlighting their deliberate attempt to confuse and mislead both their own communities and the Muslims. It builds upon the previous verse by detailing the active steps they took beyond mere disbelief.","arabic":"يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ الْحَقَّ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ الْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"72","text":"A section of the People of the Book say: \"Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) Turn back;","commentary":"The commentary explains that this verse reveals a specific tactic employed by a group among the \"people of earlier revelations\". They would <strong>pretend to believe in what was revealed to the Muslims at the beginning of the day and then deny it at the end of the day</strong>. The purpose of this strategy was to <strong>sow doubt among the Muslims and make them question their own faith</strong>, hoping they would revert to their previous beliefs. This verse exposes a calculated attempt to <strong>create internal division and instability within the early Muslim community</strong> by manipulating appearances and playing on potential insecurities about their new faith. It follows the accusation of mixing truth and falsehood by describing a concrete method used to achieve their deceptive goals.","arabic":"وَقَالَتْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ آمِنُوا بِالَّذِي أُنْزِلَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَجْهَ النَّهَارِ وَاكْفُرُوا آخِرَهُ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ"},{"verse":"73","text":"\"And believe no one unless he follows your religion.\" Say: \"True guidance is the Guidance of Allah: (Fear ye) Lest a revelation be sent to someone (else) Like unto that which was sent unto you? or that those (Receiving such revelation) should engage you in argument before your Lord?\" Say: \"All bounties are in the hand of Allah: He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things.\"","commentary":"This verse, according to the commentary, contains an instruction to the \"people of earlier revelations\" from a faction among themselves: <strong>\"Do not really trust anyone except those who follow your own faith\"</strong>. Following this, the commentary includes the statement: <strong>\"Say: All true guidance is Allah’s guidance\"</strong>. This is presented as a response to their exclusionary advice, emphasizing that <strong>true guidance comes solely from Allah</strong>, not from adhering to any particular group. The verse further mentions their concern that <strong>others might receive similar divine favor or knowledge</strong>. This reveals their <strong>jealousy and resentment</strong> towards the idea that Allah might choose to bestow His grace upon others. This verse exposes the <strong>in-group bias and possessiveness</strong> of some opponents of Islam regarding divine guidance, countered by the assertion that guidance is Allah's prerogative.","arabic":"وَلَا تُؤْمِنُوا إِلَّا لِمَنْ تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَىٰ هُدَى اللَّهِ أَنْ يُؤْتَىٰ أَحَدٌ مِثْلَ مَا أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَاجُّوكُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ الْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"74","text":"For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He pleaseth; for Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded.","commentary":"Continuing from the previous verse, this verse includes the statement: <strong>\"Say: Grace is in Allah’s hand: He bestows it on whom He wills. Allah is Munificent and All-Knowing. He singles out for His mercy whom He wills. And Allah’s grace is great indeed\"</strong>. This is presented as a direct <strong>response to the envy</strong> expressed by some among the \"people of earlier revelations\" regarding divine favor. It asserts Allah's absolute authority and wisdom in <strong>choosing whom to bless with His grace and mercy</strong>, including prophethood and revelation. The commentary highlights that Allah's bestowal of guidance upon the Muslim community was an act of His <strong>infinite generosity and knowledge</strong>, especially considering the deviations of those who had received earlier revelations. This verse serves to <strong>affirm the divine origin and legitimacy of Islam</strong> and to counter any feelings of inferiority or doubt the early Muslims might have felt due to the opposition they faced. It directly addresses the concern raised in the previous verse about who receives divine favor.","arabic":"يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ"},{"verse":"75","text":"Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily) pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, they say, \"there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (Pagans).\" but they tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it.","commentary":"This verse begins a discussion about <strong>trustworthiness among the \"people of earlier revelations\"</strong>. The commentary notes that the Quran presents a <strong>fair assessment</strong>, acknowledging that some among them would honor a trust, even with significant wealth. However, it also states that others would be dishonest even with a small amount unless constantly watched. The commentary attributes this behavior to their belief that <strong>they have no obligation to be fair with \"Gentiles\" (non-Jews)</strong>. This verse provides a <strong>nuanced view</strong> of the opponents of Islam, acknowledging that not all were dishonest while pointing out specific ethical issues and biases that existed within some of these communities. It marks a slight shift from directly addressing their deceptive tactics to examining their broader ethical conduct.","arabic":"وَمِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ مَنْ إِنْ تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنْطَارٍ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ إِنْ تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لَا يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ إِلَّا مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَائِمًا ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِي الْأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"76","text":"Nay.- Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright,-verily Allah loves those who act aright.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the rationalization of dishonesty by some among the \"people of earlier revelations,\" stating that <strong>they deliberately attribute their biased claims to Allah, which they know to be false</strong>. The commentary connects this back to their assertion that they have no obligation towards non-Jews, implying they falsely claimed divine sanction for this discriminatory view. This verse further <strong>condemns the practice of misrepresenting religious teachings for self-serving purposes</strong>, highlighting the serious nature of such actions. It directly follows the previous verse by explaining the underlying justification (albeit a false one) for the lack of trustworthiness observed in some individuals.","arabic":"بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَىٰ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ"},{"verse":"77","text":"As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will Allah (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty.","commentary":"This verse follows the previous one, which discussed individuals who manipulate religious texts for their own benefit. Verse 77 speaks about the <strong>consequences for those who break their agreements with Allah and their solemn promises for small, worldly advantages</strong>. This could refer to betraying their faith or any other serious commitments for selfish reasons. It suggests that such actions will have negative repercussions in the future, implying a lack of divine favor, communication, or forgiveness, and ultimately leading to significant hardship. This verse sets the stage for further discussion on the importance of upholding commitments and the negative impact of prioritizing worldly gains over spiritual principles.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا أُولَٰئِكَ لَا خَلَاقَ لَهُمْ فِي الْآخِرَةِ وَلَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ وَلَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ"},{"verse":"78","text":"There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of the Book; and they say, \"That is from Allah,\" but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it!","commentary":"This verse continues the theme of misrepresenting religious teachings, specifically focusing on some individuals among those who had received previous scriptures (like the Jewish and Christian traditions of the time). It describes how they would <strong>distort the scriptures through the way they spoke</strong>, making it sound like their own interpretations or fabrications were actually part of the divine texts. The verse emphasizes the deliberate nature of this deception, highlighting that they would claim their words were from Allah when they knew this was not true. This action is presented as a knowing falsehood about Allah. This verse connects to the broader theme in this section of addressing controversies around religious beliefs and exposing the deceptive tactics used by some to mislead others. The following verses will likely contrast this behavior with genuine faith and understanding.","arabic":"وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقًا يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِالْكِتَابِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"79","text":"It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the prophetic office, should say to people: \"Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah's\": on the contrary (He would say) \"Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly.\"","commentary":"Building upon the exposure of those who falsely attribute words to Allah, this verse clarifies the <strong>true nature of prophethood</strong>. It asserts that it is illogical for someone chosen by Allah and given divine guidance to then ask people to worship them instead of Allah. Instead, true prophets would call people to be devoted servants of Allah, grounded in the knowledge and study of the scriptures. The verse further emphasizes that prophets would not ask people to deify angels or other prophets. It ends with a rhetorical question, highlighting the inconsistency of a prophet leading people away from belief in Allah after they have already submitted to Him. This verse serves as a clear statement against any form of worship other than that of Allah and establishes the role of prophets as guides to Allah, not as deities themselves. It sets the stage for further defining the correct path of belief and the dangers of deviation.","arabic":"مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَنْ يُؤْتِيَهُ اللَّهُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُوا عِبَادًا لِي مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِنْ كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ"},{"verse":"80","text":"Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (To Allah in Islam)?","commentary":"This verse is a continuation of the thought in the previous verse, further emphasizing that a true messenger of Allah would never instruct people to <strong>take angels or previous prophets as objects of worship</strong>. It reiterates the rhetorical question about leading people to disbelief after they have already submitted to Allah. This reinforces the central theme of the absolute oneness of Allah and the prohibition of associating any partners with Him in worship. It likely leads to further explanation of what true submission to Allah entails.","arabic":"وَلَا يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَنْ تَتَّخِذُوا الْمَلَائِكَةَ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ أَرْبَابًا ۗ أَيَأْمُرُكُمْ بِالْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"81","text":"Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: \"I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help.\" Allah said: \"Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you?\" They said: \"We agree.\" He said: \"Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.\"","commentary":"This verse shifts to the <strong>covenant that Allah made with all the prophets</strong>. It describes an agreement where if a future messenger came confirming their existing scriptures and wisdom, they were obligated to believe in and support that messenger. Allah asks the prophets if they acknowledged and accepted this binding commitment, to which they replied in the affirmative. Allah then instructs them to bear witness to this, stating that He too is among the witnesses. This verse highlights the <strong>continuity of the divine message</strong> across different prophets and scriptures. It implies that the arrival of a new prophet confirming previous teachings should be welcomed and accepted by those who truly believe in the earlier messages. This likely connects to the resistance faced by the latest messenger (understood within the Islamic context to be Prophet Muhammad) from some who followed earlier scriptures.","arabic":"وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ النَّبِيِّينَ لَمَا آتَيْتُكُمْ مِنْ كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُصَدِّقٌ لِمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنْصُرُنَّهُ ۚ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِي ۖ قَالُوا أَقْرَرْنَا ۚ قَالَ فَاشْهَدُوا وَأَنَا مَعَكُمْ مِنَ الشَّاهِدِينَ"},{"verse":"82","text":"If any turn back after this, they are perverted transgressors.","commentary":"This verse is a direct consequence of the covenant described in the preceding verse. It states that <strong>anyone among the prophets' followers who turns away</strong> from believing in and supporting a messenger who confirms their existing scriptures, after this covenant was established, <strong>are considered defiantly disobedient</strong>. This emphasizes the seriousness of rejecting a messenger who aligns with and validates previous divine teachings. It suggests that true adherence to past scriptures necessitates acceptance of subsequent confirming messengers. This verse likely serves as a strong statement against those who rejected the message brought by the final prophet in the Islamic tradition, despite its consistency with earlier divine messages.","arabic":"فَمَنْ تَوَلَّىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ"},{"verse":"83","text":"Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah?-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back.","commentary":"This verse presents a rhetorical question challenging those who <strong>seek a religious path different from that of Allah (which is understood here as submission to Him)</strong>. It points out that everything in the universe, whether consciously or through the natural laws governing it, is in a state of submission to Allah. The verse ends by stating that ultimately, everyone will return to Allah. This emphasizes the <strong>universality of submission to Allah</strong> and questions the logic of choosing a different religious path. It reinforces the idea that the natural order itself reflects submission to the Divine. This verse likely leads to a more explicit declaration of what constitutes acceptable religion in Allah's sight.","arabic":"أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ اللَّهِ يَبْغُونَ وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ"},{"verse":"84","text":"Say: \"We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam).\"","commentary":"Following the assertion of the universality of submission to Allah, this verse provides a clear statement of <strong>belief for the followers of the final messenger (in the Islamic context)</strong>. It instructs them to declare their belief in Allah, in what has been revealed to them (the Qur'an in the Islamic context), and in the revelations given to earlier prophets, including Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, their descendants, Moses, Jesus, and all other prophets from their Lord. A key principle highlighted is that <strong>no distinction is made between any of these prophets</strong>; they are all respected as messengers of Allah. The verse concludes by reaffirming their submission to Allah. This verse emphasizes the <strong>inclusive nature of this belief system</strong>, acknowledging the divine origin of previous messages and the unity of the prophetic tradition. It sets the stage for the following verse, which will likely define the consequences of seeking a different religious path.","arabic":"قُلْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ"},{"verse":"85","text":"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good).","commentary":"This verse directly follows the declaration of belief in Allah and all His prophets and scriptures. It firmly states that <strong>anyone who seeks a religion other than submission to Allah (Islam in its broad sense of complete surrender and obedience to the Divine)</strong>, that religion will not be accepted from them. Furthermore, it declares that in the life to come, such individuals will be among those who have lost. This verse emphasizes the <strong>centrality of submission to Allah</strong> as the only acceptable religious path. It serves as a clear and decisive statement about the consequences of choosing a different way after the truth has been made clear. The next verse will likely address the state of those who knowingly reject this truth after having once accepted it.","arabic":"وَمَنْ يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ"},{"verse":"86","text":"How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? but Allah guides not a people unjust.","commentary":"This verse addresses a specific situation: <strong>how can Allah provide guidance to those who rejected belief after having once believed, acknowledged the truthfulness of the messenger, and received clear evidence of the truth?</strong>. It suggests that such a deliberate turning away from the truth after understanding it creates a barrier to divine guidance. The verse concludes by stating a general principle: <strong>Allah does not guide those who deliberately wrong themselves</strong> by rejecting the clear truth. This verse highlights the responsibility individuals have towards the truth once it becomes clear to them and the consequences of knowingly turning away from it. It sets the stage for the subsequent verses that will describe the punishment for such individuals.","arabic":"كَيْفَ يَهْدِي اللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُوا بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَشَهِدُوا أَنَّ الرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ"},{"verse":"87","text":"Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of His angels, and of all mankind;-","commentary":"This verse questions how <strong>Allah</strong>, the Almighty, can provide guidance to those who once believed but then rejected their faith after having clear signs and understanding. It emphasizes that <strong>Allah's guidance is not for those who knowingly turn away from the truth and act wrongly</strong>. This verse follows the previous discussion about the true nature of Islam as complete submission to <strong>Allah</strong> and highlights the consequences of deliberately rejecting this truth. It sets the stage for the next verse by describing the immediate consequence of such wrongdoing: the curse of <strong>Allah</strong>, the angels, and all people.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ جَزَاؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ"},{"verse":"88","text":"In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened, nor respite be (their lot);-","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>severe consequence for those who knowingly reject the truth after having embraced it</strong>: they will be under the condemnation of <strong>Allah</strong>, the angels, and all humanity. This verse builds directly upon the question posed in the previous verse about the possibility of guiding such individuals. It leads into the next verse by detailing the nature of this condemnation, stating that it is everlasting and without relief.","arabic":"خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لَا يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلَا هُمْ يُنْظَرُونَ"},{"verse":"89","text":"Except for those that repent (Even) after that, and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the <strong>punishment for those who reject faith after clear guidance</strong>: they will remain under this condemnation permanently. Their suffering will not be lessened, and they will not be given any relief. This verse further elaborates on the severity of the consequences mentioned in the previous verse. It offers a contrast with the following verse, which introduces an exception for those who repent and mend their ways.","arabic":"إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"90","text":"But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray.","commentary":"This verse introduces an important <strong>exception to the severe consequences described earlier</strong>: those who later turn back to faith, sincerely regret their actions, and correct their behavior will find <strong>Allah</strong> to be forgiving and merciful. This verse provides a note of hope after the stern warnings of the preceding verses. However, it is immediately followed by a verse that clarifies the status of those who persist in disbelief after initially believing.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ ثُمَّ ازْدَادُوا كُفْرًا لَنْ تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الضَّالُّونَ"},{"verse":"91","text":"As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous, and they will find no helpers.","commentary":"This verse distinguishes between those who genuinely repent and those who relapse into disbelief and become even more entrenched in their rejection of faith. For the latter, <strong>their repentance will not be accepted</strong>, and they are considered to have strayed far from the right path. This verse clarifies the limits of forgiveness mentioned in the previous verse, emphasizing the importance of sincerity and the danger of persistent disbelief. It leads into the final verse of this passage by reiterating the consequence for those who die in disbelief.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِمْ مِلْءُ الْأَرْضِ ذَهَبًا وَلَوِ افْتَدَىٰ بِهِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ نَاصِرِينَ"},{"verse":"92","text":"By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and whatever ye give, of a truth Allah knoweth it well.","commentary":"This verse concludes this passage by stating the fate of those who <strong>persist in disbelief until their death</strong>: no amount of compensation, even if it were the entire earth filled with gold offered as a ransom, will be accepted. They will face severe suffering without any assistance. The verse ends with a seemingly different topic, stating that <strong>true goodness (piety) cannot be achieved unless one gives to others from what they value most</strong>. This final statement shifts the focus from the consequences of disbelief to a positive act of faith, highlighting the importance of selfless giving as a path towards genuine righteousness. This may serve as a concluding thought, contrasting the negative outcome of disbelief with a positive action encouraged for believers.","arabic":"لَنْ تَنَالُوا الْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنْفِقُوا مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ ۚ وَمَا تُنْفِقُوا مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ"}];
