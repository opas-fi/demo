    const verses = [{"verse":"1","text":"A. L. M.","commentary":"This verse begins with three Arabic letters: <strong>Alif, Lam, Mim</strong>. These letters are presented at the start of this chapter (sura) of the Quran to draw the attention of the audience to the very building blocks of the Arabic language itself. The Quran, despite being composed of these familiar letters, is presented as a unique and inimitable text. This is similar to a challenge posed in a previous chapter, asking people to produce even a single chapter comparable to it if they doubted its divine origin. In this chapter, this reference to the letters serves to highlight that this book comes from <strong>Allah</strong>, the one and only divine being, yet it is in the same language as the people it addresses, including those of earlier faiths.","arabic":"الم"},{"verse":"2","text":"Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal.","commentary":"This verse establishes the <strong>absolute oneness of Allah</strong>. It declares that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. Allah is described as <strong>\"the Ever-living,\"</strong> possessing true and unrestricted life, and <strong>\"the Eternal Master of all,\"</strong> the one who gives and sustains all existence. This fundamental principle distinguishes the Islamic faith from all other beliefs and ideologies, including those that involve multiple gods or ascribe divine attributes to created beings. This verse follows the introduction in Verse 1 by immediately stating the core message of the divine book: the uniqueness of Allah as the sole source of existence and authority.","arabic":"اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ"},{"verse":"3","text":"It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).","commentary":"This verse states that <strong>Allah</strong> has revealed the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad with the truth. It also clarifies that <strong>Allah</strong> had previously revealed the Torah to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus. The Quran is presented as <strong>confirming the truths</strong> found in these earlier scriptures. This verse builds upon the declaration of Allah's oneness in Verse 2 by showing that this same <strong>Allah</strong> is the source of guidance throughout history, providing continuity between different divine messages.","arabic":"نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَأَنْزَلَ التَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنْجِيلَ"},{"verse":"4","text":"Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution.","commentary":"Continuing from Verse 3, this verse explains that the Torah and the Gospel were revealed as <strong>guidance for people</strong>. It further states that <strong>Allah</strong> has revealed the Quran as <strong>\"the Criterion,\"</strong> a means to distinguish what is true from what is false. The verse then warns that those who reject <strong>Allah's</strong> revelations will face severe suffering, emphasizing <strong>Allah's</strong> power and ability to deliver justice. This verse connects to the previous one by highlighting the purpose of divine revelation and the consequences of disbelief in it.","arabic":"مِنْ قَبْلُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَأَنْزَلَ الْفُرْقَانَ ۗ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ"},{"verse":"5","text":"From Allah, verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens.","commentary":"This verse asserts the <strong>absolute knowledge of Allah</strong>. It emphasizes that nothing, whether on Earth or in the heavens, is concealed from Him. This statement reinforces the attributes of <strong>Allah</strong> mentioned in Verse 2 (the Eternal Master) and Verse 4 (the Mighty, able to requite) by highlighting His complete awareness of all things. This provides a context for the warning given in the previous verse, as <strong>Allah</strong> is fully aware of those who disbelieve.","arabic":"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ"},{"verse":"6","text":"He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","commentary":"This verse speaks of <strong>Allah's</strong> <strong>creative power</strong>. It states that He is the one who forms individuals in the wombs according to His will. The verse reiterates that there is no deity except Him, and describes Him as <strong>\"the Almighty,\"</strong> possessing the power to shape and fashion creation, and <strong>\"the Wise,\"</strong> who determines everything according to His perfect wisdom. This verse connects to the previous one by giving a personal example of <strong>Allah's</strong> knowledge and power, demonstrating His intimate involvement in the creation of human beings. It also serves to counter any claims of divine partnership by affirming <strong>Allah's</strong> sole authority and wisdom in creation.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الْأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"7","text":"He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:\" and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.","commentary":"This verse explains that the Quran contains two types of verses: <strong>clear and precise verses</strong>, which form the foundation of the Book, and <strong>allegorical verses</strong>, which may have more than one interpretation. The verse notes that those who deviate from the truth tend to focus on the allegorical verses to create division and misinterpret them. It emphasizes that only <strong>Allah</strong> knows the ultimate meaning of these allegorical verses. In contrast, those who are firmly grounded in knowledge believe in all the verses, both clear and allegorical, recognizing that they all come from <strong>Allah</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that only those with true understanding and insight will take heed of this guidance. This verse builds upon the previous ones by explaining the nature of the revealed text itself and how different people approach it. It cautions against misinterpreting scripture and highlights the importance of recognizing <strong>Allah</strong> as the ultimate source of understanding.","arabic":"هُوَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ ۖ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَاءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَاءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ ۗ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ۗ وَالرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِنْ عِنْدِ رَبِّنَا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّا أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ"},{"verse":"8","text":"\"Our Lord!\" (they say), \"Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure.","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>prayer of those who are firmly grounded in knowledge</strong> and have taken heed of the guidance in the Quran. They pray to <strong>Allah</strong> to keep their hearts steadfast on the truth after He has guided them. They also ask for His mercy, acknowledging Him as the ultimate source of all good. This prayer reflects the attitude of true believers who, having understood the nature of the Quran as explained in Verse 7, humbly seek <strong>Allah's</strong> continuous guidance and grace. It demonstrates the practical application of understanding the scripture – leading to a sincere reliance on <strong>Allah</strong>.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ"},{"verse":"9","text":"\"Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise.\"","commentary":"This verse contains another prayer from those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. They express their firm belief in the <strong>Day of Judgment</strong>, a time when <strong>Allah</strong> will gather all of humanity. They affirm that this day will undoubtedly come and that <strong>Allah</strong> always fulfills His promises. This prayer follows the plea for steadfastness in truth in Verse 8 by looking towards the future and acknowledging <strong>Allah's</strong> ultimate justice and the accountability of all people. It reinforces the theme of faith in <strong>Allah's</strong> power and the consequences of one's actions.","arabic":"رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ النَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ"},{"verse":"10","text":"Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire.","commentary":"This verse contrasts the fate of believers with that of <strong>disbelievers</strong>. It states that neither their wealth nor their children will provide any protection or benefit them in the face of <strong>Allah's</strong> judgment. Instead, they will become <strong>\"the fuel of the fire,\"</strong> a powerful metaphor for the severe punishment awaiting them. This verse serves as a clear warning following the prayers of the believers in Verses 8 and 9, highlighting the different outcomes based on belief and actions. It underscores the ultimate power and justice of <strong>Allah</strong>, against which worldly possessions hold no value.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَنْ تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"11","text":"(Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, and their predecessors: They denied our Signs, and Allah called them to account for their sins. For Allah is strict in punishment.","commentary":"This verse draws a <strong>parallel between those who currently reject the divine messages and historical examples of people who did the same</strong>, such as the people of the Pharaoh in ancient Egypt and other previous communities. It explains that because these past communities rejected what was revealed to them, <strong>Allah held them accountable for their actions and punished them severely</strong>. This verse <strong>connects to the preceding verse (10)</strong>, which spoke about the lack of benefit for disbelievers from their wealth and offspring on the Day of Judgment. Verse 11 provides historical context and emphasizes that rejecting divine guidance has led to severe consequences in the past, suggesting a similar outcome for those who disbelieve now. It <strong>sets the stage for the following verse (12)</strong> by providing a justification for the warning that is about to be given to the disbelievers.","arabic":"كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ"},{"verse":"12","text":"Say to those who reject Faith: \"Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell,-an evil bed indeed (to lie on)!","commentary":"This verse contains a <strong>direct address to those who reject the divine messages</strong>, instructing the Prophet to tell them that they <strong>will be defeated and ultimately gathered in hell, described as a terrible destination</strong>. This verse <strong>directly follows Verse 11</strong> by acting as the warning implied by the historical examples of divine retribution. It <strong>leads into Verse 13</strong> by providing a specific example of a situation where believers achieved victory over disbelievers, offering a sign or lesson. Source suggests this verse and the next one are related to the aftermath of the Battle of Badr, where the Prophet urged the Jewish community to accept Islam, using the Quraysh's defeat as a warning.","arabic":"قُلْ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَتُغْلَبُونَ وَتُحْشَرُونَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ ۚ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ"},{"verse":"13","text":"\"There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see.\"","commentary":"This verse refers to a <strong>significant event where two opposing groups met in battle</strong>, one fighting for the cause of <strong>Allah</strong> (meaning, upholding divine principles) and the other being an army of disbelievers. The verse highlights that <strong>one side (likely the disbelievers, or potentially the believers from the perspective of the disbelievers) perceived the other to be twice their size</strong>. Despite this numerical disparity, <strong>Allah grants strength and support to whomever He wills, leading to victory</strong>. The verse concludes by stating that <strong>this event serves as a clear sign and a lesson for those who can understand</strong>. This verse <strong>connects to Verse 12</strong> by providing a concrete example of the defeat mentioned in the warning. It <strong>transitions to Verse 14</strong> by shifting the focus from military conflict and its lessons to the allurements and comforts of worldly life, presenting a different kind of test for individuals.","arabic":"قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ آيَةٌ فِي فِئَتَيْنِ الْتَقَتَا ۖ فِئَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَأُخْرَىٰ كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِأُولِي الْأَبْصَارِ"},{"verse":"14","text":"Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and well-tilled land. Such are the possessions of this world's life; but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals (To return to).","commentary":"This verse speaks about the <strong>natural human inclination towards worldly pleasures</strong>, listing examples such as attraction to family, wealth, and material possessions. It acknowledges that these are <strong>comforts of the present life</strong>. However, the verse emphasizes that <strong>the ultimate and best destination or goal is with Allah</strong>. This verse <strong>follows Verse 13</strong> by introducing a different kind of challenge – the temptation of worldly desires. It <strong>leads into Verse 15</strong> by offering something far better than these worldly comforts for those who are mindful of <strong>Allah</strong>.","arabic":"زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ الشَّهَوَاتِ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ وَالْبَنِينَ وَالْقَنَاطِيرِ الْمُقَنْطَرَةِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ وَالْخَيْلِ الْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَالْأَنْعَامِ وَالْحَرْثِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَاللَّهُ عِنْدَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَآبِ"},{"verse":"15","text":"Say: Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those? For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath; therein is their eternal home; with companions pure (and holy); and the good pleasure of Allah. For in Allah's sight are (all) His servants,-","commentary":"This verse poses a question, inviting people to consider <strong>things that are far superior to the worldly pleasures mentioned in the previous verse</strong>. It states that for those who are <strong>mindful of Allah (Allah-fearing)</strong>, there are <strong>gardens with flowing waters where they will live eternally, companions of perfect purity, and, most importantly, the good pleasure of Allah</strong>. The verse ends by affirming that <strong>Allah is aware of His servants</strong>. This verse <strong>directly connects to Verse 14</strong> by offering a contrasting and better alternative to worldly desires. It <strong>sets the stage for Verse 16</strong> by describing the characteristics and prayers of these Allah-fearing servants who are promised these rewards.","arabic":"قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْ ذَٰلِكُمْ ۚ لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَاجٌ مُطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"16","text":"(Namely), those who say: \"Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins, and save us from the agony of the Fire;\"-","commentary":"This verse describes <strong>those who are mindful of Allah</strong> (mentioned in the previous verse) and highlights one of their key characteristics: they <strong>pray to Allah, acknowledging their belief, asking for forgiveness for their wrongdoings, and seeking protection from suffering</strong>. This verse <strong>directly follows Verse 15</strong> by providing an example of the prayers of those who are promised the better rewards. It <strong>connects to Verse 17</strong> by further elaborating on the qualities of these God-conscious individuals.","arabic":"الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا إِنَّنَا آمَنَّا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ"},{"verse":"17","text":"Those who show patience, Firmness and self-control; who are true (in word and deed); who worship devoutly; who spend (in the way of Allah); and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning.","commentary":"This verse continues to describe the <strong>qualities of those who are mindful of Allah</strong>, building upon the description that began in Verse 15 and the prayer mentioned in Verse 16. It lists several of their attributes: <strong>patience in difficult times, truthfulness, dedication to spending for good causes, and seeking forgiveness from Allah during the early hours of the morning</strong>. This verse <strong>connects directly to Verse 16</strong> by further detailing the characteristics of the believers whose prayer was mentioned. It <strong>concludes this section (verses 11-17)</strong> by providing a comprehensive picture of those who avoid the negative consequences discussed earlier and attain the superior rewards promised by Allah.","arabic":"الصَّابِرِينَ وَالصَّادِقِينَ وَالْقَانِتِينَ وَالْمُنْفِقِينَ وَالْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِالْأَسْحَارِ"},{"verse":"18","text":"There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and those endued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Power, the Wise.","commentary":"This verse begins by stating that <strong>Allah Himself affirms His absolute oneness</strong>, and this affirmation is supported by the <strong>angels and those who possess knowledge</strong>. This highlights the fundamental principle that there is <strong>no deity other than Allah</strong>. The verse further describes Allah as <strong>the Executor of Justice, the Almighty, and the Wise</strong>. This connects to the preceding verses (although the provided sources don't detail the immediate connection) by continuing the theme of divine attributes and the nature of the divine message. It sets the stage for the following verse (19) by establishing the core belief in the oneness of Allah, which is central to the \"true faith\" discussed next.","arabic":"شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَأُولُو الْعِلْمِ قَائِمًا بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ"},{"verse":"19","text":"The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.","commentary":"This verse declares that <strong>the only faith truly acceptable to Allah is \"self-surrender\" to Him</strong>. The commentary clarifies that this \"self-surrender\" (which is the meaning of the word \"Islam\" in this context) involves <strong>willing submission, obedience, and consciously following the messenger</strong>. The verse then points out that <strong>disagreements arose among those who had received earlier revelations</strong>, and these disagreements stemmed from <strong>mutual aggression even after knowledge had been given to them</strong>. This connects to the previous verse (18) by stating the consequence of not adhering to the affirmed oneness of Allah, leading to divisions even among those who received divine guidance. It leads to the following verse (20) by addressing what should be said to those who disagree or turn away from this core principle of submission to Allah. The verse also warns that <strong>those who deny Allah's revelations will be swiftly held to account</strong>.","arabic":"إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ ۗ وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۗ وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ"},{"verse":"20","text":"So if they dispute with thee, say: \"I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: \"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.","commentary":"This verse provides <strong>guidance on how to respond to those who dispute the message</strong>. It instructs the messenger (and by extension, believers) to <strong>declare their own submission to Allah</strong> and the submission of those who follow them. It then directs them to <strong>ask both those who received previous revelations (like Jews and Christians) and those who were unlettered (often referring to those who did not follow a revealed scripture at the time)</strong> whether they will also submit to Allah. The verse clarifies that <strong>if they submit, they are rightly guided</strong>, but <strong>if they turn away, the messenger's only responsibility is to deliver the message</strong>, and <strong>Allah is aware of His servants</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding verse (19) by outlining the practical response to the disagreements and potential denial of the message. It sets the stage for the following verses (21-22) by describing the consequences for those who not only deny but actively oppose the divine guidance.","arabic":"فَإِنْ حَاجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّهِ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ ۗ وَقُلْ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ وَالْأُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ ۚ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُوا فَقَدِ اهْتَدَوْا ۖ وَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَاغُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"21","text":"As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty.","commentary":"This verse describes the <strong>severe consequences for those who actively oppose Allah's guidance</strong>. It condemns those who <strong>reject divine revelations, unjustly kill the prophets, and kill those who advocate for fairness and justice among all people</strong>. Such individuals are promised <strong>painful suffering</strong>. This verse connects to the previous verse (20) by detailing the actions of those who turn away in a particularly harmful manner, going beyond mere rejection to active persecution. It leads to the following verse (22) by describing the ultimate outcome of their actions. The commentary suggests this verse has historical relevance to the treatment of prophets and those who preached justice.","arabic":"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ الَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِالْقِسْطِ مِنَ النَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ"},{"verse":"22","text":"They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help.","commentary":"This verse states the <strong>futility of the actions of those described in the previous verse (21)</strong>. Their <strong>efforts and deeds will be without lasting benefit in this life and the hereafter</strong>, and <strong>they will have no one to assist them</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 21, providing the consequence of denying revelations and persecuting prophets and advocates of justice. It connects to the verses that follow (23-25) by shifting focus to the specific case of those who received a share of revelation but still act contrary to it, highlighting the inconsistency of their behavior.","arabic":"أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ نَاصِرِينَ"},{"verse":"23","text":"Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah, to settle their dispute, but a party of them Turn back and decline (The arbitration).","commentary":"This verse presents a <strong>question prompting reflection on the behavior of those who have been given a portion of divine revelation (such as the Torah for Jews and the Gospel for Christians)</strong>. It highlights the contradiction in their actions: <strong>when invited to resolve their disputes according to Allah's book (understood here as the divine guidance, including what they already possess and the new revelations), some of them reject this and disregard it</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding verse (22) by offering a specific example of those whose works might come to nothing due to their rejection of divine guidance. It leads to the following verse (24) by explaining a possible reason for their contradictory behavior – their false sense of security.","arabic":"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِنَ الْكِتَابِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِنْهُمْ وَهُمْ مُعْرِضُونَ"},{"verse":"24","text":"This because they say: \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days\": For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion.","commentary":"This verse explains a potential <strong>reason why some of those who received earlier revelations might reject the call to Allah's guidance</strong>: they hold the belief that <strong>any punishment they might receive will be temporary</strong>. This false sense of security stems from <strong>self-created beliefs that have misled them about their faith</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 23 by providing a stated motivation for the refusal to accept divine judgment. It connects to the following verse (25) by questioning what their situation will be when faced with the undeniable reality of the Day of Judgment, contrasting their temporary punishment belief with the permanent consequences.","arabic":"ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا لَنْ تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلَّا أَيَّامًا مَعْدُودَاتٍ ۖ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِي دِينِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا يَفْتَرُونَ"},{"verse":"25","text":"But how (will they fare) when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned, without (favour or) injustice?","commentary":"This verse poses a <strong>rhetorical question about the fate of those who hold false beliefs and reject divine guidance when they are gathered together on the Day of Judgment</strong>. It emphasizes the certainty of this Day, where <strong>every individual will be justly recompensed for their actions, receiving exactly what they have earned without any injustice</strong>. This verse connects to the preceding verse (24) by highlighting the stark contrast between their self-deceived belief in limited punishment and the comprehensive justice that will be administered on the Day of Judgment. It leads to the following verses (26-27) by shifting to a declaration of Allah's absolute power and control over all things, including dominion and sustenance, further emphasizing the importance of submitting to Him alone.","arabic":"فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَاهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ"},{"verse":"26","text":"Say: \"O Allah! Lord of Power (And Rule), Thou givest power to whom Thou pleasest, and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest: Thou enduest with honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: In Thy hand is all good. Verily, over all things Thou hast power.","commentary":"This verse contains a <strong>prayer or declaration acknowledging Allah as the ultimate sovereign and controller of all power</strong>. It states that Allah <strong>grants and takes away authority, elevates and humbles individuals according to His will</strong>. It affirms that <strong>all good is within Allah's power and that He is capable of everything</strong>. This verse connects to the previous verse (25) by reminding those who might feel secure in their worldly status or misguided beliefs that ultimate authority and justice belong to Allah alone. It leads to the following verse (27) by further elaborating on Allah's power over the natural order and provision of sustenance. The commentary emphasizes the humility inherent in this address to Allah.","arabic":"قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتَنْزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"27","text":"\"Thou causest the night to gain on the day, and thou causest the day to gain on the night; Thou bringest the Living out of the dead, and Thou bringest the dead out of the Living; and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest, without measure.\"","commentary":"This verse continues the declaration of Allah's absolute power by highlighting His control over the <strong>cycles of day and night, the emergence of life from death and death from life, and the provision of sustenance without measure to whomever He wills</strong>. This verse directly follows Verse 26, providing further examples of Allah's comprehensive control and ability over the universe and life itself. It connects to the subsequent verses (although the user's request stops at verse 27) by reinforcing the idea that since Allah has such absolute power and provides for all, reliance and submission should be directed towards Him alone, and alliances with those who reject His guidance are illogical. The commentary suggests that observing these natural phenomena should lead to the understanding that Allah is the ultimate controller.","arabic":"تُولِجُ اللَّيْلَ فِي النَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِي اللَّيْلِ ۖ وَتُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ ۖ وَتَرْزُقُ مَنْ تَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ"},{"verse":"28","text":"Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except by way of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (To remember) Himself; for the final goal is to Allah.","commentary":"This verse addresses those who have embraced the faith, advising them <strong>not to prioritize alliances with those who do not share their beliefs over those who do</strong>. It suggests that forming such primary alliances can create a separation in one's relationship with Allah. However, an exception is made for situations where such outward association is necessary for self-protection. The verse concludes with a strong reminder that <strong>Allah cautions people to be mindful of Him</strong>, as ultimately everyone will be accountable to Him. This verse follows the discussion about Allah's sovereignty and the importance of following divine guidance, suggesting that true loyalty should be rooted in shared faith. The subsequent verses will further elaborate on Allah's knowledge and the concept of accountability.","arabic":"لَا يَتَّخِذِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَنْ تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً ۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ ۗ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ"},{"verse":"29","text":"Say: \"Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it all: He knows what is in the heavens, and what is on earth. And Allah has power over all things.","commentary":"This verse instructs the Prophet to convey that <strong>Allah is fully aware of everyone's innermost thoughts and intentions, whether they are hidden or expressed openly</strong>. It emphasizes Allah's comprehensive knowledge, encompassing everything in existence. Furthermore, it highlights <strong>Allah's absolute power and ability to do all things</strong>. This verse connects with the previous one by reinforcing the idea that Allah is aware of the nature of people's alliances and their underlying motives. It also sets the stage for the following verse, which speaks about the day of reckoning, where these known actions and intentions will be brought to account by the All-Powerful and All-Knowing Allah.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ تُخْفُوا مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ اللَّهُ ۗ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ"},{"verse":"30","text":"\"On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good it has done, and all the evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distance between it and its evil. But Allah cautions you (To remember) Himself. And Allah is full of kindness to those that serve Him.\"","commentary":"This verse describes a future time when <strong>every individual will be faced with a full record of their good and bad deeds</strong>. The verse notes that upon seeing their wrongdoings, people will wish for a great distance between themselves and that moment of reckoning. It reiterates <strong>Allah's warning to be mindful of Him</strong>, but it immediately follows this with the assurance that <strong>Allah is Most Compassionate towards His servants</strong>. This verse builds upon the previous one by detailing the implications of Allah's knowledge – that actions have consequences. It also offers a balance by highlighting Allah's compassion, suggesting that while accountability is inevitable, so is His mercy. The next verses will focus on how to attain Allah's love and forgiveness.","arabic":"يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُحْضَرًا وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ سُوءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدًا بَعِيدًا ۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ"},{"verse":"31","text":"Say: \"If ye do love Allah, Follow me: Allah will love you and forgive you your sins: For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"","commentary":"This verse presents a path to earning Allah's love and forgiveness. It instructs the Prophet to tell people that <strong>if they truly love Allah, they should follow his guidance</strong>. The verse states that as a result of following this guidance, <strong>Allah will love them and pardon their wrongdoings</strong>. It concludes by emphasizing Allah's attributes of being <strong>Much-Forgiving and Merciful</strong>. This verse connects with the preceding one by offering a way for individuals who might fear the consequences of their actions to seek Allah's mercy through following the prescribed path. It leads into the next verse, which further emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah and the messenger.","arabic":"قُلْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ"},{"verse":"32","text":"Say: \"Obey Allah and His Messenger\": But if they turn back, Allah loveth not those who reject Faith.","commentary":"This verse reinforces the theme of obedience, instructing people to <strong>obey Allah and the messenger</strong>. It then states that <strong>if people choose to disregard this command and turn away, then Allah does not love those who reject guidance</strong>. This verse follows the previous one by stressing that love for Allah is demonstrated through obedience. It clarifies that rejecting this path of obedience leads to a state where one is not in Allah's favor. This passage (verses 28-32) collectively emphasizes the importance of sincere faith, the consequences of one's choices, Allah's comprehensive knowledge and power, and the path to His love and forgiveness through following divine guidance.","arabic":"قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ ۖ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ"}];
